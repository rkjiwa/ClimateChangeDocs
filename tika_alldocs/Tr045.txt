Ministry  of Forest and Range (MoFR) Future Forest Ecosystems Initiative (FFEI).  These papers will increase the awareness of the potential impact of climate  change on forest and range resources in British Columbia. They will also pro- vide information to aid in assessing the vulnerability of British Columbia’s  forest and range resources and their management, leading to the develop- ment of adaptation strategies for a changing climate. The FFEI was initiated  by the Chief Forester with a symposium and workshop in December 2005. At  the same time the MoFR Climate Change Task Team was preparing a report  on how the MoFR should strategically position itself with respect to the po- tential impacts of climate change on the province’s forest and range resources.  The present report draws on the Task Team report, recommendations from  the FFEI workshop, and numerous other documents including the most   recent reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. It pro- vides a summary of future possible climates for British Columbia, a brief  review of possible impacts on forest and range resources, and options for and  challenges to adapting to climate change. Finally, there are recommendations  on how the MoFR might respond to climate change. The report contains four  appendices that expand on material presented in the body of the report, in- cluding information on the past as well as on future climates of British  Columbia.    iv  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  The Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate  Change states that warming of the climate system is unequivocal. It notes  with a very high level of confidence that much of this warming is due to  human activities through the release of greenhouse gases. The continued in- crease in greenhouse gas concentration over the next century could result in  an increase in global mean annual temperatures by up to 4°C and changes in  precipitation regimes. The rate of warming will be faster than has occurred   in the past and there will be an increase in the frequency and intensity of ex- treme temperature and precipitation events.  British Columbia will have greater warming and changes in the precipita- tion regime than the global average. All models and emissions scenarios  predict an increase in winter and summer temperature. Warming would be  greater in northern British Columbia than in southern British Columbia and  larger in the winter than in the summer, particularly in the winter minimum  temperature. Warming is least in coastal areas where it is moderated by the  oceans.  If there is limited success internationally to control future emissions (e.g.,  the A2 emissions scenario), British Columbia could see a warming of 3–5°C  by the 2080s. With significant reduction in emissions (e.g., the B emission  scenarios), the warming is 2–3°C by the 2080s. These two scenarios have the  winter minimums in northern British Columbia increasing by 4–9°C by the  2080s and summer maximums increasing by 3–4°C. The frost-free period,  growing-degree days, and frequency of extremely warm days will also increase.   Changes in precipitation will accompany changes in temperature. South- ern and central British Columbia are expected to see the summer  precipitation decreasing by 0–40% by 2080s under all emission scenarios.  Summers in northern British Columbia range from a small decrease to a 25%  increase. Winters will be wetter across British Columbia, with increases rang- ing from 5 to 40%, depending on the emissions scenario and global climate  model. We can expect an increase in precipitation intensity and reduction in  the return period of extreme events. In most cases, the changes in mean pre- cipitation are smaller than the inter-annual variability in precipitation  resulting from inter-annual and inter-decadal variation in ocean conditions.  Warming will result in less precipitation falling as snow, reduced snowpack  depth, and earlier spring snowmelt, with the snow disappearing up to a  month earlier under the highest warming scenarios. There will be an increase  in evaporative demand of the atmosphere.  Ecosystems and species have responded to past changes in climate; how- ever, future responses may not be compatible with our patterns of use or  desires. Consequently, there could be significant biological, economic, and  social impacts with major implications for resource management. Species  will be able to survive and grow in their current location under a changing  climate. However, growth rates will be affected and there will be increased  competition from other species or genotypes more suited to the climate.  Warming and drying will increase forest fire frequency and severity. Distur- bance due to insects and disease is expected to increase and this will likely  have significant negative impacts on the forest and range carbon balance. The  potential ranges of species will move northward and upward in elevation, and  new assemblages of species will occur in space and time. Species may be un-    v  able to move into areas of suitable climate due to barriers to movement, slow  migration rates, unsuitable growing substrate, or lack of habitat.  Although many of the impacts of climate change are decades away, re- source managers need to start evaluating the vulnerability of forest and range  resources to climate change. This will facilitate development of adaptation  strategies to maintain the resilience of ecological systems and our uses of  them. A guide to such activities and some challenges to implementing adap- tation strategies are identified. A major challenge is the uncertainty in the  magnitude and timing of future climate change. Another significant chal- lenge is the size of the forest and range land base in British Columbia. It is  likely that much of the vegetation will have to adjust without human inter- vention, and society will have to adapt to this. In some areas, adaptation to  reduce the vulnerability of resources such as water quality and quantity, and  biological conservation, may become the highest priorities.  The various emissions scenarios have similar warming trends over the  next 20 years. During this period the global response to the risks of climate  change should become evident, the resolution and capabilities of global cli- mate models will improve, and we should have a clearer idea of the climate  change to expect. This period should also see significant improvements in  our understanding of the vulnerability of forest and range resources to cli- mate change. In the meantime, it is recommended that:  • Vulnerability analyses use climate simulations for the B and A2 scenarios,  and simulations from at least two global climate models with different cli- matologies (e.g., the Canadian and Hadley Centre models).  • Analyses should use annual, as well as mean, data to evaluate the effects of  changes in the inter-annual variability, and the frequency and intensity of  extremes.  It is recommended that the B.C. Ministry of Forests and Range respond   to the potential impacts of climate change on forest and range management  by co-operating with other agencies and groups in taking the lead to:  • Develop databases and methods for assessing vulnerabilities to climate  change and promote adaptation in forest and range management.  • Create a set of climate-change scenarios for British Columbia at a high  spatial resolution so that all users can work from a common database.  • Provide a “one stop” facility that is a source of climate-change scenarios  and other climate data for vulnerability analyses, and would facilitate ac- cess to the latest information.  • Determine user needs with respect to climate variables, time periods, and  tools for climate-change vulnerability analyses.  • Develop adaptive capacity within the forest and range management com- munity.  • Develop a set of key indicators of climate change that can help in monitor- ing the response of forest and range resources to climate change.  • Investigate management responses that can be applied in the short term  that might alleviate some of the vulnerability without compromising the  long term.  Current actions by the Ministry of Forest and Range and the British   Columbia provincial government are addressing many of these recommenda- tions.    ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  Comments by reviewers on earlier drafts are gratefully acknowledged. Dis- cussions with Trevor Murdock, Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium (PCIC),  and the provision of climate change scenarios by PCIC, were particularly  helpful. Interpolation and interpretation of climate change data for British  Columbia would not have been possible without the ClimateBC software   developed by Andreas Hamann (University of Alberta) and Tong-Li Wang  (University of British Columbia). ClimateBC was made possible by funding  from the Forest Investment Account–Forest Science Program and the Minis- try of Forests and Range. Adrian Walton (MoFR) provided the high spatial  resolution maps of current and future British Columbia climates. Responsi- bility for the interpretation of data and any errors are solely the responsibility  of the author.    “There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers ex- actly what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly  disappear and be replaced by something more bizarre and inex- plicable.

Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate  Change (IPPC WG I 2007) reports that over the last 00 years there has been   a 0.7°C warming of the global climate. The report states with a very high   level of confidence that much of this warming is a result of human activities  through the release of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere from the burning  of fossil fuels, deforestation, and agricultural activities. IPCC WG I (2007)  presents a range of future greenhouse gas emission scenarios based on esti- mates of economic growth, technological development, and international  co-operation. Even the most optimistic scenarios require a few decades   before emissions start to decline. According to the climate models, a global  warming of –4°C is possible by the end of the century along with an increase  in the frequency and intensity of extreme temperature and precipitation  events. Canadell et al. (2007) report that current emissions are now higher  than those used in the IPCC WG I (2007) analyses.   Changes in British Columbia’s climate over the last 00 years are consistent  with global trends (B.C. Ministry of Water, Land and Air Protection 2002;  Vincent and Mekis 2006; Rodenhuis et al. 2007; Pike et al. 2008a,b). Al- though ecosystems and species have responded to past changes in climate,  future responses may not be compatible with our patterns of use or desires.  Consequently, there will be significant economic and social as well as biologi- cal impacts (McCarthy et al. 200; Spittlehouse and Stewart 2003; IPCC WG II  2007). Although large changes in climatic conditions may not occur for de- cades, resource managers must start developing responses now to adapt to  the future climate and ecological conditions.  Before we can implement adaptive actions we need predictions of possible  future climates and we need to assess vulnerabilities. In doing this it is im- portant to recognize the scale of the issue and to manage expectations of our  ability to respond. For example, the size of the forested land base in British  Columbia means that much of the forest will have to adjust without human  intervention. Adaptation will likely focus on the major commercial tree spe- cies and perhaps a few animal species, while most of forest plants and  animals will have to adapt as best they can.  This paper describes some possible future climates for British Columbia  and briefly reviews possible impacts. This is followed by a framework to help  resource managers evaluate vulnerabilities to climate change and to deter- mine adaptive actions (Spittlehouse and Stewart 2003; Ohlson et al. 2005;  Spittlehouse 2005; Johnson and Williamson 2007). Challenges to adapting to  climate change are also reviewed. Additional reference material can be found  in the Appendices. A companion paper (Campbell et al. 2008) is addressing  how we might manage forest ecosystems in an era of rapid environmental  change.    2  BRITISH COLUMBIA’S FUTURE CLIMATES   Future global  temperature and   precipitation regimes   Forecasts of future climates are available from numerous global climate mod- els (GCMs). These models simulate oceanic and atmospheric processes and  their interaction with the land surface for a range of future greenhouse gas  emission scenarios. These scenarios depend on future developments in tech- nology, economic growth, and international co-operation (IPCC WG  2007).  The GCMs are also a source of variability in the future climate simulations be- cause of differences in how certain processes are modelled. A wide range of  climate variables are available from the models. However, it is useful to focus  on the average values of temperature and precipitation variables for certain  periods. The models simulate well the rise in temperature over the last centu- ry, showing the influence of past increases in greenhouse gas concentrations  (Hengeveld et al. 2005). At present, no one simulated future climate should  be considered more likely than another.  Predictions of the change in mean annual temperature for the suite of  global climate models and scenarios used in the Fourth Assessment (IPCC  WG I 2007) are shown in Figure .

Solid lines are multi-model global averages of  surface warming (relative to 1980–1999) for the scenarios A2, A1B, and B1,  shown as continuations of the 20th-century simulations. Shading denotes the  ±1 standard deviation range of individual model annual averages. The orange  line is for the experiment where concentrations were held constant at year  2000 values. The grey bars at right indicate the best estimate (solid line within  each bar) and the likely range assessed for the six SRES marker scenarios. The  assessment of the best estimate and likely ranges in the grey bars includes  the Atmosphere-Ocean Global Climate Models in the left part of the figure,  as well as results from a hierarchy of independent models and observational  constraints. (Figure SPM.5 in IPCC WG I 2007.) The B1 and A2 carbon dioxide  emission scenarios are shown in Figure A4, Appendix 2.    3  of –6°C by 200 are indicated. The A2 scenario assumes that emissions will  continue to increase without significant efforts globally to reduce them   (Figure A4, Appendix 2). The B scenario assumes that the rate of emissions  will slow down and begin to decrease by the middle of the century. The or- ange line shows that even with an immediate cessation of all emissions we are  committed to a further 0.5°C warming above current conditions. Changes in  temperature will be accompanied by changes in precipitation. Summer pre- cipitation is predicted to decrease in equatorial and temperate latitudes but   to increase in northern latitudes (Figure A6, Appendix 2). In the winter, the  precipitation increase is greater than in summer and the increase tends to   extend into the temperature latitudes.   All of the scenarios predict similar warming trends over the next 20 years.  During this period, the response of the global community to calls for reduc- ing emissions should become evident. Also, the GCMs will have improved  such that we should have a much better idea of the climate change to expect  for 2050 and beyond. It is accepted that emissions of greenhouse gases cannot  cease immediately. Consequently, emission reduction targets have been pro- posed to limit warming to certain levels or to avoid certain climate impacts  (Rive et al. 2007). Weaver et al. (2007) note that a reduction in emissions is  not sufficient to avoid certain negative impacts and that we will require direct  capture of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.  British Columbia’s  future temperature   and precipitation  regimes     The data presented in this section are based on the Intergovernmental Panel  on Climate Change’s Third Assessment Report (Houghton et al. 200) as well  as the recent Fourth Assessment Report (IPCC WG I 2007). The Fourth As- sessment uses a reference period of 980–999, which is about 0.5°C warmer  for British Columbia than the 96–990 period used in the Third Assessment  (Rodenhuis et al. 2007). However, allowing for the different reference period,  the predicted climate changes for the various emission scenarios in the Third  Assessment are similar to those in the Fourth Assessment (Rodenhuis et al.  2007).  Table 1   Changes in temperature and precipitation predicted for British Columbia for 2020s, 2050s, and  2080s from seven global climate models and for eight emission scenarios. Data are changes  from 1961–1990 climate expressed as a change in mean temperature or as a percentage  change in total precipitation (PPT %). The range of the data represents the differences in the  emission scenarios and in the climate models. Values are based on data at www.ccsn.ca and  www.pacificclimate.org/scenarios/.    2020 2050 2080   Temp. °C PPT  % Temp. °C PPT  % Temp. °C PPT  %  Southern British Columbia Winter 0 to 2 -5 to +15 1.5 to 3.5 0 to +20 2 to 7 0 to 25 Summer 0.5 to 2 -30  to +5 1.5 to 4 -35  to 0 2.5 to 7.5 -50  to 0  Central British Columbia Winter 0 to 2 -5 to +15 1.5 to 4 0 to +30 2.5 to 6 +5 to +40 Summer 0.5 to 1.5 -10  to +5 1.8 to 3.5 -20 to 0 2.5 to 6.5 -20  to +5  Northern British Columbia  Winter 0 to 2.5 0 to 20 1.5 to 5.5 0 to +25 2.5 to 9 0  to +45 Summer 0.5 to 1.5 -10  to +10 1.5 to 3.5 -10  to +15 2 to 6 -15  to +25    4  British Columbia will have greater warming and changes in precipitation  than the global average (Table , Appendix 2). All models and emissions sce- narios predict a continued increase in temperature. There is a tendency for  the warming to be greatest in northern British Columbia and greater in the  winter than in the summer. This warming is largest in the winter minimum  temperature. Changes in precipitation vary in space as well as time. Southern  and central British Columbia are expected to get drier in the summer, while  northern British Columbia is more likely to be wetter. Winters will likely be  wetter across all of British Columbia.   The global climate models provide climate-change data at a coarse scale.  These data were downscaled with the ClimateBC software that uses the delta  method to produce values for individual locations and as high spatial resolu- tion gridded data (Spittlehouse 2006; Wang et al. 2006a). The high resolution  of the figures does not imply a high accuracy. Climates for the B and A2  emissions scenarios (Figure A4, Appendix 2) are from the Canadian Global  Climate Model version 2 (CGCM2) (Flato et al. 2000). The simulated climates  are in the middle of the range of projections of the various GCMs and span  the range of the most likely future climates for British Columbia. Mean annu- al changes in temperature and precipitation for the A2 scenario are presented  in Figures 2 and 3. Seasonally based climate maps and data for selected loca- tions in British Columbia for the B and A2 scenarios are presented in  Appendix 2.   The A2 scenario predicts a warming of 3–5°C across British Columbia  over the next century (Figure 2). The lower emissions for the B scenario re- sult in a warming of 2–3°C by 2080, similar to that for the A2 in 2050 (Tables  A2 and A3, Appendix 2). Annually, most of British Columbia is predicted to  have an increase in precipitation that continues to increase over time. Sea- sonal data presented in Appendix 2 show that the southern half of the  province could be drier in the summer. The increase in winter precipitation   is large enough to result in an increase on an annual basis. Changes in mean  precipitation are smaller than the inter-annual variability that results from  inter-annual and inter-decadal changes in ocean conditions. As with temper- ature, the B precipitation climate of 2080 is similar to that of the A2 in 2050.  In contrast to CGCM2 simulations, the Hadley Centre HadCM3 model tends  to produce a warmer and drier summer for the A2 scenario.   Changes in temperature and precipitation influence other climate vari- ables of interest in resource management. Under the B and A2 scenarios  frost-free periods and growing-degree days will increase (Tables A2 and A3,   Appendix 2). The depth of the snowpack and length of the snow season will  decrease by up to a month while the atmospheric evaporative demand and  climatic moisture deficits will likely increase (Appendix 2; Huntington 2008;  Pike et al. 2008b).  The data presented above are average conditions for specific time periods.  Inter-annual variability in weather conditions and frequency and magnitude  of extreme conditions also has a significant effect on the production and use  for forest and range resources. Analyses on a global basis from the Fourth  Assessment (Tebaldi et al. 2006; Kharin et al. 2007) are applicable to British  Columbia.     5  2050s 2080s  2020s1961–1990  Figure 2   Mean annual temperature for British Columbia for 1961–1990 and that predicted for British Columbia in 2020s,  2050s, and 2080s for the A2 scenario from CGCM2.

Extreme maximum temperatures would be higher than at present  and cold extremes will warm faster, particularly in areas that see a retreat of  snow with warming. There will also be an increase in intensity and maximum  amount of precipitation. For both temperature and precipitation there will be  a reduction in return periods of current extreme events (Tebaldi et al. 2006;  Kharin et al. 2007), and it is very likely we will see an increase in the number  of heat waves and heavy precipitation events (IPCC WG II 2007).    6  IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON BRITISH COLUMBIA’S FOREST AND  RANGE RESOURCES  There are numerous reports worldwide of the response of plants and animals  to the increase in temperature in over the last century (Walther et al. 2002;  Breshears et al. 2005, Gulledge 2006; Parmesan 2006; IPCC WG II 2007). Brit- ish Columbia is already experiencing biological and physical responses that  at least may partially be a response to current climate changes (Leith and  Whitfield 998; BCMWLAP 2002; Carroll et al. 2004; Gillet et al. 2004; Woods  et al. 2005; Geertsema et al. 2006; Pike et al. 2008a). These responses will be  exacerbated under the climate changes described in the previous section.   IPCC WG II (2007) states that climate impacts will be mostly negative and  will fall hardest on those least able to adapt to changes, such as the poor, de- veloping countries, and certain ecosystems. Extreme heat events could   1961–1990 Mean Annual Precipitation (mm)  2020s  2050s 2080s  10400  2500  1000  600  200  Figure 3   Mean annual precipitation for British Columbia for 1961–90 and the percentage change predicted for British  Columbia in 2020s, 2050s, and 2080s for the A2 scenario from CGCM2.

Warming  will result in an increase in forest disturbance by drought, fire, insects, and  disease.  Sea-level rise will be a threat to coastal communities and result in a  loss of estuarine ecosystems. Although some high-latitude areas may see im- provements in the growth of crops, global mean losses for a 4°C warming  could be –5% of gross domestic product. Not every one will bear the costs  equally.   British Columbia’s 60 million hectares of forest and range provide a wide  range of resources for human use. Wood-based products, such as lumber,   oriented strand board, and paper, and other forest products, such as mush- rooms, berries, and botanicals, are important for the provincial economy.  Forests are the source of many streams that are the water supply for human  consumption. Forest and range provide habitat for fish and other wildlife, are  important reserves for endangered species, provide areas for recreation in all  seasons, and are culturally and spiritually significant. Although British Co- lumbia may be less vulnerable economically, socially, and climatically than  some other countries, impacts will be significant and require responses.  Some generalizations can be made on species responses to climate change.  The potential ranges of species will move northward and upward in elevation,  and new assemblages of species will occur in space and time (Cummings and  Burton 996; Hebda 997, 998, 2007; Hansen et al. 200; Hamann and Wang  2006; Wang et al. 2006b). Using ecosystem-based climate envelop modelling,  Hamann and Wang (2006) found that tree species with their northern range  limit in British Columbia could gain climatically suitable habitat at about 00  km per decade. Common hardwoods appeared to be less sensitive to climate  change while some of the most important conifer species in British Columbia  lost a large portion of their climatically suitable habitat. However, species  may be unable to move into areas where the climate is suitable because of  barriers to movement, slow migration rates, unsuitable growing substrate,   or lack of habitat (Stewart et al. 998; Gray 2005).   Optimum growing conditions for local populations (genotypes) of trees  can be relatively narrow (Rehfeldt et al. 999, 200; Parker et al. 2000; Wang  et al. 2006b). Consequently, although species will be able to survive and grow  in their current location under a changed climate, growth rates will be affect- ed and there will be increased competition from other species or genotypes  more suited to the climate. Concurrent with a changing climate are changes  in the frequency and intensity of disturbance by fire, insects, and disease  (Sieben et al. 997; Dale et al. 200; Flannigan et al. 2005; Volney and Hirsh  2005). Insects and diseases may adapt to new environmental conditions more  quickly than their long-lived hosts (Cammell and Knight 992; Volney and  Hirsh 2005).  Forest management, as well as species occurrence and growth, will be af- fected by climate change. For example, access to sites for harvesting, fire  protection activity, and road design and maintenance are all weather-depen- dent activities (Spittlehouse and Stewart 2003). The role of forests and forest  management in the global carbon balance will be affected by climate change  through changes in forest growth and disturbance. Future disturbances by  fire, insects, and disease will likely have a much greater influence on the car- bon balance than changes in tree species occurrence and growth rates (Kurz  et al. 2007, 2008a, b). Further discussions on the implications of climate  change for British Columbia’s ecosystems can be found in Appendix 3.    8  A GUIDE TO DEVELOPING ADAPTATION STRATEGIES  Adapting to climate change reduces vulnerability. This reduces risks and capi- talizes on benefits by maintaining social and ecological resilience (Nelson et  al. 2007). Vulnerability is the degree to which an entity (e.g., organism, eco- system, company, community, or province) is susceptible to or unable to cope  with climate change (Smit and Pilifosova 2002). Different entities are vulner- able to different aspects of change, and what may be detrimental to one entity  could be beneficial to another.   Determining adaptive actions requires a framework for analysis (Spittle- house and Stewart 2003; Kellomäki and Leinonen 2005; Metzger and  Schroter 2006; Johnson and Williamson 2007). The first step of the proce- dure involves defining the issue; second is evaluating vulnerability to the  changing climate; third is determining how to reduce vulnerability (i.e., ad- aptation); and fourth is implementing an adaptation strategy. For example:   • Issue: Define the subject, scale, and time (i.e., the resource issue of con- cern, the location, and the future time horizon).   • Vulnerability assessment: Select a range of climate-change scenarios for  the chosen time horizon. Determine the climatic, economic, social, and  other factors that influence the vulnerability of the resource. A lack of in- formation on the climate sensitivity of the resources in question should  not stall the process of making a first-cut vulnerability assessment. Edu- cated guesses may be required at the beginning, but the analysis is an  iterative process, with continual updating of the vulnerability assessment  as more information becomes available. Different issues, people, compa- nies, and organizations will have different timeframes to consider and  different vulnerabilities.  • Adaptation strategy: Determine what needs to be done to reduce vulner- ability. Options can be developed and their cost-effectiveness evaluated.  Extension activities will be a critical component for the strategy. Immedi- ate activities include those that facilitate future responses to reduce  vulnerability. Adaptation strategies must include the ability to incorporate  new knowledge about the future climate and forest vulnerabilities as they  are developed. They should also recognize the impediments to implemen- tation, such as funding, policy, resistance to change, and risk aversion. It is  unlikely that any single issue or value can be considered in isolation. Thus,  an important component of adaptation is balancing different timeframes,  needs, and values. An adaptation strategy should include a monitoring  program to determine the state of the forest and to evaluate the success   of the adaptation strategy.  • Implementing the adaptation strategy: This step should be self-evident.  As noted above, this is an iterative process and the vulnerability assess- ments and adaptation strategies will be revisited as more information   such as improved simulations of future climate becomes available.  There are many smaller steps within the over-arching four steps outlined  above. Details on processes for doing this work can be found in Ebi et al.  (2004), Ohlson et al. (2005), and Evans et al. (2006). Doing vulnerability as- sessments and developing adaptation strategies is an iterative process, with  assessments and strategies being revisited as more knowledge becomes avail-    9  able. It is likely that a first run through the framework on an issue would be  done to identify information needs and refine the issue. The vulnerability and  adaptation steps would be cycled through a number of times before imple- mentation of an adaptation strategy.  Numerous adaptive actions proposed for forest and range management are  summarized by Spittlehouse and Stewart (2003). They can be grouped into  two categories: adaptation of forests and range to a changing climate, and so- cietal adaptation to the response of forests and range to the changing climate.  Adapting the forest includes species selection, tree breeding, stand manage- ment, and creating fire-smart landscapes. Societal adaptation includes  revising conservation objectives, changing expectations, developing policies  to encourage adaptation, adapting forest management techniques, changing  rotation age, using more salvage wood, and modifying wood processing tech- nology.   CHALLENGES TO ADAPTING TO CLIMATE CHANGE  Consideration of weather and climate conditions is part of forest and range  management. For example, fire protection activities include calculating  drought codes and developing fire-smart communities. Climate is implicitly  included in growth and yield modelling and ecosystem mapping. The chal- lenge is to develop explicit descriptors of species and ecosystem responses to  climate that can be used in vulnerability assessments and in developing adap- tation strategies (e.g., Wang et al. 2006b).    A major challenge in taking adaptive actions in the short term is the un- certainty in the magnitude and timing of future climate change. This  uncertainty is compounded by the uncertainty in the future markets for our  forest and range resources and the concern that climate change may lead to  relative increases in the timber and forest products supply from other nations  (Sohngen and Sedjo 2005). The development of adaptation measures for  some time in the future, under an uncertain climate, in an unknown socio- economic context is bound to be highly speculative (Burton et al. 2002).  Some groups may believe that responding is a greater risk than doing noth- ing, or that impacts can be dealt with only when they happen. Furthermore,  there is a lack of awareness in the forestry community of the risks of climate  change (Williamson et al. 2005), although this is changing.  The size of the forested land base in British Columbia means that much of  the forest will have to adjust without human intervention. Of the approxi- mately 60 Mha of forest in British Columbia there are about 35 Mha in the  non-timber harvest land base (including parks, wilderness areas, and areas  with operational constraints) where forest management consists mainly of  fire protection and conservation. The remaining 25 Mha, the timber harvest  land base, is harvested at about 0.2 Mha per year. Adaptation will likely focus  on the major commercial tree species and perhaps a few animal species,  while most forest and range plants and animals will have to adapt as best they  can. Any large-scale disturbances caused by climate change would be particu- larly difficult to address. In some areas, adaptation to reduce the vulnerability  of resources such as water quality and quantity and biological conservation  will become the highest priority.    0  There are institutional and policy barriers to responding to climate  change. For example, seed planning zones, reforestation standards, and hy- drologic and wildlife management guidelines are designed for the current  climate regime. There are no requirements for adaptation strategies in forest  management plans, nor are there guidelines and sufficient experienced per- sonnel to aid such activities. Also, it is often difficult to get the long-term  funding required to address such a wide-ranging issue as climate change.  Assessing vulnerabilities and developing adaptation strategies requires in- formation about possible future climates. At present, all of the future climate  scenarios should be considered to have equal likelihood of occurrence. The  next 20 years will see improvements in our knowledge of the future climate,  along with improved understanding of the vulnerability of forest and range  resources to climate change. We may need to apply interim responses, but  these actions must not have negative consequences if the future does not un- fold as assumed. Short-term actions include: forest policies to facilitate  adaptation, training to develop adaptive capacity in forest managers, and  doing vulnerability assessments.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS  The next 20 years will clarify the global response to the risks of climate  change. Global climate models will have improved, and we should have a  clearer idea of the climate change to expect. This period should also see sig- nificant improvements in our understanding of the vulnerability of forest and  range resources to climate change. In the meantime, it is recommended that:  • Vulnerability analyses use climate simulations for the B and A2 scenarios,  and simulations from at least two global climate models with different cli- matologies (e.g., the Canadian and Hadley Centre models).  • Analyses should use annual, as well as mean, data to evaluate the effects of  changes in the inter-annual variability, and the frequency and intensity of  extremes.  Although many of the impacts of climate change may be decades away,   assessing forest vulnerability to climate change, developing adaptation strate- gies, and strengthening monitoring programs should start now. Most of  British Columbia’s forests and range are on Crown land. The provincial gov- ernment is responsible for: developing management objectives; setting  standards for species selection, seed transfer, stocking, and biodiversity; allo- cating land to parks and wilderness areas; and maintaining health and  growth monitoring plots.  It is recommended that the B.C. Ministry of Forests and Range respond   to the potential impacts of climate change on forest and range management  by co-operating with other agencies and groups in taking the lead to:  • Develop databases and methods for assessing vulnerabilities to climate  change and promote adaptation in forest and range management.  • Create a set of climate-change scenarios for British Columbia at a high  spatial resolution so that all users can work from a common database.    • Provide a “one stop” facility that is a source of climate-change scenarios  and other climate data for vulnerability analyses, and facilitate access to  the latest information.  • Determine user needs with respect to climate variables, time periods, and  tools for climate-change vulnerability analyses.  • Develop adaptive capacity within the forest and range management com- munity.  • Develop a set of key indicators of climate change for monitoring the re- sponse of forest and range resources to climate change.  • Investigate management responses that can be applied in the short term to  alleviate some of the vulnerability without compromising the long term.  It is encouraging to note that current actions by the Ministry of Forest and  Range and the British Columbia provincial government are addressing many  of these recommendations. Recent announcements from the British Colum- bia provincial government setting emission reduction targets for British  Columbia are also welcomed.      2  LITERATURE CITED  AES. 993.

A dry, cold late-glacial climate was followed by a  period of rapid warming, a warm and dry interval, and then a warm and   relatively moist interval. Today’s relatively cool climate in British Columbia  began about 4500 years ago (Rosenberg et al. 2004). Most of the vegetation  regimes we are familiar with were established 4000–6000 years ago, although  there have been adjustments in ranges and species composition due to fluctu- ations in climate and human activity during this period.   The last 000 years in the Northern Hemisphere was a period of slow cool- ing of about 0.7°C, followed by a warming that started about 200 years ago  (Figure A). The rate of warming over the last 00 years has been faster than  any time in the past 2000 years. Temperatures are now as warm, if not warm- er, than any time in the past 2000 years and are about °C warmer than the  early 800s. The concentration of carbon dioxide has risen from 280 ppm be- fore the start of the Industrial Revolution to about 38 ppm and is currently  increasing at about .9 ppm per year (Canadell et al. 2007). Other greenhouse  gases such as methane have shown similar rates of increase. Concentrations  are greater than any seen in the last 650 000 years (Houghton et al. 200;  Hengeveld 2006; IPCC WG I 2007).   The temperature variation in British Columbia in the last 2000 years has,  in general, been similar to that of the Northern Hemisphere (Rosenberg et al.  2004; Hebda 2007). In the last 00 years there has been a tendency for a  greater warming in the winter than in the summer air temperature. The  warming has been greater in northern British Columbia than in southern    0 500 1000 1500 2000  Year (AD)  D ep  ar tu  re s   in  te  m p  er at  ur e   (° C)    fr  om  th  e  19  61 –1  99 0   av er  ag e 0.4  0  -0.4  -0.8  Figure A1   Variation in the annual Northern Hemisphere temperature over the last  2000 years expressed as the difference between the annual values and the  1961–1990 average.

Ministry of  Water, Land and Air Protection 2002; Vincent and Mekis 2006; Rodenhuis et  al. 2007; Pike et al. 2008a). There have been fewer cold nights, cold days, and  frost days and more warm nights and warm days. Similar conditions have  been found for most of southern Canada (Vincent and Mekis 2006). There is  insufficient coverage in the first half of the 900s to quantify changes in  northern Canada.  Trends in annual precipitation over the 20th century were positive but  spatially variable. Increases have occurred in winter and summer but have  been larger in the winter than in the summer in northern British Columbia  and larger in the summer in southern British Columbia (Figure A3). Over   the last 50 years there has been a reduction in winter precipitation and an    Winter  Summer  Spring  Fall Annual  -1.25 -1.00 -0.75 -0.50 -0.25 0.00 0.25 0.50 0.75 1.00 1.25 1.50 1.75 2.00 2.25 2.50 2.75 3.00  Winter  Summer  Spring  Fall Annual  -0.50 -0.25 0.00 0.25 0.50 0.75 1.00 1.25 1.50 1.75 2.00 2.25 2.50 2.75 3.00 3.25   Figure A2   Seasonal trends in (a) maximum and (b) minimum temperatures for western  Canada for 1900–2003 (Moore et al. 2008).

There has been an increase in the number   of days with precipitation and a decrease in the number of consecutive dry  days since early in the 900s. Woods et al. (2005) suggested that the recent  increase in wet and warm days has resulted in an increase in the occurrence   of a needle disease that kills lodgepole pine trees. Annual snowfall and snow- pack depth have declined substantially in the last 50 years (Mote et al. 2005;  Vincent and Mekis 2006). Similar conditions have been found for most of  southern Canada (Vincent and Mekis 2006). Trends in precipitation are   superimposed on large inter-annual and inter-decadal variations in precipita- tion that are affected by ocean conditions such as El Nino / La Nina events  and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (Rodenhuis et al. 2007; Moore et al 2008).

An example for carbon dioxide is  shown in Figure A4, and similar patterns occur for other greenhouse gases  such as methane, nitrous oxide, and dust particles. Canadell et al. (2007) re- port that current rates of emissions are now higher than those used in the  IPCC WG I (2007) analyses.  Future global  temperature and   precipitation regimes   The corresponding simulated global air temperatures for the two emission  scenarios in Figure A4 are shown in Figure  of the main body of this report.  All scenarios have a temperature increase with time, and the size of the  change increases towards the poles (Figure A5).   Changes in precipitation have a more variable pattern and there is a great- er range of variation between models and scenarios than there is with  temperature. Summer precipitation is predicted to decease in equatorial and  temperate latitudes but to increase in northern latitudes (Figure A6). In the  winter, the precipitation increase is greater than in summer and the increase  tends to extend into the northern temperate latitudes.  British Columbia’s  future temperature   and precipitation  regimes     The examples for British Columbia are based on Canadian global climate  model version 2 (CGCM2) for the A2 and B emission scenarios (Figure A4).  Data were downscaled using the ClimateBC software (Spittlehouse 2006;  Wang et al. 2006a). This method assumes that the relative geographical dis- tribution of temperature and precipitation will remain the same under   Figure A4   The B1 and A2 emissions scenarios for carbon dioxide used in global climate  modelling. Other greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide, and  particulates such as sulphur, follow a similar trend. The simulated global  mean air temperature for each scenario is shown in Figure 1.

Values are multi-model averages based  on the SRES A1B scenario for December to February (left), and June to August  (right). White areas are where less than 66% of the models agree in the sign  of the change and stippled areas are where more than 90% of the models  agree in the sign of the change.

The left panels show corresponding uncertainties as the  relative probabilities of estimated global average warming from several different Atmosphere-Ocean  Global Climate Models and Earth System Model of Intermediate Complexity studies for the same  periods. Some studies present results only for a subset of the SRES scenarios, or for various model  versions. Therefore the difference in the number of curves shown in the left-hand panels is due only  to differences in the availability of results.

The high resolution of the figures does not  imply a high accuracy, that being limited by the GCM data and the interpola- tion methodology. Wang et al. (2006a) reported an accuracy of ±°C for  temperature and ±5 mm for precipitation in a test against the 96–990 nor- mals. The grid-based data for monthly temperature and precipitation at   400 m spacing for current climate and the A2 scenario are available at:  ftp://ftp.for.gov.bc.ca/HRE/external/!publish/Climate/. ClimateBC software  and a web-based version are available at http://genetics.forestry.ubc.ca/cfgc/ climate-models.html .  Mean annual temperature and precipitation data for 96–990 and for  2020s, 2050s, and 2080s for the A2 scenario were presented in the main part  of the report (Figures 2 and 3). This Appendix focuses on seasonal changes in  temperature and precipitation for the A2 emissions scenario (Figures A7 and  A8) and presents data for specific locations in British Columbia (Tables A2  and A3) for the A2 and B emissions scenarios.

Climate in 2080s for B is similar to that for A2 in   2050s (Tables A2 and A3). In both scenarios, the temperature increases with  time. There is a tendency for the warming to be greatest in northern British  Columbia and larger in the winter than in the summer. The warming is great- er in the winter minimum temperature than in the winter maximum  temperature, with warming in winter greater than summer. For example, for  Cranbook by 2080 under the A2 scenario winter minimum rises by 7°C, win- ter maximum by 3°C, summer minimum by 4°C, and summer maximum by  3.5°C. The respective values for Fort Nelson of 9, 6, 4.5, and 3.5°C, show the  greater warming in northern British Columbia. Warming is least in coastal  areas where it is moderated by the ocean. Increasing temperature is accompa- nied by an increase in the frost-free period and growing degree-days.

Southern  and central British Columbia are predicted to get drier in the summer, while  northern British Columbia is more likely to be wetter (Figure A8), although  the change in volume is not large. Winters will be wetter across British Co- lumbia, with a greater percentage increase in the north, though coastal  British Columbia sees the greatest volume increase in winter precipitation  (Tables A2 and A3). Warming means that less of the precipitation will fall as  snow. For example, at Cranbrook there is a reduction from 20 mm to 70 mm  (water equivalent) of the winter precipitation as snow by 2080s under the A2  scenario. At Fort Nelson the change is from 30 mm to 5 mm.   Influence of climate  change on snow   accumulation and  melt     Mote et al. (2005) and Rodenhuis et al. (2007) report a general decline in  snowpacks over much of western North America in the last 50 years. Increas- ing winter temperatures under climate change are expected to continue this  trend. This is illustrated (Figure A9) with data for the Upper Penticton Creek  Experimental Watershed on the Okanagan Plateau (Winkler et al. 2004) for  climate conditions equivalent to the CGCM2 A2 scenario in 2050s and 2080s.  A snow accumulation and melt model was used to determine the daily snow  depth under a forest canopy for winter 200/02. The effect of a changing cli- mate was evaluated by modelling the response to 2 and 4ºC increases in the  200/02 daily temperatures. A third simulation involved a 4ºC increase in  temperature plus a 0% increase in winter precipitation. Winter precipitation  in 200/02 and snow on the ground at the end of March and April were  slightly below the 5-year average for Upper Penticton Creek.   A 2ºC warming early in winter did not affect the snow accumulation   (Figure A9) because conditions still remained cold enough for precipitation  to fall mainly as snow. There was also minimal snowmelt.

The scenarios are: 2°C  warming (increase to daily temperature record for winter 2001/02) with  no precipitation change (purple line), 4°C warming with no change  in precipitation (green line), and 4°C warming with a 10% increase in  precipitation (orange line).     32  winter, conditions had warmed sufficiently that snowmelt could start earlier  than under the current climates, the maximum snowpack depth was reduced  by about 30% and it disappeared about 2 weeks earlier than under current  conditions. A 4ºC warming was large enough that early snow accumulation  was reduced resulting in a reduction in peak snow depth by 50% (Figure A9).  The warming also resulted in snowmelt occurring earlier in the year and the  snowpack disappearing about a month earlier than under current conditions.  Increasing precipitation only slightly offset the effect of a 4ºC temperature in- crease.  Influence of  climate change on   evaporative demand  and climatic moisture   deficit     Estimates of the evaporative demand for water and measurements of precipi- tation can be combined to give indicators of plant water stress and to predict  water demand for agricultural irrigation and domestic use. A climatic mois- ture deficit occurs if the monthly precipitation is less than the monthly  evaporative demand. If precipitation is greater than the evaporative demand   there is a moisture surplus. Monthly evaporative demand was calculated fol- lowing Allen et al. (998) for months when the air temperature was above  0°C. The analysis was done with the 96–990 normals and 2080s’ CGCM2  B and A2 climate scenarios for the Campbell River, Cranbrook, and Fort St.  John areas. Temperature and precipitation data at 2080 were obtained from  ClimateBC (Spittlehouse 2006; Wang et al. 2006a). The average monthly sun- shine or solar radiation data and a mean wind speed for the 96–990 period  (AES 993) were used for the 2080s calculations.   Evaporative demand increased at all locations due to an increase in the  length of time the air temperature was above zero and to an increase in the  vapour pressure deficit. This result is consistent with the assessment of Hun- tington (2008). Under the B scenario, by 2080s the demand    increased by   about 8% while under the A2 scenario, with greater warming, it increased by  5–20%. There was a greater difference between locations in the climatic  moisture deficit, reflecting the balance between changes in temperature and  changes in precipitation (Figures A7 and A8).  By 2080s under the B scena- rio, the deficit at Campbell River increased by 20%, at Fort St. John by 25%,  and at Cranbrook by 30%. For the A2 scenario, Campbell River and Fort St.  John increased by 30%, while Cranbrook increased by 60%. The larger in- crease at Cranbook reflects the decrease in summer rainfall and an initially  relatively low average deficit for 96–990. A moisture surplus did not occur  during the summer at any of the locations. A comprehensive analysis should  assess the inter-annual variability in evaporative demand and climatic mois- ture deficit under a changing climate.    33  APPENDIX 3  Potential impacts of climate change on British Columbia’s forest and  range resources  The response of forest and range species to climate change and the changing  operating environment will challenge our ability to use forest and range re- sources. The wood supply for the next 50–00 years in most of British  Columbia is already “in the ground” or will be planted in the next few years  with minimal consideration about climate change. Losses in productivity of  natural and planted stands are expected to occur in the drier and warmer re- gions of British Columbia, while modest increases are anticipated in the short  to mid term in the north (Rehfeldt et al. 999, 200; Spittlehouse 2003; John- son and Williamson 2005). These changes will affect rotation age, wood  quality, wood volume, and size of logs. An increase in disturbance by fire, in- sects, and disease could lead to a greater amount of the harvest consisting of  salvaged wood (Spittlehouse and Stewart 2003; Volney and Hirsch 2005).  Technological change, trade disputes, changes in exchange and interest rates  and changes in consumer tastes and preferences will take place along with  climate change. Countries that are expected to be significant beneficiaries of  climate change from a production standpoint (e.g., in South America and  Oceania) are already replacing Canadian products in the global market  (Sohngen and Sedjo 2005).    Access to timber and harvest scheduling will change because warmer and/ or wetter winters will limit site access for winter logging, and warmer and  drier summers will reduce access due to increased fire risk. Expected higher  rainfall intensities and a reduction in the return period of high-intensity rains  will affect road design and maintenance (Spittlehouse and Stewart 2003).  More severe winter storm events in coastal British Columbia are likely to in- crease the probability of landslides, including debris flows (Wieczorek and  Glade 2005; Pike et al. 2008b). This has implications for forest development  planning and operations. Increase in warming in the north and an accompa- nying increase in permafrost melt will increase the risk of landslides  (Geerstma et al. 2006).  Reforestation is based on the selection of species and genotypes that are  genetically adapted to the site (climate and soil). A changing climate means  that the appropriate plants for a site would change (Rehfeldt et al. 999, 200;  Parker et al. 2000; Spittlehouse 996; Spittlehouse and Stewart 2003; Wang et  al. 2006b). Hamann and Wang (2006) indicate that tree species with their  northern range limit in British Columbia could gain climatically suitable ha- bitat at a pace of about 00 km per decade. Common hardwoods appear to be  less sensitive to climate change, while some of the most important conifer  species in British Columbia could lose a large portion of their climatically  suitable habitat. Similar results were obtained for the western United States  by Rehfeldt et al. (2006). The climate will continue to change over the life of  the stand and we must decide which climate regime the planting stock should  be selected to meet. Increased competition from species more suited to this  climate means that there may be a need to increase stand management activi- ties in established stands (Parker et al. 2000; Spittlehouse and Stewart 2003).   Future disturbances by fire, insects and disease will have a large influence  on the future forest carbon balance. The effect will be greater than the effects  of changes in tree species occurrence and growth rates (Kurz et al. 2007,     34  2008a, b). Recent forest fires and insect attacks have resulted in a negative  carbon balance for Canada’s managed-forest, and a much reduced positive  balance for British Columbia’s forests (Kurz et al. 2008a, b). In some areas of  British Columbia, the distribution of ages of the trees is biased towards old  trees. The resultant build-up of fuels for fire and an increase in the susceptibi- lity of trees to diseases and pests increases the risk of disturbance. Increase in  disturbance will lead to an increase in the area of younger forests, which  along with changes in forest growth and species composition will affect habi- tat quality and availability for wildlife (Harding and McCullum 997; Stenseth  et al. 2002). Changes in fire regime will also have a direct impact on the sa- fety of people and property (Volney and Hirsch 2005), as illustrated by the  fires near Kelowna and Barriere in 2003. Smoke from forest fires can have  health impacts many kilometres from the fire.   Increased occurrence of wildfires would increase the likelihood of post- wildfire flood and landslide risks to human life, property, and infrastructure.  Forest harvesting and road building may have to increase efforts to mitigate  the impacts of changes in the timing of peak flow and volume in streams on  infrastructure, fish habitat, and potable water supplies (Mote et al. 2003; Pike  et al. 2008b). Warmer and drier summer conditions will increase the pressure  to maintain cool stream temperatures by maintaining riparian cover in har- vested areas (Moore et al. 2005). A priority may be placed on preserving  habitat for conservation.  However, the values and attributes that parks and  wilderness areas were designed to protect may no longer exist within the pro- tected areas under a changed climate (Scott and Lemieux 2005). Warmer  winters will shorten the winter recreational season while the summer recrea- tional season will increase, although increased fire risk may limit this  increase. Increases in disturbance by fire may favour certain mushrooms and  berry-producing shrubs (Spittlehouse 2005).  Some specific implications of climate change for British Columbia’s eco- systems are:  • Coastal forests: In the southern part of the area, warmer and drier late  spring and summers could increase fire risk and decrease water availabili- ty. Increased water stress will affect species such as western redcedar on  marginal sites on the east side of Vancouver Island.  The wet, cool mid and  north coasts will likely see an improvement in growing conditions. In- crease in storm number and intensity will likely increase windthrow and  breakage of trees. An increase in the severity of storms could increase the  probability of landslides and debris flows.  • Lower elevations in southern interior: Drier sites may experience regener- ation problems due to an increase in summer droughts. Grasslands are  expected to expand and the current encroachment of forests on grasslands  may be reversed by climate change. The range of invasive species may also  expand.  • Higher elevations in southern interior: A shorter snow season and in- creased length of growing season may initially be beneficial to regenera-  tion and growth. In drier areas, reduction in summer precipitation and  increase in temperature will increase the risk of fires and drought stress.  • Northern interior: Warming and only small changes in summer precipita- tion have the potential to result in increased tree growth in the short to  mid term. A shorter winter season will reduce access to sensitive terrain.    35  • Alpine: The length of the snowpack season, soil conditions, and slow   regeneration rates will limit the rate of forest encroachment. Artificial  warming studies in tundra ecosystems have shown changes in the occur- rence of existing species.  Assessment of  the implications   of a changing  climate change on   ecosystems     The high spatial resolution climate data (e.g., Figures 2 and 3 and Appendix  2) can be used in detailed assessments of climate-change impacts on forest  and range resources. The climate data were combined with a spatial distribu- tion of British Columbia’s ecosystem units to determine the realized climate  space (characteristic values) of these units (Hamann and Wang 2006). Under  the A2 scenario, substantial shifts in climate zones could occur by the 2080s.   The drier and warmer climate produced by the Hadley model produced a  further northward movement of zone climates. The B emissions scenario  would produce a zone climate map for 2080s similar to that of the A2 in  2050s. This work is a preliminary assessment and the analysis needs to incor- porate climate data from Alberta and the northwestern United States to  determine if analogues of climates of these areas may develop.  Another approach to assessing vulnerability of ecosystems is to evaluate  possible impacts of a changing climate at a location. In this approach, ecosys- tem maps are overlain on grid-based climate data from ClimateBC to obtain  descriptions of the climate of these units for current conditions (Table A)  and under various climate scenarios. The example presented here (Table  A4) is based on the A2 scenario in 2050 (Spittlehouse 2006). The very dry  maritime Coastal Western Hemlock (CWHxm2) is on the eastern slope of  the Vancouver Island Mountains. The wet cool Sub-Boreal Spruce (SBSwk)  is in the central interior of British Columbia on the west side of the Quesnel  Highlands and on the MacGregor Plateau. Climate varies within a unit but  the climate-change scenario shifts all values of a variable by about the same  amount, so the standard deviation on the means stays the same. Both units  are warmer by about 2°C and wetter in the winter. The CWHmx2 has less  rain in the summer, while there is a slight increase in summer rainfall for the  SBSwk. The CWHxm2 climate changes towards that of the coastal plain on  the east coast of the island. The implications for tree growth are that Douglas- fir should continue to grow well but western redcedar could disappear from  currently marginal sites. The SBSwk climate is moving towards that of some  units of the Interior Cedar-Hemlock zone. Warming of this unit may favour  the growth of interior Douglas-fir and lodgepole pine over spruce.     36  Table A4   The 1961–1990 normals and possible future climate (CGCM2-A2x scenario) of two biogeoclimatic ecosystem  units for 2050s.

The Ministry of Forests and Range (MoFR) is developing an adaptation  strategy in response to the threat of climate change for British Columbia’s for- est and range resources. The first iteration of the Ministry’s response can be  placed in the framework as follows:  • Issue: Climate change will play a major role in shaping the future compo- sition and use of forest and range resources in British Columbia.  • Vulnerability assessment: Climate-change impacts are poorly known.  There is a lack of awareness of the issue within the forest and range com- munity. Some of the vulnerability may not be related to climate change.  Changing social and economic conditions are influencing forest and range  resource utilization. There is a lack of research knowledge and policies to  enable adequate response to these vulnerabilities.  • Adaptation strategy:  The MoFR established a Climate Change Task Team  to review potential impacts of climate change on provincial forest and  range resources, identify knowledge gaps, and develop recommendations  on how the MoFR should proceed. The Future Forest Ecosystems Initiative  (FFEI) was launched to consult with a wide cross-section of society in  British Columbia on the future threats to the province’s forest and range  resources and possible responses. Although it will be some years before  operational adaptation actions are implemented, consultation, capacity  building, and vulnerability assessments are viewed as important first steps  in the adaptation process.   • Implementing the adaptation strategy: Recommendations from the Task  Team were released in a report (B.C. Ministry of Forests and Range 2006).  The MoFR consulted widely on the reports of the Task Team and the FFEI.  The recommendations from these reports and the consultations were  amalgamated under the goal of adapting British Columbia’s forest and  range management framework to changing climatic conditions. The FFEI  is ongoing and has become part of the MoFR business plan.  The forest genetics research community is a leader in forestry in assessing  vulnerability and developing adaptation strategies to respond to climate  change. Examples can be found in Rehfeldt et al. (999, 200, 2006), Hamann  and Wang (2006), and Wang et al. (2006b), and are used here to illustrate ap- plication of the framework at a provincial scale.   • Issue: Forest policies on the use of seed for reforestation are designed to  minimize the risk of maladaptation. Thus there is a requirement to use  “local” seed under the assumption that local seed is best adapted to the  local climate. Under climate change, this assumption may be invalid with- in the next 50 years. This is a province-wide issue for all commercial  species of trees.   • Vulnerability assessment: The risk is that by 2080 the climate will have  changed such that trees growing from the “local” seed may be in condi-    38  tions well outside their envelopes for optimum survival and growth. Seed  planning units are geographically based and only implicitly account for  climatic conditions. Consequently, under a changing climate these man- agement units may not be appropriate for managing seed selection (Wang  et al. 2006b).   • Adaptation strategy: Determine the climates of the sources of seed used  for reforestation. Develop response functions of various seed sources to a  wide range of climatic conditions using provenance trials. Determine the  patterns in growth response to climate among populations. Predict im- pacts of climate changes on productivity with different seed deployment  strategies. Develop climate-based seed planning units.  • Implementating the adaptation strategy: Development of a high spatial  resolution climate database is facilitating determining the climate of seed  sources and the trial sites (e.g., Hamann and Wang 2006; Wang et al.  2006a,b). Plans are in place to increase the number of provenance trials  for commercial tree species and to establish them over a wide climatic  range.
