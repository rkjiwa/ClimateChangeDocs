We can protect ourselves from these  impacts by implementing cleaner and more efficient energy  strategies and by preparing more effectively for future  climate and health disasters.3 We must also ensure that  communities and health departments have the resources  they need to deal with present-day health threats.4   CALIFORNIA’S FIRE SEASON IS GETTING LONGER   AND MORE DANGEROUS Climate change and expanding urban development in fire- prone areas are putting more Californians in the path of  dangerous wildfires over longer periods of the year.5 The  relationship between climate trends and wildfire has not  been uniform across California’s many different habitats  and climate zones, and projections of the future number  and extent of fires are uncertain.6 Broadly speaking,  however, high temperatures and more severe droughts in  the western United States reduce water availability and  dry out vegetation.7 These conditions create more days  with extreme fire weather and can fuel larger wildfires.  For example, in 2017, the combination of extremely high  temperatures from May through September and delayed  autumn rainfall contributed to the severity of that year’s  fire season.8 The run up to the Camp Fire was also hot and  dry, with below average precipitation and above average  temperatures from June through November 2018.9  These conditions are making California wildfire seasons  worse. Four of California’s worst fires on record occurred  between October 2017 and November 2018 alone. The  Camp Fire (November 2018) was the deadliest and the most  destructive in terms of structures lost in state history,  and the Tubbs Fire (October 2017) was the second most  destructive.10 The Mendocino Complex (July 2018) was  the largest in terms of area burned, and the Thomas Fire  (December 2017) the second largest.11 California wildfires  killed at least 46 people in 2017 and at least 105 people in  2018, primarily in the Paradise area burned by the Camp  Fire.12 Many of those who died in the Camp Fire were elderly  or had a disability or illness that prevented or dissuaded  them from evacuating ahead of the fire.13  Wildfires create health risks that extend well beyond the  direct path of the burn zone. Wildfire smoke contains  contaminants, including fine particulate matter (i.e., soot).  These contaminants can degrade air quality hundreds  and even thousands of miles away from an actual fire.14  For instance, smoke from the Camp Fire in 2018 choked  northern California for 11 days, closing schools, leading  to shortages of protective face masks, and prompting  emergency measures by San Francisco city officials to  protect homeless people from 24-hour smoke exposure.15  However, the full health toll of the extraordinary smoke  from the Camp Fire remains unclear. As one health  researcher at University of California Davis put it: “This is  something we’ve never seen before. This is unprecedented  in the Bay Area. We really don’t know how to respond.”16  Exposure to wildfire smoke has been linked to health  problems such as respiratory infections, cardiac arrests,  low birth weight, mental health conditions, and exacerbated  asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.17 Long- term exposure to wildfire smoke generated an estimated  $76 billion to $136 billion per year in health costs across the  continuous United States from 2008 to 2012, with some of  the most significant impacts in northern California.18   Small particles from wildfires are a particular threat to  adults aged 65 and older, who made up nearly 14 percent  of California’s population in 2017.19 During the severe 2015  California fire season, researchers found a 22 percent  increase in risk of coronary artery disease and a 42 percent  increase in risk of heart attacks one day after exposure  to dense smoke among adults aged 65 or over.20 A study  from 2004 to 2009 analyzing the number of hospital  admissions for respiratory conditions among Medicare  recipients in the western United States found about 7  percent more admissions on smoke-wave days (days with  high concentrations of particle pollution) compared to non- smoke-wave days.21   California is experiencing a housing shortage, both in  large cities such as San Francisco where housing costs  have skyrocketed, and in less populated surrounding  regions.22 The state is among the worst-ranked states in  the nation for homeownership rates, housing cost burdens,  and severe home overcrowding.23 Destructive wildfires  have exacerbated this problem, making it impossible for  some individuals and families to find affordable housing  in an already tight market.24 This has increased the threat  of homelessness and disrupted community and family  networks that can help people bounce back from disasters.25   Damage to homes, forced relocation, missed work time, and  the loss of loved ones can lead to severe stress, depression,  and unhealthy coping behaviors like drug use.26 Anyone can   ©  N  oah B erger/A  ssociated Press    Page 3    NRDCCLIMATE CHANGE AND HEALTH IN CALIFORNIA   experience short-term mental health issues from wildfires,  but children, economically-disadvantaged people, and  people who already live with mental illness are especially  sensitive.27 For instance, the October 2007 wildfires in San  Diego destroyed or damaged 1,350 homes and forced more  than half a million people to evacuate.28 A survey of public  mental health clinics in early November 2007 found that  about 18 percent of clients who evacuated sought increased  levels of mental health assistance after the fires, compared  to about 2 percent in non-evacuation areas.29 In wake of the  Camp Fire in late 2018, school and health officials in Butte  County were particularly worried about the mental health of  children, many of whom had lost their homes and had gone  nearly four weeks without the normalcy of school.30   More severe fire seasons may also increase mental health  problems among first responders, who tend to have a high  prevalence of mental health conditions such as anxiety,  post-traumatic stress disorder, and sleep disturbances.31  Nationally, wildland firefighters already seem to be at  greater risk for suicide than non-wildland firefighters. As  wildfire season grows longer, the mental, physical, and  emotional demands placed on firefighters and other first  responders will only increase, leading to adverse health  outcomes for this crucial population.32  CLIMATE CHANGE WILL WORSEN CALIFORNIA’S   SMOG PROBLEM  California doesn’t just face a smokier future under climate  change; it also faces a smoggier one. Despite improvements  in the state’s air quality since the early 1990s, 34 California  counties, home to 33.8 million people, experience at  least one unhealthy ozone pollution (i.e., smog) day per  year (Figure 1).33 More than one-third of those counties  experience at least 16 unhealthy smog days per year.34  Eleven of the nation’s 25 smoggiest cities from 2014 to 2016  were in California, with Los Angeles topping the list.35   Unfortunately, climate change is likely to make the current  air quality problem worse and undermine the state’s future  progress toward cleaner air.36 Rising temperatures speed  up smog-forming chemical reactions between sunlight and  pollution from sources such as power plants.37   In 2014, about 5.2 million Californians had asthma, a  chronic lung disease that is triggered by smog.38 One study  of 3.7 million emergency room visits in California from  2005 to 2008 found that even small increases in smog  pollution significantly increased the number of visits for  asthma.39 African-American, American Indian/Alaskan  Native, and Puerto Rican Californians are between 28.6 and  132.5 percent more likely to be diagnosed with asthma than  white Californians, leaving these populations particularly  sensitive to smog.40 This disparity in asthma prevalence may  be due in part to diet, poorer quality housing, and higher  exposure to air pollution.41 Smog has also been linked to  other health problems, including reduced lung function,  cardiac arrest, and cognitive decline.42   Source: NRDC 2017.43  AVERAGE ANNUAL   OZONE EXCEEDANCE   DAYS (2011–2015) n ≥ 16 n 6-15 n 1-5   0 n  No monitors/insufficient data  FIGURE 1: CALIFORNIA COUNTIES AVERAGING ONE OR MORE   UNHEALTHY GROUND-LEVEL OZONE DAYS PER YEAR, 2011–2015  Ozone exceedances are days when an eight-hour average concentration of ozone  exceeds the EPA’s 2015 Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard of 0.070  parts per million.     Page 4    NRDCCLIMATE CHANGE AND HEALTH IN CALIFORNIA   EXTREME HEAT IS BAD FOR CALIFORNIANS’ HEALTH—  AND COULD BECOME DEADLIER California summers are already dangerously hot, and they  could become even more extreme in just a few decades.  Since 1895, average annual temperatures in California have  climbed 2.2 degrees Fahrenheit, and July 2018 was the  state’s hottest month on record.44 The warming trend is  accelerating: average summer temperatures in California  rose over three times faster from 1975 to the present  than from 1895 to the present (Figure 2).45 More than 31.8  million (or 83 percent of) Californians lived in counties  that experienced between 9.6 and 22.2 extreme heat days  per summer from 2007 to 2016 (Figure 3).46 In July 2018,  record-breaking heat and the resulting demand for air- conditioning led to power outages for more than 90,000  customers in the Los Angeles area.47 At least 990 residents  went without electricity for more than three days while  maximum daytime temperatures in downtown Los Angeles  exceeded 96 degrees Fahrenheit.48  If we don’t drastically cut global carbon emissions,  the number of extreme heat days will continue to rise.  Sacramento, for example, could see 24 days per year above  103.9 degrees Fahrenheit by the 2070s, compared to 4 days  per year from 1961 to 1990.49  Heat already poses a range of threats to California  residents, from minor illnesses like heat cramps to  potentially deadly conditions such as heatstroke or heat- related heart attacks.51 During the 2006 California heat  wave, Sacramento, Modesto, and Woodland Hills broke  records for the longest stretch of days over 100 degrees  Fahrenheit. Six locations also set new records for all-time  highest temperatures. Woodland Hills, for instance, hit 119  degrees Fahrenheit on July 22, 2006, exceeding its 1985  record by 3 degrees.52 Over the entire heat wave, there  were approximately 655 premature deaths, more than 1,600  excess hospitalizations, and more than 16,000 excess visits  to emergency rooms statewide related to the heat.53 In total,  the heat wave generated more than $5.3 billion in health  costs.54   Anyone can get sick from extreme heat, but young children,  older adults, people experiencing poverty, people with  chronic diseases like diabetes, homeless people, and  outdoor workers are particularly vulnerable.55 For instance,  one California study found that with every increase of  10 degrees Fahrenheit in daily apparent temperature (a  measure combining heat and humidity), emergency room  visits for mental health issues increased by nearly 5 percent  across all ages. In addition, visits for self-injury or suicide  increased by 6 percent.56 During higher temperatures,  children aged 6 through 18 specifically had a 72 percent  greater increase in risk of negative mental health outcomes  than adults.57   Heat vulnerabilities associated with age, occupation, and  socioeconomic factors are especially pronounced in cities  due to the urban heat island effect, which is produced by  tall buildings that block airflow, an abundance of heat- absorbing surfaces like asphalt, and a lack of tree cover and  other green space.58 During summers, most of California’s  larger cities are up to 9 degrees Fahrenheit warmer on  average than surrounding suburban and rural areas.59 In the  Riverside-San Bernardino area, where multiple heat islands  form an “urban heat archipelago,” there can be a difference  of up to 19 degrees Fahrenheit in average temperatures  between urban and non-urban areas.60  FIGURE 2: AVERAGE JUNE–AUGUST TEMPERATURES IN CALIFORNIA, 1895–2018AVERAGE JUNE–AUGUST TEMPERATURES IN CALIFORNIA, 1895–2018  1895 1915 1935 1955 1975 1995 2015  AV ER  AG E J  UN -A  UG  T  EM PE  RA TU  RE  (°  F)  YEAR 1895 1915 1935 1955 1975 1995 2015  YEAR  77  76  75  74  73  72  71  70  69 AV ER  AG E J  UN -A  UG  T  EM PE  RA TU  RE  (°  F)  77  76  75  74  73  72  71  70  69   1895–2018 TREND (+2.1 degrees per century) 1975–2018 TREND (+7.5 degrees per century)  Source: NOAA.50    Page 5    NRDCCLIMATE CHANGE AND HEALTH IN CALIFORNIA   Source: NRDC.61  Low-income households and communities of color are often  concentrated in the hottest urban neighborhoods.62 A 2010  study analyzed areas in Los Angeles with little plant cover,  a high density of urban development, and high land surface  temperatures. The research found those areas tended to  have more people of color, more disabled people, fewer high  school graduates, fewer owner-occupied homes, and lower  household incomes.63   Low-income households may be unable to afford life-saving  air-conditioning; they also may lack access to cooling  centers.64 In 2015, just nine of Los Angeles County’s 94  official cooling centers were located in the most heat- vulnerable census tracts. These areas had high percentages  of renters, foreign-born residents, people below the  poverty level, and households with no vehicles and no  health insurance.65 In San Diego County, from 1999 to 2013,  people from households in ZIP codes where central air-  conditioning is uncommon were hospitalized significantly  more often for heat-related causes on days with a  maximum temperature of 89 degrees Fahrenheit or higher,  compared to days cooler than 75 degrees Fahrenheit.66  Hospitalizations did not significantly increase on hot days in  ZIP codes with high ownership of air-conditioning.67   In early 2017, a quarter of the nation’s homeless population  lived in California and 68 percent of homeless people in the  state lived on the street, with no refuge from extreme heat.68  African-Americans comprised nearly one-third of the state’s  unsheltered people in 2017.69 Homeless people also are more  likely to have high rates of chronic disease, mental health  conditions, and drug and alcohol dependencies—all of which  can increase sensitivity to extreme heat.70   California’s estimated 423,700 farmworkers and 854,000  construction workers are especially vulnerable to heat- related illnesses and death.71 From 2000 to 2010, the risk  of heat-related deaths was 35 times higher among U.S.  farmworkers and 13 times higher among construction  workers than workers in other industries.72 Researchers  in Los Angeles found that from 2005 to 2010, there was an  estimated 8 to 11 percent increase in heat-related emergency  room visits for every 1 percent increase in the number  of residents working in agriculture, forestry, fishing and  hunting, and mining.73 Foreign-born farmworkers, who make  up about 90 percent of California’s agricultural workforce,  may be particularly at risk for heat-related illnesses on the  job. Language barriers or concerns about their immigration  status could potentially hinder their access to heat- safety information and their willingness to report illness  to employers or submit workplace safety complaints to  California’s Division of Occupational Safety and Health.74  Furthermore, many foreign-born farmworkers are paid by  the amount they harvest, which can dissuade them from  taking breaks for shade or water.75 As one worker said in  a 2013 focus group, “Yes, we continue working because we  want to advance to earn what we are supposed to for the  day … we have to continue working, until we can’t handle it  anymore.”76   SEVERE DROUGHTS THREATEN FOOD AND WATER SECURITY  IN RURAL CALIFORNIA  From late 2011 to early 2017, California endured its worst  drought in at least 1,200 years.77 The drought caused   $5 billion or more in damage to the state’s agriculture  industry and affected water supplies, fisheries, and  infrastructure.78 In 2015, spring and summer runoff was  at less than half of normal values at 14 points on major  Central Valley rivers. And from spring 2011 to spring  2016, groundwater levels at nearly half of California wells  declined by more than 10 feet.79  There is increasing evidence that record-high temperatures  in 2014, 2015, and 2016 contributed to the historic  drought.80 First, extreme heat increased water loss   FIGURE 3: AVERAGE NUMBER OF EXTREME SUMMER HEAT DAYS   EACH YEAR IN CALIFORNIA COUNTIES, 2007-2016  “Extreme heat days” are defined here as days from June 1 to August 31 on which  the maximum temperature at a given station was as hot as (or hotter than) the top  10 percent of maximum readings at that station from 1961 to 1990. We used the  June, July, and August days from 1961 to 1990 to calculate the top 10 percent of  temperature readings. Nine of these extreme heat days per summer, on average,  would be expected if temperatures remain stable. County-level values represent  the average of station-level data within a given county.

Groundwater withdrawals  by industrial farming operations exacerbated decades-old  pollution problems by decreasing the volume of well water,  thus increasing the concentration of nitrates and arsenic.91  Nitrate contamination, which in rural areas largely comes  from fertilizers and animal feedlots, can be deadly to  infants.92 Researchers have linked arsenic exposure to  chronic illnesses including diabetes and multiple forms of  cancer.93   Finally, the drought made it hard for the poorest residents  of the San Joaquin Valley to get enough food. In 2016,  13.4 percent of people (61,452 individuals) in the San  Joaquin Valley’s nine counties experienced food insecurity,  compared to 11.7 percent of California as a whole.94 In 2015  alone, there were more than 10,000 seasonal farm jobs  lost across California.95 The combination of seasonal job  losses and rising household water bills during the drought  increased food bank usage by farming families.96 One food  bank in Tulare County, for example, served 5,000 more  people in May 2014 than in typical months.97 A resident  of Cantua Creek, in Fresno County, said at a community  meeting, “We have to decide now if we bathe with water or  if we eat!”98  ©  Lucy N  icholson/R euters    Page 7    NRDCCLIMATE CHANGE AND HEALTH IN CALIFORNIA   SOUTHERN CALIFORNIANS FACE MORE VALLEY FEVER   UNDER CLIMATE CHANGE In Southern California, increases in temperature and  changes in rainfall patterns fueled by climate change may  be contributing to more cases of Valley fever.99 Valley  fever is an airborne fungal infection that can cause fatigue,  shortness of breath, and, in rare cases, serious infections of  the lungs, brain, skin, or bones.100 Approximately 40 percent  of people infected with Valley fever need hospitalization.101  California accounted for about 45 percent of the 11,829  cases of Valley fever across the United States in 2016.102  The number of Valley fever cases increased about fivefold  from 1998 to 2016 in California and four other southwestern  states.103  Additionally, Valley fever can worsen asthma symptoms,  leading to more medication and trips to the doctor.104 The  San Joaquin Valley is a hotspot in California for both  asthma and Valley fever.105 Fifty-seven percent of the state’s  Valley fever cases from 2000 to 2015 were in the San  Joaquin Valley, and 11.4 percent of adults in the San Joaquin  Valley had active asthma in 2015 and 2016, compared to   8.3 percent of adults across the state.106   Construction workers, military personnel, oil and gas  workers, and others who use heavy machinery outdoors  are also vulnerable to Valley fever, because the fungus that  causes the infection lives in soil.107 Occupational exposures  accounted for more than half of the Valley fever cases  during 47 worldwide outbreaks from 1940 to 2015.108   STORMS AND SEA LEVEL RISE THREATEN CALIFORNIA’S  DRINKING WATER AND COULD DISRUPT TRANSIT AND  EMERGENCY SERVICES  Coastal California, which is home to more than 70 percent  of California residents, faces significant risks from the  combination of rising sea levels and more damaging  rainstorms.109   The average sea level at San Francisco’s tide gauge has  increased by about 7 inches since 1900, consistent with the  global average of 7 to 8 inches since 1890.110 In Northern  California’s Humboldt Bay, the relative sea level rise is more  than double the global rate.111 That’s because dikes have  long prevented natural land-building processes in what  used to be tidal wetlands, leading to local land settling and  sinking.112  As a result, parts of California are experiencing an increase  in the number of high tide floods (also called “nuisance”  or “sunny day” floods) that can block roads and damage  infrastructure.113 From 2000 to 2015, San Diego, La Jolla,  Los Angeles, and Humboldt Bay saw a 25 to 50 percent  increase in high tide floods. San Diego had 13 high tide  flood days in 2017, a new record for the city.114 Under an  intermediate sea level rise scenario (about 3 feet by 2100),  the coast from Arena Cove in Mendocino County to San  Diego could see high tide flooding increase from an average  of 1.4 days per year in 2015 to 35 days per year in 2050.115   ©  M  ichael O w  en B aker/A  ssociated Press    Page 8    NRDCCLIMATE CHANGE AND HEALTH IN CALIFORNIA   California also faces a future of stronger rainstorms like  the series of severe storms that hammered the state from  November 2016 through March 2017.116 If high levels  of global carbon emissions continue, the frequency of  extremely wet winter/spring seasons along California’s  coast could increase by an estimated 150 percent by the  2070s, compared to 1850.117 From 2018 to 2060, San  Francisco and Los Angeles may even face at least one wet  season similar to the devastating winter of 1861 to 1862,  in which 45 days of rain forced the temporary relocation  of the state legislature from Sacramento to San Francisco  and “destroyed almost one-third of the taxable land of  California.”118  Sea level rise and more frequent storms could lead to more  contaminated runoff and more failures of wastewater  treatment facilities along California’s coast.119 Wastewater  treatment plant failures can lead to outbreaks of  gastrointestinal infections such as norovirus, crypto, and  giardia.120 One foot of sea level rise beyond 1988 levels  could flood eight wastewater treatment plants that serve  more than 1 million Californians.121 Six feet of sea level rise  could flood 36 plants serving nearly 5.6 million people.  Thirty of those vulnerable wastewater treatment plants  are in the San Francisco Bay area.122 In small communities  like Marin County’s Stinson Beach, sea level rise will  push groundwater and waste from septic fields upward  into yards, streets, and homes.123 Groundwater flooding  associated with 3 feet of sea level rise could inundate about  11 percent of Stinson Beach.124  San Francisco is the only city along California’s coast with  a combined sewer system.125 This outdated system, which  carries sewage and stormwater in the same pipe, was  designed to overflow during heavy rain.126 During intense  rainstorms, sewage from the combined system can leak into  streets and flow into the San Francisco Bay.127 Based on  sewer overflow data from 2009 to 2014, the San Francisco  neighborhoods most likely to flood during heavy rain are  Haight Ashbury, Hayes Valley, Mission, Outer Mission, and  South of Market (SOMA).128 Mission, Hayes Valley, and  SOMA have higher percentages of residents living below 100  and 200 percent of the Census Poverty Threshold than the  city as a whole.129 Outer Mission and SOMA also have higher  percentages of people of color than the city as a whole.  People in lower-income communities may not have the  money to repair flood damage to their homes or to relocate  to safer, less flood-prone areas.130  Coastal flooding associated with sea level rise and heavy  rainstorms can also cause serious and long-lasting damage  to health and safety facilities such as emergency shelters  and hospitals.131 Currently, about 25 critical state-owned  facilities on California’s coast could be flooded by a 100-year  event (severe floods with a 1 percent chance of occurring  in a given year) and another 29 could be operationally  disrupted.132 By the 2080s and 2090s, 100-year floods could  damage 30 facilities and disrupt the operations of 38 others.  More than one-third of the facilities expected to flood at   the end of the century are in communities disadvantaged  by pollution exposure, existing health challenges, and  socioeconomic factors.133   Sea level rise will also disrupt public transit services,  resulting in travel delays and loss of service. According to  a national-level survey in 2016, 68 percent of recent tidal  flooding and storm surge events had minor to moderate  impacts on transit service.134 In December 2014, for  example, a storm that produced 18 inches of storm surge  resulted in several Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) and  Municipal Railway (MUNI) delays and closures in the San  Francisco area.135   Recurring losses of emergency and public transit services  will be especially serious for people who require regular  care for chronic illnesses and those who can’t drive to  medical appointments or emergency rooms.136 From 2006  to 2010, an estimated 10.7 percent of African-American  households in California’s coastal counties lacked access to  a vehicle, compared to 6.5 percent of white households.137   In San Francisco, interviews in 2014 with 50 elderly  residents who received home care services revealed that  41 percent had health issues or disabilities that kept them  trapped at home.138   ACTING ON CLIMATE CAN PROTECT OUR HEALTH  The good news is that cutting back on fossil fuels and  switching to cleaner energy will help limit the dangerous  effects of climate change and protect our health.   California’s greenhouse gas emissions have declined by  10 percent since 2004, thanks to a wide range of state  clean energy and energy efficiency policies including the  California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006.139 From  2007 to 2015 alone, California’s wind and solar power  plants averted the production of nearly 74.6 million metric  tons of carbon dioxide.140 That’s the equivalent of what 183  billion passenger vehicle miles, or more than 73 million trips  around the Earth, would produce. These renewable energy  sources also averted 326 metric tons of sulfur dioxide  and more than 19,000 metric tons of nitrogen oxides (the  building blocks of smog and particle pollution).141 California  has ambitious goals to reduce the state’s economy-wide  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent from 1990 levels  by 2030, and to achieve carbon neutrality by 2045.142 But  achieving these targets will require a lot more work.143  Reductions in fossil fuel-related air pollution have already  improved the health of California’s children. For example,  air quality improvements in eight Southern California  communities significantly reduced the probability of  coughing, chest congestion, and other bronchitic symptoms  from 1993 to 2012.144 Among 10-year-old children with  asthma, the prevalence of bronchitic symptoms declined  16.3 percent per median decrease in ozone and 15.4 percent  per median decrease in fine particle pollution.145     Page 9    NRDCCLIMATE CHANGE AND HEALTH IN CALIFORNIA   California has taken strong steps to reduce the carbon  pollution causing climate change, but can continue to  improve. The transportation sector is California’s largest  source of climate-changing pollution and one of the main  causes of the state’s current air quality problem, even  though transportation emissions have declined since  2007.146 Transportation electrification is a critical part of  continued climate and clean air progress in California and  the rest of the country.147 This process involves switching  from vehicles powered by dirty fossil fuels to ones powered  by low- or zero-carbon sources of clean energy.   California metropolitan planning organizations (regional  committees of city and county officials) should also increase  the ambition of their long-term transportation plans.148 The  existing plans, which include carbon pollution reduction  targets and increased alternatives to car travel (e.g., public  transportation and infrastructure to increase cycling), can  deliver numerous health benefits, including less traffic  jam-induced stress and improved response times by  paramedics.149 However, making these plans more ambitious  in California’s five largest planning regions can further  reduce air pollution and increase physical activity. By 2040,  these efforts could help California avoid more than 900  deaths each year and the equivalent of more than 16,000  years lost to disability or poor health.150   Buildings account for about a quarter of California’s carbon  emissions. Building electrification and increased energy  efficiency can improve the health of Californians and help  them save money on heat and hot water bills.151 Measures  like increasing insulation and installing better windows  can make buildings more efficient and help keep them dry  and comfortable. These efforts also help protect occupants  from extreme heat and indoor asthma triggers such as  mold.152 Using clean electricity generated from pollution-free  renewable resources like wind and solar to power high- efficiency electric heating and water heaters can produce  immediate health benefits by reducing air pollution from  fossil fuel combustion.153   More energy savings from efficiency would also benefit  the health of low-income Californians who may need to  choose between paying for utility bills and other necessities  like food or medicine. A recent survey of 750 low-income  families in Southern California found that 2 in 3 households  had their electricity shut off in the previous three years.154  In 2016, power disconnections affected more than 884,000  California households across Pacific Gas and Electric’s  service territory. Eighty percent of the residents in the 20  ZIP codes with the highest shutoff rates in 2016 were people  of color.155 Rising temperatures and population growth only  fuel more demand for air-conditioning, which will increase  the importance of energy efficiency.156 Without smarter  energy use in Los Angeles County, for example, electricity  demand could increase up to 87 percent by 2060.157   Finally, California needs to continue to refine its plan to  address the harmful health impacts of climate change  that are already being felt today. The 2018 update to the  California Natural Resources Agency’s Safeguarding  California Plan is one of the most comprehensive  climate resilience roadmaps in the country.158 Policy  recommendations in the health chapter include improving  emergency preparedness in local health departments and  transit agencies, promoting strategies that reduce carbon  pollution and help keep heat-sensitive neighborhoods cool,  and developing data analyses and tools to guide health  interventions. The plan also addresses socioeconomic  inequities that make people more vulnerable to the health  impacts of climate change.159 For example, measures to make  California’s agricultural system less energy intensive and  more resilient to climate change could improve the financial  and food security of farmworkers and increase access to  fresh, healthy foods in urban areas.160   However, as the plan’s authors point out, the  recommendations “do not serve as comprehensive guidance  for how to adapt to climate change.” For instance, one  of the action items is to “encourage agencies to make  resources available to support people suffering mental  health consequences.” There are no details about how to  actually implement this action item—which is perhaps not  surprising, given California’s complex funding mechanism  for mental health services.161 California must continue to  work with both internal and external stakeholders to turn  many of the next steps in Safeguarding California into  detailed, implementable projects and programs.162  The bottom line is that California residents have much to  gain from climate action—and lives to lose if we fail to clean  up climate-changing pollution and build resilience to the  present-day harms of climate change.   ©  D  orling K indersley/A  lam y    Page 10    NRDCCLIMATE CHANGE AND HEALTH IN CALIFORNIA   ENDNOTES  1  Donald J.
