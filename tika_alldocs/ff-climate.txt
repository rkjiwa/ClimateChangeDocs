Fact #1  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, Integer  commodo arcu eget    A Changing Climate      There is global consensus among climate scientists that climate change is  happening, and human activity is the cause.i Communities must be prepared  to join others to respond to the impacts of climate change (climate  adaptation) while at the same time reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions  (climate change mitigation) to minimize climate impacts.    Leaders in our community are already stepping up and taking action to reduce  climate impacts.  The City is working on an update to the Community Climate  Action Plan, FortisBC is promoting a breadth of programs and funding options  to advance energy reductions, and schools are enhancing their curriculum to  teach our children about the environmental, ecological and educational  values of modifying our human behaviours.  Actions like these inspire a more  resilient position, but we need to do more at the community level.    Climate change is not something that needs to be addressed in the distant  future, it is happening now and the change affects everyone. Environmental,  social and economic problems are already being experienced in Canadian  communities, and these are projected to increase.ii Locally, Kelowna  experienced one of its most extreme weather years on record in 2017.  Extreme spring precipitation led to historic flooding of Okanagan Lake,  Mission Creek and Mill Creek, impacting approximately 3,200 residents and  causing approximately $10.7 million dollars in damage to City property and  infrastructure, and this does not take into account the costs for private  property damage.iii This was followed by one of the hottest and driest July  and August on record iv, factors contributing to a devastating wildfire season  and the community blanketed in smoke. As the impacts of climate change  continue to grow, these types of extreme weather events are expected to  occur more regularly.   GHG Emissions in Kelowna      In 2012, Kelowna’s greenhouse gas  (GHG) emissions were over 642,000  tonnes, or about 5.4 tonnes per capita.   This equates to $341 million in energy  expenditures, about $3,000 per person  per year.  While 2012 emissions  showed a slight decline from the 2007  baseline, preliminary data indicates  that, since this time, emissions are  rising.       Source: City of Kelowna, 2018.  Community  Climate Action Plan DRAFT.          FACTS IN FOCUS 2            CURRENT INITIATIVES                                 There have many initiatives related to  Climate since the 2011 OCP.  The following  are either in progress or endorsed:     Community Climate Action Plan     Corporate Energy and Emissions Plan     Urban Centres Roadmap    Pedestrian and Bicycle Master Plan    Transportation Master Plan     Regional Strategic Transportation Plan     Regional Solid Waste Management  Plan     Energy Step Code Implementation  Strategy    Community Energy Retrofit Strategy    Urban Forestry Strategy    Neighbourwoods     Moving towards a low carbon future is a monumental challenge, but planning for a healthy and resilient environment is  also an enormous opportunity.  Communities across BC, Canada, and abroad are taking up the responsibility on  energy, sustainability and climate solutions.   These solutions are ever more feasible, and the need to lead is ever more  pressing.  Community benefits are broad reaching from healthier residents, promoting a more livable and prosperous  community, to notable reductions in energy costs.   A dynamic community that embraces diverse transportation options to shift away from a car-centric culture; growing  vibrant urban centres and shifting away from sprawl; and protecting land, water and air will attract jobs in the new  global economy, is healthier for citizens, and will be resilient in the face of a changing climate.   The tide is turning. Recently, the US saw three times more employees working in renewable energy than those in fossil  fuelsv and China’s solar and wind capacity continue to grow beyond expected targets vi and the Netherlands made a  commitment for all new cars to be emission-free by 2030vii.     Current Direction of the 2030 Official Community Plan  The current OCP sets a target for reducing emissions, and all stakeholders in our community (government, local  residents, and businesses) must play a role. While the OCP has one specific policy on reducing greenhouse gas  emissions, policies throughout the document support the creation of a low carbon community while continuing to  ensure the city is a desirable place to call home.       Contain urban sprawl: The OCP introduced a Permanent Growth Boundary to contain sprawl and beyond  which no significant development is supported.    Develop complete communities: Encouraging the development of complete communities in the five urban  centres that support live-work developments, amenities and optimizing land use.    Focus growth in Urban Centres: Directing investments (parks, streetscaping, bike lanes, etc.) to the City’s  urban core and urban centres to attract investment and encourage growth.    Prioritize sustainable modes of transportation: Prioritizing streets that are designed to serve a broader range  of transportation modes focusing on pedestrians, cyclists, and transit service.    Improve the energy efficiency of new buildings: Embracing sustainable solutions to improve the efficiency  and performance of buildings.      FACTS IN FOCUS 3               DID YOU KNOW?         A number of sustainable  transportation solutions within  the urban centres have been  funded by the OCP’s DCC  program, reducing  transportation-related  emissions by making  commuting by walking, cycling  or transit easier.         The most recent Census (2016)  shows that the commute to  work remains dominated by  vehicles (79 per cent as driver, 5  per cent as passenger).      Reduce and divert solid waste: Providing opportunities to reduce  and reuse waste in order to reduce the carbon footprint  associated with it.    Increase local food production: Encouraging more local food  production to reduce reliance on imports by promoting healthy  and productive agriculture and encouraging opportunities for  local food production through community gardens and farmer’s  markets.     A number of policies in the 2030 OCP have been successful at curbing the  growth of greenhouse gas emissions. With respect to development, the  introduction of a Permanent Growth Boundary was to concentrate  development and supporting infrastructure within its boundaries while  simultaneously preserving agriculture and our natural resources. The  Permanent Growth Boundary has been successful and has remained  largely intact since its inception. Policies directing development to the  urban core have also shown some success, with Kelowna seeing 40 per  cent viii of all new residential units constructed within the Urban Core in  2017, up from 25 per cent in 2015ix.     Strategic Direction from Imagine Kelowna  The City and community partners recently undertook the most extensive  public engagement process to date to create a new community vision for  the future. Imagine Kelowna is a vision for building a prosperous and  sustainable city in the face of an uncertain future. The City will use  Imagine Kelowna to help shape its short and long-term planning priorities  and provide the foundation for future strategies, plans and projects. The  wording of the Imagine Kelowna draft goals may change, however, the  overall direction of the goals was supported by City Council at the March  12, 2018 City Council meeting. Key draft directions from Imagine Kelowna  include:   Principles: Connected    Embrace diverse transportation options to shift away from our  car-centric culture     Principles: Smarter      Take action and be resilient in the face of climate change    Principles: Responsible      Concentrate on growing vibrant urban centres and limit urban  sprawl    Strengthen the protection of our land, water and air resources    Protect agricultural land and promote sustainable farming    Preserve Okanagan Lake as a shared resource       FACTS IN FOCUS 4            FAST FACTS         36%  The percentage of emissions that come from buildings  in Kelowna.       40%  Policies directing development to the urban core have  shown success, with Kelowna seeing 40 per cent of all  new residential units constructed within the Urban Core  in 2017.       25%  Percentage of new residential units constructed  within the Urban Core in 2015.                      Imagine Kelowna stresses the need for complete compact communities  that support walking, cycling and transit. Focusing new housing in  urban centres, making these centres easy to get around for daily trips  without a car, and attracting a variety of businesses, services and  amenities will create vibrant centres that not only will reduce  greenhouse gas emissions by being more efficient but will also improve  quality of life by making it easier for people to live, work, shop and play  in the same neighbourhood.xxi     Looking Ahead: Future Trends  Climate change is already occurring. Regions across the globe have  been and will be impacted in different ways and using the past as a  predictor of the future is no longer viable. Over the last century, British   Columbia’s Southern Interior warmed 0.9C xxii and despite annual  precipitation increasing 17 per cent in the regionxxiii, snow depth  decreased by 11 per cent in the second half of the centuryxxiv. Looking  to the future, the Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium predicts the  Okanagan-Similkameen’s climate will change significantly in the  coming decadesxxv:           These changes in climate will have impactsxxvi on many aspects of the  community including:    1. Water resources. Declining snowpack and warmer summers could   lead to increased drought and less water available for residents  during the summer when demand is high. Increased precipitation  could result in increased flooding. Further, earlier snowmelt and  less spring snowpack will mean less water in streams for fish and  wildlife during hot summers.     2. Agriculture. Hotter summers will increase the demand for  irrigation at a time when water availability will be low. A warmer  climate will increase pests.   3. Biodiversity. A warmer climate could impact the types of species  that call the Okanagan home, as some will move to cooler climates  and others may take their place.   4. Trees. With a warmer climate, trees will be at increased risk for  pests such as pine beetle.     FACTS IN FOCUS 5                                  5. Tourism. The tourism sector could be significantly impacted. With  reduced snow comes reduced winter recreation opportunities.  Hotter, drier summers will increase forest fire risks, thus impacting air  quality. These extremes were observed in 2017, with Tourism  Kelowna noting a seven per cent decrease in hotel occupancy in July  due to beaches and boat launches that were closed due to flooding as  well as poor air quality due to smoke from nearby forest fires xxvii.    6. Energy. While warmer winters could result in less demand for energy  for heating, hotter summers will increase the demand for cooling.    7. Infrastructure. Major flooding events will put increased demands on  storm water systems. Upgrades or retrofits to vulnerable flood and  erosion control infrastructure may be required. The 2017 flood events  resulted in $10.7 million in damages to the City’s infrastructure  including stormwater systems, parks, walking paths, bridges,  retaining walls, roads and other public properties xxviii.    8. Health. The World Health Organization has said that “climate change  is the greatest threat to global health in the 21st century” xxix. Health  impacts due to climate change are numerous including heat related  stress (especially for vulnerable populations such as seniors, children,  etc.), reduced air quality, and poorer water quality. This was seen in  Kelowna in 2017 when the City water utility issued a water quality  advisory for 1.5 months due to high turbidity from high stream flows.  This was followed by the community blanketed in smoke and the air  quality health index was high for 25 days impacting vulnerable  populations and requiring many others to stay indoors xxx.     Current Challenges of the 2030 Official Community Plan  While the current OCP has established sound policy direction, more needs to be done to reduce emissions and prepare  the community for a changing climate. The decisions made today will have long-term impacts on Kelowna’s  greenhouse gas emissions. Policy and choices that support suburban development and reliance on automobiles sets  Kelowna on a path for continual increases in GHG emissions for decades to come x. However, by investigating options  for Kelowna to become more compact, complete community this will lower reliance on vehicles and consequently  emissions.     While we see the effects of climate change, the personal and business choices that we make do not necessarily match  the direction that climate change requires us to take.   These include:     Behavior change. Although most people are aware and concerned about climate change, it does not translate into   action xi. As seen in Imagine Kelowna, the community’s long term desire to be less car dependent, reduce sprawl  and to take action on climate change does not align with the current community behavior. For example,  transportation (specifically traffic congestion) continues to be a top issue in the biannual citizen survey xii. The gap  remains on how to connect with individuals and the community to promote sustainable behavior.    Growing community. With an estimated growth of 50,000 residents between now and 2040, community  emissions could continue to grow even with a decline in per capita emissions. Despite more development  happening in the urban core, population growth will continue to put pressure on undeveloped land in Kelowna’s  suburban and rural areas.      FACTS IN FOCUS 6             Car-dependant neighbourhoods. Many Kelowna neighbourhoods lack sufficient density to support transit and   are too far away for walking and cycling to be convenient, so residents must rely on their automobile. The most  recent Census (2016) shows that the commute to work remains dominated by vehicles (79 per cent as driver, 5  per cent as passenger). Despite a nineteen per cent increase in the percentage of people choosing to walk, cycle  or take transit to work (to nearly 14 per cent in 2016) xiii, fuel sales (and associated emissions) continue to  increase, up 14 per cent since 2012xiv.     Low efficiency buildings. 36 per cent of emissions come from buildings in Kelowna. Progress is being made on  increasing energy efficiency of new buildings (for example the introduction of the Provincial Energy Step Code  which calls for all buildings to be net zero energy ready by 2032). This does not address existing buildings, 72 per  cent of which were constructed prior to 2000xiv. Typical life expectancies of buildings can be for over half a  century.    Funding change. The Stern report confirms that the benefits of strong and early investment in climate change  prevention far outweigh the economic costs of inaction xvi. However, this issue is competing with other high  priority issues for limited government dollars such as housing and homelessness, and there is little appetite for  tax increases at any level of government. The costs, however, could far outweigh the risks. The 2017 flooding  event cost the City over $10.7 million xvii (not including private property damage), and if these flooding or fire  events become more frequent, these costs will only continue to rise.    Adaptation Measures. The current OCP is silent on climate adaptation, specifically policies that are needed to  minimize the impacts from changing climatic conditions. Kelowna, like the rest of the province, has already  experienced extreme weather, flooding, droughts and fires, and these impacts are anticipated to become more  severe and/or frequent xviii. Preparing to become resilient to these changes is crucial. Exploring the use of green  infrastructure which can increase flood protection while providing shade, reducing heat in the urban core and  improving air quality is one option. These improvements not only help the community adapt to climate change  but also reduce GHG emissions, and can provide health, social and economic benefits xix.      FACTS IN FOCUS 7         HEALTH AND CLIMATE CHANGE                The World Health Organization has said that  “climate change is the greatest threat to  global health in the 21st century” xxix   Key Directions for the 2040 Official Community Plan  Even without growth, emissions will remain constant if infrastructure isn’t provided to make walking, cycling, and  transit the convenient choice for most trips. Without new infrastructure, new technology that will help reduce GHG  emissions such as electric vehicles or driverless shared vehicles won’t be able to become common place.  When we  reduce fossil-fuel pollution, it improves the health and security of our community.  We can slow the rising  temperatures that are changing weather patterns and causing more intense storms and heat waves, which in turn  affect food and energy prices, as well as threaten our city infrastructure and health and safety of our families.      By taking action, we can be prepared for climate impacts, enhance our community, create good local jobs, and make  our neighborhoods more attractive places to live in.   Committing to policy and actions that create the desired future  residents are asking for in Imagine Kelowna is intricately linked to climate change. By taking action, residents can  benefit from:    1. Healthy, complete community. That includes healthy transportation options, quality housing, access to healthy   food, expansive urban forest and good air quality. Saying no to development in the fringe results in a compact  efficient city, with a corresponding transportation system that has a lighter environmental footprint. Further a  complete, compact community is more economical to operate and maintain.    2. Economic development. Promoting Kelowna as environmentally conscious can help attract green innovation.  3. Reduced energy consumption. In 2012, Kelowna residents spent approximately $3,000 per capita on energy.   Reducing energy consumption saves residents and businesses money and also increases the dollars available for  local goods and services.   4. Social benefits. Transportation and housing choices represent the two largest expenditures for most working  households. Energy efficient homes in complete communities reduce utility costs for residents and save  transportation costs by reducing the need for vehicle ownership.     In addition to achieving the goals of Imagine Kelowna, there are  several changes on the horizon that could change the way  communities develop and help to significantly reduce GHG  emissions. Automakers are making commitments to reduce  reliance on fossil fuels making electric vehicles become  mainstream. Emission reductions achieved by shifting to  electric vehicles will be further compounded with the  introduction and growth of driverless shared vehicles (some  predict that fully automated vehicles will become the prevailing  mode of urban transportation by the 2030sxxxi). Some studies  show that if cities embrace vehicle technology, automation,  electrification and ride sharing, there can be an 80 per cent cut  in GHG emissions compared to the business as usual option. xxxii   Further, all new buildings will be required to be net zero energy   ready in BC by 2032 (the BC Energy Step Code) and older building stock will start to be replaced with energy efficient  buildings. Communities endorsing higher energy efficiency requirements early will ensure that more buildings will     FACTS IN FOCUS 8                        have these efficiencies built in. Further, it is hoped that the annual increases to the provincial carbon tax xxxiii will  encourage the reduction of fossil fuel use.     Success on reducing emissions and being prepared for a changing climate may require a new approach to policy and  infrastructure investments. The shift to complete communities that allows for convenient access to alternative modes  of transportation for daily commutes and errands will require leadership from the City, residents, businesses and  development community. It may require making bold decisions on where new development goes and choosing to  prioritize infrastructure funds differently from the past.  Ultimately, the move to vibrant urban centres with diverse  transportation options creates a healthy city for all.    The greatest action on climate begins with us.  We have the capacity and community will to make a difference that will  benefit our environment, our economy, our quality of life and our City’s resiliency.
