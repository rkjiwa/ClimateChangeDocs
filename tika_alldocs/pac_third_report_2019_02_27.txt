Nils Clarke, MLA Speaker Yukon Legislative Assembly  Dear Sir:  On behalf of the members of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts, appointed by order of the 34th Yukon Legislative Assembly, I have the honour to present the committee’s Third Report.  Yukon Legislative Assembly Standing Committee on Public Accounts  34th Yukon Legislative Assembly  Stacey Hassard, MLA Chair    i     Preface    The Standing Committee on Public Accounts  The basic purpose of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts is to ensure  economy, efficiency and effectiveness in public spending. The committee’s authority is  derived from Standing Order 45(3) of the Standing Orders of the Yukon Legislative  Assembly, which says   At the commencement of the first Session of each Legislature a Standing  Committee on Public Accounts shall be appointed and the Public Accounts and  all Reports of the Auditor General shall stand referred automatically and  permanently to the said Committee as they become available.   On January 12, 2017, the Yukon Legislative Assembly adopted the following motion:  THAT Stacey Hassard, Paolo Gallina, Ted Adel, Don Hutton, Wade Istchenko  and Liz Hanson be appointed to the Standing Committee on Public Accounts  established pursuant to Standing Order 45(3),  THAT the Committee have the power to call for persons, papers and records and  to sit during intersessional periods; and  THAT the Clerk of the Legislative Assembly be responsible for providing the  necessary support services to the Committee. (Motion No. 6)   The committee first met on March 1, 2017. At that meeting, the committee elected  Stacey Hassard as Chair and Paolo Gallina as Vice-Chair.  On November 15, 2018, the Legislative Assembly adopted Motion No. 380, rescinding  Mr. Hutton’s appointment to the committee and appointing the Honourable Richard  Mostyn to it.    This report  On December 5, 2017, Michael Ferguson, CPA, CA, FCA, Auditor General of Canada,  released Report of the Auditor General of Canada to the Yukon Legislative Assembly -  2017: Climate Change in Yukon. The report was presented to the Hon. Nils Clarke, the  Speaker of the Yukon Legislative Assembly, that morning. The Speaker then authorized  its distribution to Members of the Legislative Assembly. Once members had received their  copies the report was posted to the website of the Auditor General of Canada. At that  point the report became a public document.    On the same day Members of the Yukon Legislative Assembly had the opportunity to ask  questions of the Auditor General at an in-camera briefing in the Legislative Assembly  chamber.    The Public Accounts committee of the 34th Legislative Assembly first discussed the  Auditor General’s report at a meeting held on December 5, 2017. At this meeting the  committee adopted the following motion:   AGREED, on Motion of Ms. White, seconded by Mr. Adel,     ii     “THAT the Standing Committee on Public Accounts hold a public hearing on the  performance audit report entitled Report of the Auditor General of Canada to the  Yukon Legislative Assembly – December, 2017: Climate Change in Yukon, during  the week of February 12, 2018, with the exact date of the public hearing to be  determined in consultation with the Office of the Auditor General of Canada.”   At its meeting on January 17, 2018, the committee adopted the following motion:  AGREED, on motion of Mr. Adel, seconded by Mr. Gallina,   “THAT the Standing Committee on Public Accounts hold a public hearing on  Wednesday, February 14, 2018, on the Report of the Auditor General of Canada to  the Yukon Legislative Assembly – December, 2017: Climate Change in Yukon.”     In preparation for the public hearing the committee also held meetings on February 5 and  13, 2018. At these meetings members discussed the Auditor General’s report, and drafted  questions which were distributed amongst the committee members.     Prior to the public hearing, the Department of Community Services, the Department of  Environment, the Department of Energy, Mines and Resources, and the Department of  Highways and Public Works provided the committee with an action plan to update the  committee on progress made since the release of the Auditor General’s report. The  document provided by the departments is appended to this report.    The public hearing took place on Wednesday, February 14, 2018. Witnesses appeared,  from the Department of Community Services, the Department of Environment, the  Department of Energy, Mines and Resources, and the Department of Highways and  Public Works. The transcripts of the hearing are appended to this report.     Committee member Don Hutton was not available to participate in the public hearing. The  Hon. Tracy-Anne McPhee served as his substitute for the hearing. Kate White also served  as a substitute for committee member Liz Hanson for a portion of the public hearing, when  Ms. Hanson was unavailable.     Mr. Hutton was replaced on the committee by the Hon. Richard Mostyn when the  Legislative Assembly adopted Motion No. 380 on November 15, 2018. The committee  held meetings February 14, March 28, April 17, 2018 and February 26, 2019, to prepare  its third report. Scott Kent served as a substitute for committee member Wade Istchenko  for the meeting on February 26, 2019. The Hon. Mr. Mostyn did not participate in the  committee’s discussions on its report.    Following the public hearing, the committee received additional written information from  the Department of Community Services, the Department of Environment, the Department  of Energy, Mines and Resources, and the Department of Highways and Public Works on  February 25, 2019.     The Auditor General’s report, transcripts of the public hearing, documents submitted by  the departments and this report may be found on the committee’s web page at:   http://www.legassembly.gov.yk.ca/committees/pac.html     http://www.legassembly.gov.yk.ca/committees/pac.html   iii       The committee would like to thank officials from the Office of the Auditor General of  Canada for their assistance in preparing the committee for the hearings and in assisting  in the preparation of this report.    The committee would also like to thank the officials from the Department of Community  Services, the Department of Environment, the Department of Energy, Mines and  Resources, and the Department of Highways and Public Works, who appeared as  witnesses at the public hearing and provided additional information after the public  hearing.     1          Standing Committee on Public Accounts    34th Yukon Legislative Assembly     Third Report  February 2019   Introduction  1. On December 5, 2017 Michael Ferguson, CPA, CA, FCA, the Auditor General of  Canada (the Auditor General), issued an audit report entitled, Report of the Auditor  General of Canada to the Yukon Legislative Assembly - 2017: Climate Change in Yukon.  In conducting the audit, the Auditor General   … focused on whether selected Government of Yukon departments had worked  to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to adapt to the impacts of climate  change, taking into account present and future generations. The departments  selected for the audit were the Department of Environment; the Department of  Energy, Mines and Resources; the Department of Highways and Public Works;  and the Department of Community Services.1   2. The Auditor General summarized his conclusions as follows:   • Overall, [the Office of the Auditor General] found that the Government of Yukon  created a strategy, an action plan, and two progress reports to respond to climate  change. In developing these items, the government took good first steps toward  providing leadership and direction for responding to climate change. However, the  commitments in the government’s action plan and progress reports were weak and  not prioritized. In addition, deficiencies in the Climate Change Secretariat’s  reporting made it difficult to assess progress on the government’s climate change  actions. 2   • [The Office of the Auditor General] found that although the Department of  Environment; the Department of Energy, Mines and Resources; and the  Department of Community Services had begun to lay the groundwork for adapting  to climate change by gathering information, they took limited concrete action. In  {the Office of the Auditor General’s] opinion, the benefits of gathering information                                                     1 Auditor General of Canada, Report of the Auditor General of Canada to the Yukon Legislative Assembly  - 2017: Climate Change in Yukon, December 2017, paragraph 10.  2 Auditor General of Canada, Report of the Auditor General of Canada to the Yukon Legislative Assembly  - 2017: Climate Change in Yukon, December 2017, paragraph 16.     2     are fully realized only when the information is used to take action in a timely  manner. 3   3. The Auditor General’s report made four recommendations. The departments  agreed with all the recommendations.   The Standing Committee on Public Accounts  4. The Standing Committee on Public Accounts of the Yukon Legislative Assembly is  established by Standing Order 45(3) of the Standing Orders of the Yukon Legislative  Assembly. This Standing Order says that: “At the commencement of the first Session of  each Legislature a Standing Committee on Public Accounts shall be appointed and the  Public Accounts and all Reports of the Auditor General shall stand referred automatically  and permanently to the said committee as they become available.”4  5. On January 12, 2017, the Yukon Legislative Assembly adopted Motion No. 6,  which established the current Public Accounts Committee. In addition to appointing  members to the committee, the motion stipulated that the committee shall “have the  power to call for persons, papers and records and to sit during intersessional periods.”  6. In his opening remarks at the public hearing, the Chair described the committee’s  role in the audit process:    The Public Accounts Committee is an all-party committee with a mandate to  ensure economy, efficiency and effectiveness in public spending — in other words,  accountability for the use of public funds. The purpose of this public hearing is to  address issues of the implementation of policies — whether programs are being  effectively and efficiently delivered — and not to question the policies of the  Government of Yukon. In other words, our task is not to challenge government  policy but to examine its implementation.5   7. The committee accepts and endorses the recommendations made by the Auditor  General. The committee’s report will not repeat in detail information contained in the  Auditor General’s report. Neither will this report attempt to summarize all the evidence  given before the committee at its public hearing, held February 14, 2018. The transcript  of the public hearing is appended to this report. Instead, this report will focus on those  issues that – in the opinion of the committee – merit further comment.  8. The committee is encouraged by the departments’ acceptance of the Auditor  General’s recommendations. The committee is concerned, however, by the lack of action  to deal with the problems identified in the report. Based on the evidence provided by  witnesses during the public hearing, the committee believes that the departments have  not taken sufficient action to address the Auditor General’s recommendations.                                                     3 Auditor General of Canada, Report of the Auditor General of Canada to the Yukon Legislative Assembly  - 2017: Climate Change in Yukon, December 2017, paragraph 45.  4 Yukon Legislative Assembly, Standing Orders of the Yukon Legislative Assembly (October 30, 2012),  page 24.  5 Yukon Legislative Assembly, Standing Committee on Public Accounts, Public Proceedings: Evidence,  February 14, 2018 page 3-1.     3     Lack of milestones and measurable timelines  9. The committee observed that the Department of Community Services, the  Department of Environment, the Department of Energy, Mines and Resources, and the  Department of Highways and Public Works appear to be stuck in a strategy loop with no  set timelines or measurable milestones. This does not allow for progress to be properly  tracked.   10. The Auditor General noted during the public hearing:   … [The government] created a climate change strategy and made 70 commitments  to respond to climate change. These were good first steps in providing leadership  and direction. However, the commitments weren’t ranked and most didn’t have  milestones or completion dates, which would make it difficult to measure  progress.6  …  The departments need to turn their commitments into concrete action to  successfully adapt to the impacts of climate change and to reduce greenhouse gas  emissions.7   11. The committee observed that progress reports were provided in 2012 and 2015  but there is currently no timeline for the next reporting period. Joe MacGillivray, Deputy  Minister of the Department of Environment, stated:   The next three-year period is 2018 but, because we are transitioning into a new  strategy … there is an outstanding question about what reporting will happen  between now and the completion of that strategy.8   12. The witnesses acknowledged the need for timelines and better reporting during  the public hearing. In speaking to the development of future commitments,  Mr. MacGillivray, told the committee:   …we do anticipate at this point in time that the commitments that are made in our  new strategy will be time-bound and costed, and they will identify estimates of the  greenhouse gas emissions that will be established up front, and then it’s a matter  of – as long as we have regular reporting on that, I think that is the accountability  mechanism.9  …                                                     6 Yukon Legislative Assembly, Standing Committee on Public Accounts, Public Proceedings: Evidence,  February 14, 2018 page 3-1  7 Yukon Legislative Assembly, Standing Committee on Public Accounts, Public Proceedings: Evidence,  February 14, 2018 page 3-2  8 Yukon Legislative Assembly, Standing Committee on Public Accounts, Public Proceedings: Evidence,  February 14, 2018 page 3-18  9 Yukon Legislative Assembly, Standing Committee on Public Accounts, Public Proceedings: Evidence,  February 14, 2018 page 3-17     4     We have learned through this audit that we need to have consistent reporting. It  needs to happen on a consistent time frame and needs to be clear and transparent.  Those are some of the principles that we’re going to be looking to incorporate.10   13. Recommendation No. 1: THAT the departments should differentiate between  targets and commitments.  14. Recommendation No. 2: THAT timelines should be assigned to all departmental  commitments.   Need for departmental lead  15. The committee believes an overarching target needs to be set. From there,  departments must communicate to discuss how they will reach this target together.   16. The committee observed during the public hearing that there appeared to be a lack  of a departmental lead. In responding to a question on which department would be leading  the development of the new climate change strategy, Kirsten Burrows, Acting Director of  the Climate Change Secretariat, noted:   All three departments are leading jointly — Energy, Mines and Resources,  Environment, and Economic Development.11   17. In their updates to the committee a year after the public hearing, the deputy  ministers noted no one department is leading the development of the new climate change  strategy:   On the Yukon government side, this initiative is being co-lead by the departments  of Environment, Energy Mines and Resources, and Economic Development.12   18. Recommendation No. 3: THAT one department be responsible for leading the  new strategy on climate change and THAT the departments advise the committee which  department is taking the lead.  19. Recommendation No. 4: THAT the framework for the new strategy on climate  change be submitted to the committee by August 1, 2019.   Conclusion  20. The committee would like to thank officials from the Office of the Auditor General  of Canada for their work in compiling the report and for the assistance offered to the  committee in preparation for the public hearing.                                                     10 Yukon Legislative Assembly, Standing Committee on Public Accounts, Public Proceedings: Evidence,  February 14, 2018 page 3-19  11 Yukon Legislative Assembly, Standing Committee on Public Accounts, Public Proceedings: Evidence,  February 14, 2018 page 3-14  12 Letter re: Status update to the Standing Committee on Public Accounts, dated February 18, 2019, from  John L.

Pitfield, Deputy Minister of  Highways and Public Works     5     21. The committee would also like to thank the departments for agreeing with, and  committing to implement the recommendations in the Auditor General’s report.  22. Further, the committee would like to thank the witnesses from the Department of  Community Services, the Department of Environment, the Department of Energy, Mines  and Resources, and the Department of Highways and Public Works, who appeared  before the committee at the public hearing held on February 14, 2018.  23. Finally, the Public Accounts Committee wishes to note that the committee will  follow up on the implementation of the recommendations contained in this report and in  the Auditor General’s report. This follow-up will include a review by the committee in  September of 2019 and may also include holding further public hearings. In his closing  remarks at the public hearing, the Chair expressed the committee’s commitment to further  examination:   …a vital component to these hearings and the process that we undertake as a  committee to address reports from the Auditor General is the completion of the  commitments that departments themselves make. The completion of commitments  is a priority for this Public Accounts Committee and we will continue to follow up  with departments to track progress.13                                                         13 Yukon Legislative Assembly, Standing Committee on Public Accounts, Public Proceedings: Evidence,  February 14, 2018 page 3-31     6     Summary of Public Accounts Committee Recommendations    Recommendation No. 1: THAT the departments should differentiate between targets  and commitments.

The Public Accounts Committee is established by   Standing Order 45(3) of the Standing Orders of the Yukon   Legislative Assembly. This Standing Order says: “At the   commencement of the first Session of each Legislature, a   Standing Committee on Public Accounts shall be appointed   and the Public Accounts and all Reports of the Auditor   General shall stand referred automatically and permanently to   the said committee as they become available.”   On January 12, 2017, the Yukon Legislative Assembly   adopted Motion No. 6, which established the current Public   Accounts Committee. In addition to appointing members to   the Committee, the motion stipulated that the Committee shall   “have the power to call for persons, papers and records and to   sit during intersessional periods.”   Today, pursuant to Standing Order 45(3) and Motion   No. 6, the Committee will investigate the Auditor General of   Canada’s Report, entitled Report of the Auditor General of   Canada to the Yukon Legislative Assembly — 2017: Climate   Change in Yukon.   I would like to firstly thank the witnesses from the   departments of Community Services, Environment, Energy,   Mines and Resources, and Highways and Public Works for   appearing. I believe that the deputy ministers will introduce   these witnesses during their opening remarks. Also present   today are the officials from the Office of the Auditor General   of Canada. We have Michael Ferguson, the Auditor General   of Canada, and with him is Casey Thomas, Principal.    I will now introduce the members of the Public Accounts   Committee: myself, Stacey Hassard — I am the Chair of the   Committee and Member of the Legislative Assembly for Pelly   Nisutlin; to my left is Paolo Gallina, who is the Committee’s   vice-chair and Member for Porter Creek Centre; to his left is   Liz Hanson, Member for Whitehorse Centre; to her left is   Ted Adel, Member for Copperbelt North; to his left is Wade   Istchenko, Member for Kluane; and behind me is the   Hon. Tracy-Anne McPhee, who is substituting for Committee   member Don Hutton.   The Public Accounts Committee is an all-party committee   with a mandate to ensure economy, efficiency and   effectiveness in public spending — in other words,   accountability for the use of public funds. The purpose of this   public hearing is to address issues of climate change in   Yukon. Our task is not to challenge government policy but to   examine its implementation. The results of our deliberations   will be reported back to the Legislative Assembly.   To begin the proceedings, Mr. Ferguson will give an   opening statement summarizing the findings in the Auditor   General’s report. The deputy ministers will then be invited to   make opening statements on behalf of their departments, and   Committee members will then ask questions. As is the   Committee’s practice, the members devise and compile the   questions collectively. We then divide them up among the   members, and the questions that each member will ask are not   their personal questions on a particular subject but those of the   entire Committee.   After the hearing, the Committee will prepare a report of   its proceedings, including any recommendations that the   Committee wishes to make. This report will be tabled in the   Legislative Assembly.    Before we start the hearing today, I would ask that   questions and answers be kept brief and to the point so that we   may deal with as many issues as possible in the time allotted   for this hearing.   I would also ask that Committee members, witnesses and   officials from the Office of the Auditor General wait until they   are recognized by me before speaking as this will keep the   discussion more orderly and allow those listening on the radio   or over the Internet to know who is speaking.   With that, we will now proceed with Mr. Ferguson’s   opening statements.   Mr. Ferguson: Mr. Chair, I am pleased to be in   Whitehorse today to discuss our report on climate change in   Yukon. This report was submitted on December 5 of last year   in the Yukon Legislative Assembly. Joining me today is   Casey Thomas, the Principal responsible for the audit.   Research shows that climate change is happening faster in   the north than anywhere else in Canada. Yukon is   experiencing significant changes, which are affecting its land,   wildlife and people. These changes can damage infrastructure,   ecosystems and traditional ways of life.    In 2016, many legislative audit offices across Canada   decided to look at the issue of climate change and they   developed similar audit approaches and questions to examine   climate change action within their governments. As part of   this initiative, the Office of the Auditor General of Canada   decided to do federal and territorial climate change audits.    To date, 10 out of 13 jurisdictions have submitted their   audit reports and a report summarizing these audits will be   issued in the spring.    In this audit, we looked at the Government of Yukon’s   efforts to adapt to the impacts of climate change and to reduce   greenhouse gas emissions. We noted that the government had   created a climate change strategy and made 70 commitments   to respond to climate change. These were good first steps in   providing leadership and direction. However, the   commitments weren’t ranked and most didn’t have milestones   or completion dates, which would make it difficult to measure   progress.    The Climate Change Secretariat also prepared two reports   on the government’s progress on its climate change   commitments, but these reports weren’t clear or consistent.   For example, the reporting on the formal 70 climate change   commitments was mixed in with reporting on other climate   change activities. This made it difficult to follow progress on   the commitments themselves.    One of our most concerning findings was that the   departments of Energy, Mines and Resources and Community     3-2 STANDING COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC ACCOUNTS February 14, 2018      Services had gathered and produced information on adapting   to climate change but had taken little concrete action. For   instance, in 2009, the Department of Energy, Mines and   Resources assessed how climate change was affecting   Yukon’s trees, but it failed to implement measures that were   recommended in the assessment. In another instance, between   2011 and 2016, the Department of Community Services   produced information to help communities understand   whether they were at risk for forest fires and floods, but they   did not produce this information for all communities.   Although gathering information is an important step, it’s not   enough. The benefits of the information can be fully realized   only when it’s used to take concrete action.    We also concluded that the four departments that we   looked at had not done enough to meet the government’s   targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Either the   departments did not meet many of the government’s 12 targets   for reducing greenhouse gas emissions or they were unable to   measure their progress against those targets. The departments   need to turn their commitments into concrete action to   successfully adapt to the impacts of climate change and to   reduce greenhouse gas emissions.    We made four recommendations to help the four   departments plan and lead climate change efforts. All of the   departments have agreed to implement our recommendations.    Mr. Chair, this concludes my opening statement. We   would be happy to answer any questions the Committee may   have. Thank you.    Mr. MacGillivray: Good morning.    I’m Joe MacGillivray. I’m the Deputy Minister of   Environment. With me is Sherri Young, the ADM of   Corporate Services, and Kirsten Burrows, the director of the   Climate Change Secretariat.    The Department of Environment is pleased to appear   before the Public Accounts Committee to respond to the audit   conducted in 2017 by the Auditor General of Canada on the   Government of Yukon’s response to climate change.    The Department of Environment takes the leading role in   supporting sustainable interactions with our environment, and   importantly for today, in helping to address the challenge of   global climate change.    It’s important to note that Yukon, like other northern   jurisdictions, has unique challenges with respect of climate   change. Climate change has a greater and faster impact on the   north than other parts of the world. For example, over the past   50 years, Yukon’s average temperature increased by two   degrees Celsius and winter temperatures increased by four   degrees Celsius. This increase is two times the rate of   southern Canada. This has a significant impact on Yukon’s   buildings, roads, power lines, water supplies and other critical   infrastructure. It also impacts the traditional activities and   culture of Yukon’s First Nations as weather and wildlife   patterns shift.   The department’s dedicated team in the Climate Change   Secretariat is responsible for coordinating the Yukon   government-wide response to climate change, forming climate   change partnerships with Canada, First Nations, Yukon   specialists, researchers and other stakeholders and   organizations, coordinating climate change activities and   participation for governments and the public, and for   developing climate change policies and strategies. It is   because of these responsibilities that we are here today to   discuss the recommendations put forth by the Auditor General   and our responses to those recommendations.   The audit report contains valuable insight that will inform   how the Yukon government moves forward in our efforts to   address climate change and I look forward to being able to   discuss our current efforts with you today. The audit covered   actions, commitments and initiatives undertaken between the   period of July 2006 and July 2017. Over this 11-year period,   we know that there have been significant changes in the   understanding and the global response to climate change.   With the adoption of the Paris Agreement in December 2015,   there has been increased momentum internationally in taking   action to address climate change.   Nationally, Canadian jurisdictions worked throughout   2016 to create a national climate change action plan resulting   in the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and   Climate Change. The Yukon government was actively   involved in the development of the framework, participating   in the four national working groups to ensure the federal plan   met the needs of our northern jurisdiction.   As you know, Yukon became a signatory to the   framework on December 8, 2016. Since that point, we have   been working to fulfill the commitments made within the   framework. We continue to work on national working groups   under the leadership of the Canadian Council of Ministers of   the Environment, or CCME. The council is facilitating the   implementation of the pan-Canadian framework and we are an   active member. As a small jurisdiction, being involved at the   national level requires time and dedication, but is essential to   ensure national climate change work reflects the needs of   Yukoners, the reality of climate change impacts on our region   and the response that is needed to address this changing   landscape, which brings us here today to talk about climate   action in the territory and how we intend to improve our   performance going forward.   The audit report includes four overarching   recommendations that we will be discussing in detail today.   The Yukon government supports and has agreed to all four   recommendations, and work is currently underway to address   them. I will provide an overview of that work now, just   briefly.   The first recommendation is that the Climate Change   Secretariat, working with departments and other stakeholders,   should prepare a comprehensive territory-wide risk   assessment to help prioritize commitments to manage the   impacts of climate change. A request for proposals for a   government-wide climate change risk assessment has been   issued and submissions from interested contractors are   currently being reviewed. This work is expected to begin in   February and we are on track.   We have also taken the first step in a scoping exercise for   a territory-wide climate risk assessment. This will be     February 14, 2018 STANDING COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC ACCOUNTS 3-3      supported by the Northern Climate Exchange at Yukon   College’s Yukon Research Centre.   The second audit recommendation is that the Department   of Environment, the Department of Energy, Mines and   Resources, the Department of Highways and Public Works   and the Department of Community Services should develop   climate change commitments that are time-bound and costed.   Commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions should   indicate the intended levels of reductions.    Establishing commitments and targets is planned as we   work to develop a new integrated strategy to address climate   change, energy and green economic growth in Yukon. It is   integrative because the Department of Environment,   Department of Energy, Mines and Resources and Department   of Economic Development have been working together to   replace the Climate Change Action Plan and the Energy   Strategy for Yukon, both of which both which were originally   released in 2009. A plan incorporating these three areas will   align with a shift nationally and globally to support long-term   economic growth while developing cleaner energy, more   resilient infrastructure and reducing greenhouse gas   emissions.   It is also integrated because we have invited Yukon and   transboundary First Nations, Yukon municipalities, the   Inuvialuit, the Council of Yukon First Nations and the   Association of Yukon Communities to partner in the   development of the strategy. Working closely together in   partnership will allow a holistic approach to shaping the   vision of what climate change action, energy and green   economic growth could look like in the Yukon.   The first meeting of the partners took place last week on   February 9 and has set the foundation for the partnership   going forward. Work is also underway to help improve the   accuracy and availability of baseline information from proved   reporting to inform our work going forward. This includes the   establishment of robust greenhouse gas emissions data, as   well as the completion of two state-of-play reports related to   energy and adaptation in the Yukon.   In addition, a national working group led by CCME is   working to develop common metrics and indicators so that   outcomes and actions laid out in the pan-Canadian framework   can be monitored and evaluated.   The third recommendation states that the Climate Change   Secretariat should publicly report in a consistent manner on   progress made on all commitments and on the expenditures   associated with meeting those commitments. Methodology for   reporting will be an integral element developed with the new   Yukon strategy for climate change, energy and green   economy.   The methodology for evaluation of the new strategy will   be informed by evaluation expertise within the Yukon   government. It will also reflect the CCME process I just   mentioned, which is establishing metrics and indicators for   monitoring nationally. Also, new rigorous reporting and   evaluation requirements for 11 projects funded by Indigenous   and Northern Affairs Canada have recently been introduced   by the Climate Change Secretariat.   Finally, the last recommendation states that the   Department of Environment, the Department of Energy,   Mines and Resources and the Department of Community   Services should complete their work to carry out concrete   actions in a timely manner to adapt to the impacts of climate   change. This work could include, but is not limited to,   implementing recommendations from reports, making   information available to decision-makers and explicitly   incorporating climate change into directives, processes and   policies so that they’re integrated into the decision-making.   We intend to ensure clear milestones and target completion   dates will be established as part of the new climate change,   energy and green economy strategy.   This holistic approach to working with First Nations and   municipalities in the development of a new strategy will help   support the implementation of concrete adaptation action   across the territory. We have also established processes to   ensure information is available to decision-makers. In 2017,   we established two dedicated groups of decision-makers who   meet frequently to discuss pressing climate change issues with   the most up-to-date information available. One is a deputy   ministers committee on climate change and energy and the   second is a Cabinet subcommittee on climate change and   energy.   I should also note that the audit recommendations align   closely with the commitments in the mandate letter from the   Minister of Environment, which was issued in January 2017.   It directs the department to establish greenhouse gas reduction   targets, to accurately track emissions and report on   performance in relation to the targets, and to work with   colleagues to integrate risk assessments and mitigation actions   related to climate change in government policies, processes   and projects.   There are a number of other initiatives also underway in   response to the recommendations within the audit and I look   forward to speaking more about those today.   In closing, I would like to thank the Office of the Auditor   General again for all of their work. This audit is just one of 13   audits that have been conducted across the country.   In 2015, the provincial and territorial Auditors General   partnered together with the Office of the Auditor General of   Canada to start work to examine and report on the progress of   climate change actions in their governments. With the   majority of the audits now complete, auditors from across the   country are producing a summary, which provides a snapshot   of the key issues and trends that are common across   governments. This audit will help to produce a baseline for   future climate change performance audits in Canada.    As I have stated, the Yukon government has accepted all   four recommendations of the climate change audit. The   Climate Change Secretariat is encouraged to continue its work   to lead the territory’s response to climate change with this   review in hand, as it will help us to develop better policies,   processes and programming for future generations.   Mr. Moore: I appreciate the opportunity to be here and   speak this morning on this important subject. With me today   is Mr. Dennis Berry. Mr. Berry is the Assistant Deputy     3-4 STANDING COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC ACCOUNTS February 14, 2018      Minister of Protective Services. Protective Services has   responsibilities for emergency measures, wildland fire and our   building safety standards, all of which were identified in this   audit, and it’s good to have his expertise with us this morning.   We are here to provide an update on the progress of the   Department of Community Services from the December 2017   report of the Auditor General of Canada on climate change in   Yukon. The report states that Community Services’ key roles   and responsibilities in managing climate change include   “coordinating Yukon’s preparedness for, response to, and   recovery from major emergencies and disasters; ensuring that   building safety codes are applied and meet standards; and   reducing greenhouse gas emissions.” The report recommends   that the department carry out concrete actions to adapt to the   impacts of climate change.    At Community Services, we know that climate change is   affecting the length and severity of Yukon’s wildfire season.   The four emergency response branches within the   department’s Protective Services division share the common   goals of mitigation, prevention and preparedness for public   safety and community protection in response to wildfires.   Resources are now brought in earlier in the season, with   careful consideration to seasonal weather trends, and we   continually evaluate the necessity of their extension. For   example, in 2017, we extended the air-tanker contract from 75   to 90 days to accommodate for the longer fire season. In   addition, First Nation crews started one week earlier to   accommodate spring training, and one extra crew was added   for the season, with four additional trainee crew members   brought on to bolster our capacity.   As well, the department utilizes the expertise of an on-  staff climatologist, who works closely with a national and   international network to model and predict needs for long-  term operational planning and emergency response activities   in Yukon.   The department is also proactively preparing for wildland   fires by fostering a landscape fire management approach —   and I’m sure we will speak more about that over the course of   the day — where we are preparing for and managing the   threat of wildfires on multiple scales — from individual   homeowners to communities, to the broader landscape.   Landscape fire management provides a framework for   evaluating a fire’s effects, weighing the relative benefits and   risks of different scenarios, and responding appropriately on   specific objectives.    In the spring of 2017, the department completed the   Yukon communities wildland fire risk assessment   methodology project. This important pilot project means that   we now have a systematic way to evaluate community risk   under climate change scenarios, which can now be applied to   all Yukon communities.   Community Services’ Emergency Measures Organization   — I’ll refer to it as EMO — leads the coordination,   collaboration and cooperation of all Yukon government   departments and agencies involved in the preparation,   prevention and response to disasters and emergencies. Yukon   is not only vulnerable to wildfires, but also flooding,   earthquakes, extreme weather and disruption to our lines of   communication. The central role of EMO is to collaborate   with local communities, municipalities, First Nations, federal   departments, industry and volunteers to support emergency   management, readiness and capacity.   Along with a number of emergency preparedness   programs, EMO also facilitates access to emergency   information through emergency alerts of the Alert Ready   program on radio, television and websites, and in April 2018,   it will also become cellphone-compatible within the territory.    Climate change is altering the traditional emergency   response cycles, such as when and where flooding occurs and   the length and severity of the fire season and Community   Services’ Protective Services division is responding by   carrying out new concrete actions to adapt and respond to   these impacts. The report also recommends that the   department develop time-bound and costed climate change   commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.    Community Services leads the Yukon government on   federal/territorial infrastructure funds and is working with   Canada to establish the Investing in Canada Infrastructure   program — sometimes referred to as ICIP. A key objective of   this program is to support the reduction of greenhouse gas   emissions, to enable greater resilience to the impacts of   climate change and climate-related disaster mitigation, and   ensure that communities have the capacity to provide clean air   and drinking water infrastructure.    Community Services is currently negotiating with the   federal government to ensure that this program is used to   target projects that will yield the highest reduction of   greenhouse gas emissions, particularly investments in building   energy retrofits.    Yukon is also working with Canada to ensure that that the   parameters of this program align with the key actions   identified by the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth   and Climate Change. Under this program, Yukon will be   working to contribute to a national 10-megatonne reduction of   greenhouse gas emission targets.    Disaster mitigation and energy efficiency are standard   considerations in the development and implementation of all   capital projects Community Services is responsible for   managing. These include site and geotechnical work to inform   design specifications with regard to risks such as permafrost   conditions and flood events. Buildings are designed to meet or   exceed our value standards derived from the National   Building Code of Canada.    As the key department within the Yukon government   responsible for emergency preparedness and response and   major capital infrastructure development, Community   Services supports the recommendations as outlined in the   Auditor General of Canada’s report.    In aiming to adapt to climate change and reduce   greenhouse gas emissions, the Department of Community   Services regards both coordinated emergency and   infrastructure planning as essential.    I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for   being here to speak and to thank the Auditor General. It has     February 14, 2018 STANDING COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC ACCOUNTS 3-5      been a very productive and cooperative process. I look   forward to this discussion today.    Mr. Pitfield: Good morning. I’m Jaime Pitfield and I’m   the Deputy Minister of Highways and Public Works. I would   like to introduce my two colleagues — Kevin McDonnell,   who is corporate ADM at Highways and Public Works, and   Scott Milton, who is the acting assistant deputy minister for   Property Management.    I’m here today to assist in responding to the report of the   Auditor General of Canada to the Yukon Legislative   Assembly, 2017 — Yukon’s response to climate change.   Within the Department of Highways and Public Works’   mandate lies the responsibility for Yukon’s highway network,   government-owned and -leased buildings, procurement and   fleet vehicles, all of which have climate change implications.    Government of Yukon is working to reduce the effects of   its energy consumption and we’re doing this by improving the   energy efficiency of government buildings, investing in   renewable energy for government operations and by   encouraging those within our sphere of influence to reduce   greenhouse gas emissions. Most of government’s greenhouse   gas emissions arise from transportation and building   operations. These areas offer the most opportunity for   reducing emissions.    Highways and Public Works is working to reduce GHG   emissions by making our buildings more energy efficient per   square foot and by using vehicles that are more energy   efficient per kilometre. The department also encourages   employees to make environmentally responsible choices when   making purchasing decisions as part of the department’s green   procurement policy.    All Highways and Public Works climate change   commitments in the future strategy will be time-bound and   cost-estimated. GHG reductions will be assessed to support   prioritization and the decision-making process.    The department will continue to provide input and   support to the Climate Change Secretariat, which is leading   the Government of Yukon’s efforts to reduce GHG emissions   and adapt to the impacts of climate change. Highways and   Public Works looks forward to continuing collaborative work   with our colleague departments of Environment, Energy,   Mines and Resources and Community Services to ensure that   Yukon has a climate change risk assessment and a climate   change, energy and green economy strategy that includes   milestones and target completion dates that will support   government decision-making.   Mr. Mills: Thank you, Mr. Chair. Good morning to   members of the Committee. First, I wanted to just introduce   my colleagues here: Shirley Abercrombie, who is the   Assistant Deputy Minister of Energy, Corporate Policy and   Communications, and also with me is Shane Andre, who is the   director of our Energy branch. I am Stephen Mills and I am   the Deputy Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources.   The Department of Energy, Mines and Resources   reviewed the Office of the Auditor General of Canada’s report   on the Yukon government’s response to climate change. We   agree and support the Auditor General’s four overarching   recommendations. The Department of Energy, Mines and   Resources has dedicated resources and effort to meet our   commitments in addressing and mitigating the impacts of   climate change. We acknowledge that our original   commitments associated with climate change lack some of the   prioritization, assessment, evaluation and funding   transparency that would have improved the accountability of   government. We are confirming that work is underway to   address these outstanding commitments and the Auditor   General’s recommendations.   We are actively seeking solutions to fulfill our remaining   commitments. One of our primary responses will be the   development of a new strategy for climate change, energy and   green economy. This new path forward will reflect the needs   of all Yukoners and is being developed in partnership with   Yukon and transboundary First Nations, as well as   municipalities. Our first meeting was held last Friday. We   were pleased to start this important work with our partners.   We believe that the strategy will increase Yukon’s ability   to thrive in and respond to our rapidly changing environment   due to climate change. The recommendations from the   Auditor General’s report will help inform the development of   this new climate change, energy and green economy strategy.   I do wish to take a moment to highlight my department’s   successful actions taken to adapt to and mitigate climate   change. Our Energy branch has completed a number of   important initiatives that have made a significant and   immediate difference. This includes implementing the popular   residential and commercial programs offering incentives to   retrofit existing buildings to increase energy efficiencies and   encourage the construction of super-insulated homes.   We have piloted energy planning exercises throughout   Yukon communities resulting in five First Nations and four   municipalities working on their energy plans. These plans   identify energy priorities and projects specific and appropriate   to each community’s circumstances and needs.   Our microgeneration policy is generating high interest   and creating opportunities for homeowners to generate   electricity from renewable energy sources. Our department   developed an independent power production policy and is   working with ATCO Electric Yukon, Yukon Energy   Corporation and Yukon Development Corporation to develop   regulations, standards and purchase rates required for its   implementation.   The biomass energy strategy has opened opportunities for   exploring the sustainable use of Yukon wood for heating   purposes. One example of this is the Teslin Tlingit Council,   who embraced biomass technology by purchasing and   installing 10 boilers, thanks to funding from Government of   Yukon, Canada, I believe, and other sources. The First   Nation’s district biomass heating system will provide heat to   10 of its commercial buildings. The project will create six   full-time jobs and 17 part-time jobs and replace the use of   diesel fuel with a local renewable resource.   Internally, the Yukon government is exploring the   feasibility of introducing biomass heating systems into     3-6 STANDING COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC ACCOUNTS February 14, 2018      government infrastructure such as schools in Watson Lake,   Haines Junction and Teslin.    While the majority of our commitments and actions were   concentrated within the energy sector, the Department of   Energy, Mines and Resources did take action on other fronts.   We have conducted a risk assessment on the health of   Yukon’s forests and identified vulnerable tree species in light   of climate change. Our local food strategy is supporting the   development and growth of local food production and waste   reduction. We are also working with the Department of   Environment on a number of climate change research projects   that will better inform government decision-making, including   the regulating and licensing of resource development   industries. Examples of this work include our Yukon   Geological Survey’s work on the greater Whitehorse   permafrost characterization and working with the Department   of Highways and Public Works on the Dempster Highway   permafrost vulnerability study.   The mining memorandum of understanding established a   government-to-government relationship that enables the   Government of Yukon and First Nations to identify priorities   and work together to achieve concrete improvements to the   management of mineral resources in Yukon, and this includes   meeting our shared desire for environmental protection.    All of these initiatives are in some way helping to reduce   local energy demands, minimize greenhouse gas emissions or   mitigate the potential effects of climate change. Compared to   other Canadian jurisdictions, Yukon’s emissions are relatively   small. In 2013, Yukon’s total greenhouse gas emissions   contributed less than one percent toward the national total.   Our emissions may be small from a national perspective, but   we believe that every action can cumulatively help to address   climate change nationally and globally.    The Department of Energy, Mines and Resources, with   other departments, is actively doing its part to make a   difference and to address climate change. We see that our   efforts are showing some success, and we will continue with a   renewed commitment to address climate change issues that   affect us all.    Chair: I thank all of you for your opening comments,   so we will begin at this time. In paragraph 16 of the Auditor   General’s report, it says that: “Overall, we have found that the   Government of Yukon created a strategy, an action plan, and   two progress reports to respond to climate change. In   developing these items, the government took good first steps   toward providing leadership and direction for responding to   climate change. However, the commitments in the   government’s action plan and progress reports were weak and   not prioritized. In addition, deficiencies in the Climate Change   Secretariat’s reporting made it difficult to assess progress on   the government’s climate change actions.”    The first question would be: When did the departments   first become aware of their reporting deficiencies?   Mr. MacGillivray: I think I can start by saying that we   have been aware of some ongoing data issues with the   national reporting system for some time. The federal   government, through Environment and Climate Change   Canada and Statistics Canada, keeps a database of emissions,   and we knew from work that we were doing here in the   territory that this emissions data were grossly underreporting   emissions in the territory. So I think we have known for some   time that we have had issues. We have worked with Canada   for many years now, trying to get these deficiencies corrected.   We have actually used our own data in the absence of good   federal data to report on some of our emissions. I think that   progress has been made. The federal government came out   with new data about two weeks ago — a revised data set   around emissions. That has actually corrected to some degree   the differences between the information that we report on.   That is part of it; data is a part of the reporting piece.   Chair: So, Mr. MacGillivray, do you think then that, if   the data that the federal government has provided was not   accurate, it would be fair to say that other jurisdictions of   Canada may fall under this same problem?   Mr. MacGillivray: It is possible. We have focused   heavily on the Yukon. The deficiencies were heavily around   international — or primarily fuels coming in from Alaska for   us. Other jurisdictions wouldn’t have those same issues, but   they could have other issues.   I know that there were substantial revisions to some other   jurisdictions.    Ms. Hanson: Just to follow up, I think that the question   and the finding of the Auditor General focuses on the   Government of Yukon, its strategy, its action plan and two   progress reports. The Auditor General is clear in saying that,   although the government took good first steps toward   leadership in responding to climate change, there really wasn’t   anything done, and it is saying that the commitments in the   government’s — the Government of Yukon, not Canada —   action plan and progress reports were weak and not prioritized   and that is leading to the deficiencies in climate change   reporting, which made it difficult to assess progress on the   Yukon government’s climate change action plans.    I believe the question is: When did the departments   become aware of Yukon reporting deficiencies, not the   Government of Canada?   Mr. MacGillivray: As far as a point in time, obviously   it came out through the audit, during discussions with the   auditors. Over the course of time, there has been a climate   change strategy in 2006, an action plan in 2009, a progress   report in 2012 and a further progress report in 2015, so we   were identifying initiatives and reporting on those initiatives   on an ongoing basis.   I think the audit does identify that there were a number of   areas where there was progress made, although specific   prioritization based on risk did not occur and action wasn’t   undertaken on all the initiatives.   Chair: Thank you. In paragraph 27 of the report,   officials of the Department of Environment told us that, when   the department developed the action plan in 2009, it identified   potential commitments by conducting research and analysis.   The department then worked with other government   departments and organizations to identify actual commitments   they could make. We were told that, although some high-risk     February 14, 2018 STANDING COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC ACCOUNTS 3-7      areas were specifically identified through the research and   analysis, the commitments were based on whether they could   be done.   The question for the Department of Environment then is:   It appears the department focused on what could be done,   rather than what needed to be done, so does the department   still believe this is how Yukon should tackle climate change?   How were priorities determined?   Mr. MacGillivray: One of the filters that were used   when we were trying to identify actions was readiness to   actually undertake the work, but that was one-off. We did look   to best practices elsewhere; we did look to other jurisdictions   and work that was happening there to inform the projects that   we undertook.    One of the filters was whether or not we had readiness   and whether or not we had capacity to do the work in the   Yukon.    Going forward, this is going to be informed by risk   assessments we are doing that will provide us prioritization   among the various initiatives that are happening. We have risk   assessments happening, both looking at Yukon government   departments, identifying high-risk departments and initiatives   within those departments, and then we’re just in the very first   steps of developing a Yukon-wide risk assessment. We’re   scoping that out at this point in time.   Chair: Do you believe that this is still the best way for   Yukon to tackle climate change? Just to follow up on your last   question, what other departments have discussions taken place   with?   Mr. MacGillivray: The discussions occurred across   government, with all partner departments — the departments   in the room today, obviously, but others as well — Yukon   Housing Corporation and Education and others.    Sorry, the first part of the question?   Chair: I was curious — does the department still feel   that this is the best way to move forward?   Mr. MacGillivray: Our thinking on this has matured   — as a result of the audit and as a result of the work that has   happened under the pan-Canadian framework, we are taking a   more sophisticated approach at this point in time — utilizing   risk assessments, looking to working with our federal partners.   The federal government has actually implemented a   greenhouse gas emissions lens to much of the funding   programs they have put out now. Our approach has matured   over the course of time.   Ms. Hanson: Just as a follow-up to that, the witness has   indicated that they have been working with a number of other   government departments and agencies with respect to risk   assessments. I just want to remind members of the Committee   and witnesses, many of whom were here when the Public   Accounts Committee met on June 28 — at which time, we   were talking about issues with respect to another Auditor   General’s report and findings with regard to risk assessments   and transfer payment policies — that, at that time, the   Department of Finance indicated to the Committee that, as   part of the reorganization of the Department of Finance, there   was more of a focused central-agency role with respect to   fiscal policy and implementation, evaluation and establishing   a cross-government criteria for establishing these risk   assessments.   What role has the Department of Finance Economics   Fiscal Policy and Statistics branch played in the work, and is   anticipated to play in the work going forward, which you   mentioned in all your opening comments?   Mr. MacGillivray: I think there are a couple of things   that have happened. One is that we have tried to better   coordinate across departments through the deputy ministers   committee, and then a Cabinet subcommittee, where we have   effected departments involved on an ongoing basis. Finance is   part of those.   We also have the actual departmental risk assessment   within government, which will consider Finance. I’m not sure   if Finance is going to come up as one of the high-risk   departments, but they’ll be incorporated in that as well. They   participate both at the deputy minister and ADM working   group level, and then at the decision-making level with the   Cabinet subcommittee.   Ms. Hanson: Just as a follow-up, the intent, as we   understood it when the witnesses from the Department of   Finance presented, was that in order to have an evaluation   framework for Government of Yukon in terms of assessing   whether government programs had achieved the objectives   they set out, there would be this new reorganization to provide   that kind of direction so we didn’t see 18 government   departments and agencies developing wholly different risk   assessments, particularly in the common area of climate   change.   Mr. MacGillivray: I think that’s what is intended, and   it is still a work-in-progress at this point in time. I think what   is intended is that Finance is looking at a broader,   government-wide risk assessment versus — this is specific to   climate change and will feed into that.    Chair: Paragraph 28 of the report says: “In creating its   strategy and action plan, the government took good first steps   toward providing leadership and direction for responding to   climate change. However, we found the following weaknesses   in the 2009 action plan and the 2012 and 2015 action plan   progress reports:    “Milestones or completion dates were missing from 56 of   the 70 commitments…” — which is 80 percent. “In our   opinion, this absence of timelines would make it more   difficult to measure when progress should occur.   “Many of the targets related to reducing greenhouse gas   emissions did not include estimates of reductions in   greenhouse gas emission levels. Therefore, the government   would be unable to measure whether actions taken to reduce   these emissions were sufficient.   “The action plan and two action plan progress reports had   no cost estimates for meeting the commitments or the plan   overall. Including such information is important to   demonstrate the level of resources needed for   implementation.”   So how will Yukoners know that goals have been   achieved if there are no clear milestones or timelines? Maybe     3-8 STANDING COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC ACCOUNTS February 14, 2018      by the same token, why were there no cost estimates on the   implementation of the plan as well?    Mr. MacGillivray: I think I agree. The auditor was   correct in that many of the initiatives and the commitments   that were made in the progress reports and in the action plans   were not time-bound and costed. That’s something that I think   we have agreed is required going forward and will be   incorporated into the new more comprehensive strategy that   we’re developing.    Previous strategies really did focus on the Yukon   government and Yukon government’s initiatives and   emissions. This new strategy will be Yukon-wide and is   incorporating energy and green economy. There is a   commitment to ensure that we address those deficiencies in   this new strategy.    Chair: Do we know why there were no cost estimates   on the implementation of the plan?    Mr. MacGillivray: I can’t speak for all of the   departments involved, but I think that it was a matter of   coming up with some initiatives, and costing then became part   of the implementation. It wasn’t actually part of the target-  setting up front.    Chair: Paragraph 29 of the report says, “We also found   that from 2009 to 2016, the government developed   three policies and two energy strategies related to climate   change:   “The Energy Strategy for Yukon (2009) provides   guidance for producing, conserving, and using energy in   Yukon.   “The Green Procurement Policy (2010) incorporates   climate change considerations into the government’s decisions   on procuring goods, construction, and services.   “The Micro-Generation Policy (2013) allows individuals   and businesses to install electrical generation systems and   connect them to Yukon’s electrical grid.   “The Independent Power Production Policy (2015) allows   independent, non-utility electricity producers to sell electricity   to Yukon’s two public utilities through renewable energy   technologies.   “The Yukon Biomass Energy Strategy (2016) identifies   actions for developing biomass energy in Yukon to reduce the   use of fossil fuels.”   Will any or all of these policies and strategies be   incorporated into the climate change energy and green   economy strategy to be released in 2019?   Mr. Mills: I can speak to four of the ones that were   listed in the auditor’s report, but with regard to the green   procurement, I will leave that to my colleagues through   Highways and Public Works.   The energy strategy itself was developed in 2009, and it   had a number of initiatives in it, such as creation of our   microgeneration policy — things like that. I would say that   there are a number of elements of that energy strategy that   have been completed, and there is still work proceeding on   other aspects of it. It definitely needs a refresh, and it is an   important policy for our department and for the Yukon. When   I look at that, as well as the other policies listed in the Auditor   General’s report, such as the independent power production   and the biomass, we are having significant work on all those   fronts. They are very important with regard to decreasing the   amount of diesel use in communities, adding power to the   grid, and having private individuals being part of the energy   solution.   For those reasons, I cannot see how proceeding with   creating this climate change energy and green economy would   not have key elements of that and may be — I’m trying to   think of what the right word would be. They might get   reimagined as we move through this process, but they are   essential and we continue to implement these policies today. I   would say that they need to be part of how we proceed. We   have had some really good success with the microgeneration   policy. I probably don’t need to get into details here, but I can   if you want me to. We have had some really good success   with the independent power production. We’re working with   the utilities right now, as I mentioned in my opening   comments, but I think that these policies are showing some   success, but I think we do need to relook at those as well and   map out the next — whether it is five, 10 or 20 or whatever   number of years we need to.   Chair: Mr. Pitfield, did you have anything to add?   Mr. Pitfield: The procurement policy absolutely has a   place going forward and we would review this as part of   where the Yukon government goes with this strategy. We   have managed to complete a number of initiatives, either   successfully or they are still underway. There will be a place   for it.   Chair: Do you know if those policies and strategies   were within the scope of the examination by the Office of the   Auditor General, Mr. Mills?   Mr. Mills: All of these policies and strategies were   provided to the Auditor General’s office as part of this   exercise. Given that the Climate Change Action Plan   references the energy strategy, I believe — but at least the   energy strategy makes reference to how they are connected —   it would be a challenge not to at least consider how these   policies play with regard to how the government is   approaching climate change — whether it’s adaptation or   reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.    So they were all provided. I probably would leave it for   the Auditor General’s office to respond to whether or not or   how this was incorporated into their review.    Chair: Mr. Ferguson, did you have anything to add to   that?    Mr. Ferguson: We describe in the audit specifically   what we examined. We focused in on the commitments that   were made under the strategy of the Government of Yukon,   but certainly we also acknowledged that these various other   strategies and policies also were in place to complement that   overall strategy. But fundamentally, what we were looking at   was: What were the identified commitments and projects   under the overall climate change strategy? So that’s where we   focused. But again, we wanted to acknowledge that these   other strategies and policies that could impact on climate   change also existed.      February 14, 2018 STANDING COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC ACCOUNTS 3-9      Mr. Adel: Mr. Mills, I just have a follow-up on   question five. Just so I can be clear — all of the policies and   strategies above that were mentioned in paragraph 29 will be   completed and/or added to the strategy of 2019, so we can   expect — if we ask for a follow-up on that as to how and   when they will be implemented and what they will be before   2019.    Mr. Mills: I think my comment is that none of these   policies sort of have a deadline or an end date on them. To   me, the energy policy that I referenced has some — a number   of the tasks are completed. So we would see that we need to   — as we develop this new strategy, developing sort of how we   proceed with energy in the future needs to be a component of   this plan.    With regard to the microgeneration policy, IPP — I mean,   for the independent power production policy, for example, we   had the policy in place, but we’re dealing with the   implementation aspects. Our goal is to be able to complete   that work and be able to go and have independent power   producers applying and coming in at the end of this year. We   will report back on that at any point, but that is a goal that we   have.    With regard to biomass strategy — I mentioned the   microgeneration — we’re going to continue because these   policies — as I mentioned with Teslin Tlingit Council — on   biomass and others as well as with microgeneration — when   you look around communities and the individuals — plus we   have a number of First Nations that have projects under the   microgeneration policy. This is an ongoing document and   these policies will exist. I think they will be components of   any comprehensive policy going forward. They are   implementation steps and they may need some revision when   we finalize the climate change energy and green economy   strategy, but these are key initiatives and we continue to   implement them, and we will until such time as this other   strategy is completed.    I hope that answers the question.    Mr. Gallina: Mr. Mills, it sounds like any current   policies or strategies built into the 2019 strategy would be   identified as current policies or strategies. I think that’s what I   hear you saying.    Mr. Mills: That’s correct, Mr. Chair — and in a much   more efficient way than how I answered it previously. Thank   you.    Mr. Gallina: Welcome, Michael Ferguson and Casey   Thomas. Thanks for the opportunity to be with us, the deputy   ministers and departmental staff.    I’m going to cover off three categories that are primarily   dedicated to the Department of Environment and the Climate   Change Secretariat. I would like to talk about the status of the   work started in 2016, the status of the risk assessment, and the   status and details of the 2019 strategy.    The recommendation at paragraph says: “The Climate   Change Secretariat, working with departments and other   stakeholders, should prepare a comprehensive, territory-wide   risk assessment to help prioritize commitments to manage the   impacts of climate change.” The secretariat agreed with this   recommendation and said, in response: “The Government of   Yukon is already planning a climate risk-management   approach for its own operations. In 2016, the Department of   Environment was directed to work with government   departments to integrate risk assessments and mitigation   actions related to climate change in government policies,   procedures, and projects. A climate risk assessment contract is   under way, and this information will support high-risk   departments to develop ‘climate risk reduction plans,’   including an implementation and monitoring plan. It is   anticipated that this work will be completed in 2019. Portions   of this work will inform government commitments in a new   climate change, energy, and green economy strategy planned   to be released in 2019.   “The Government of Yukon will work to complete a   Yukon-wide climate risk assessment to help Yukoners   prioritize actions that will address the most significant current   and expected impacts of climate change. The climate risk   assessment would explore specific areas of vulnerability to   climate hazards and recommend priority areas for risk   reduction.”   My first question is: What is the status of the work that   was started in 2016 with government departments to integrate   risk assessments and mitigation actions related to climate   change into government policies, procedures and projects?    Mr. MacGillivray: It is still definitely a work in   progress. Since 2016, there has been a significant amount of   work that was put into participating in the pan-Canadian   framework. The development of that — we participated   heavily in all four working groups. That was a fairly major   focus of our work during that time.    As a result, the federal government is providing   significant funding to the territories and provinces on an   ongoing basis, or a go-forward basis. Much of those funding   envelopes are still rolling out. But there has been a climate   lens that has been incorporated into those projects where   projects are required to take greenhouse gas emissions   reductions into account and to report on those on a go-forward   basis.    We have more recently incorporated that climate lens as   well around some of the work that we’re doing in partnership   funding through INAC. We have received $1.7 million over   four years to fund a number of adaptation projects, and many   of them are directly related to risk. Right now we have a   project underway on permafrost assessment for Yukon   government buildings by HPW. There is mapping   vulnerability of the Dempster Highway to thawing permafrost,   and that is HPW and Energy, Mines and Resources. There is   characterizing permafrost in the Whitehorse area — a number   of departments are involved in that one — and monitoring and   planning for the health impacts of extreme events through   Health and Social Services and Community Services. It is   something we are working on and it is something we are   incorporating into the new strategy. It is still a work-in-  progress.   Vice-Chair: Do any other departments wish to speak to   efforts being made since 2016? I am opening up the floor to     3-10 STANDING COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC ACCOUNTS February 14, 2018      any departments that want to speak to actions that have taken   place toward the 2016 mitigation?   Mr. Mills: Thank you, Mr. Chair. Given the number of   areas under Energy, Mines and Resources — just some   references to the fact that we are continuing to take action as a   regulator, but also the fact that we participate in   environmental assessments on significant projects — both   small and large — we continue to include climate change   considerations in our project permitting, but also in how we   participate within YESAA. YESAA has also developed   certain guidance documents that we have participated in, in   the past development, that helps to set certain standards for   proponents. So we continue to do that work. One of the things   we do look at is how project emissions could contribute to   climate change and its effects on the environment.   Again, consistent with that, some of the things we look at   and provide regulator and expert advice or input on is to   consider things, such as when there is potential permafrost —   with proponents, there are obligations with how they design   their tailings or waste-dumps and other things that are there.   How do you deal with the permafrost if it’s there, how do you   deal with other conditions? Also, very much so, is there are   some changes when you’re building the infrastructure on how   to handle significant events, such as the one in 100 and one in   200, and so on, with the floods and other events.   With our department — just probably at a high level —   we are working through our geological survey. We have done   climate change hazard mapping for seven communities, I   believe. These have been important planning tools and were   developed under a six-year project led by the Northern   Climate Exchange and Yukon Geological Survey.   We continue to include climate change considerations in   our planning exercises. We have the larger regional planning   exercises, of course, that we are all well aware of, but also we   have a number of local area planning exercises that are   underway with communities. The issues of climate change are   all considered — for example, factors like flooding, forest   fires, growing seasons, melting permafrost and the potential   impact on infrastructure. All is information we put into the   planning exercises with our local partners.   Our Agriculture branch does modelling for climate   change in relation to soil and water, as well as crops. They do   permafrost analysis when it comes to land applications, when   we’re trying to determine land that can potentially be put out   for agricultural development.   Those are some examples of the work that we continue to   do as a department, Mr. Chair.   Mr. Pitfield: Thank you, Mr. Chair. I would just like to   point out that our functional business planning does address   risk management and risk mitigation. In some areas we’re   doing it better than others, but I can give you some examples.   As a result of the 2017 audit on capital asset management, we   put in place a review and assessment of the impact on   buildings of permafrost. Out of 102 buildings, we have   reviewed 63; the rest will be completed by April.   For each of those buildings, where necessary, we will be   developing a risk mitigation plan.   As part of project planning and project approvals, we also   review permafrost and the impact of that on roads and   highways. When we look at designing projects for buildings,   for culverts — that kind of thing — climate change impacts   are part of what we’re addressing. We need to be more   systematic about how we do that, so that we can tell the story   and so we have the data to report on it. We do have data; we   just don’t manage it as well as we need to.   It’s a work-in-progress, but much progress has been   made.   Mr. Moore: Community Services has a number of   initiatives that address this question, and I’ll just break it   down into a few of the key areas. I mentioned some of this in   my opening statements. With respect to building codes and   building standards, our team is actively involved with their   counterparts across Canada. We actually sit on a number of   advisory panels that work to develop future building codes   that relate to how requirements will be developed to increase   insulation ratings, for example. Recently, in the last couple of   years, we adopted section 9.36 of the National Building Code.   This sets a minimum requirement that must be met for   insulation ratings for all new construction of residential   buildings. Through the services of the Building Safety and   Standards folks, we’re actively working around residential and   commercial building codes to ensure that emissions are   controlled in that respect.   Another area we’re involved in that was noted is around   our solid-waste operations. Our solid-waste operations have   evolved significantly since 2009, when the Yukon Solid Waste   Action Plan was released. There have been a couple of   updates over the years to that. The biggest change perhaps   was in 2011, when the open burning of solid waste ended, and   we have continued since then to move toward a transfer   system where we’re able to control and monitor more of the   waste that goes into the rural facilities and bring it to a central   facility where it’s monitored and dealt with and controlled in a   more environmentally friendly way.   We continue to improve and work on our solid waste   programs. In 2017, the new beverage container regulations   came into force. We have worked closely with the Department   of Environment and are currently working on proposed   amendments to the designated materials regulations. It’s an   active initiative. We just recently conducted a public   engagement on the proposed amendments and we anticipate   this first phase of the regulation — which will include tires,   electronic and electrical products — to come into force shortly   with the potential of more products to be added in the future.   I raise that because I think diversion with respect to solid   waste is one of the key initiatives that we were working to   improve. We’re working with our municipal partners and our   community partners, folks involved in transportation and   others in the recycling industry, to improve that process across   the territory.   We have also continued to fund important community   initiatives, including Raven Recycling’s zero waste campaign,   and we do continue to subsidize both the local recycling   processors — that’s Raven and P & M — through the use of     February 14, 2018 STANDING COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC ACCOUNTS 3-11      diversion credits. Our attempts to work on improving are very   active, and right now we have a ministerial subcommittee on   solid waste that is made up of our municipality partners. We   expect to see a report from them over the next several months,   which we’re very excited about because, by working together   with our municipal partners, we hope we can bring that   forward in a way that’s going to work for everyone across the   territory.   Moving on, I mentioned some of this in my opening   statement, but I think it’s worth noting, because it’s a huge   initiative: the ICIP — the Investing in Canada Infrastructure   Plan. It will identify about $600-million worth of   infrastructure funding coming into the territory over the next   decade. There’s a tremendous opportunity with this. As I   noted, much of the outcomes and reporting will be with   respect to a reduction of greenhouse gas and adaptation to   climate change.   Right now, those negotiations are actively happening. In   Yukon, we have identified that building energy retrofits is one   of the items that would have the most significant impact, and   we’re working very hard with our colleagues in the federal   government to make sure there is funding available to help   Yukoners — residential, commercial and institutional — to   improve energy efficiency.   I’ll talk about some of the programs we’re building.   Through the infrastructure programs, we have in the past, and   we continue, to build significant amount of local   infrastructure, whether it’s water treatment plants, waste-water   plants, solid-waste improvements, as I mentioned. I just   wanted to give you an example of one we’re currently   working on, which is Dawson City’s drinking water treatment   facility. It is slated for construction this year.    Much work has been done to ensure — and this is both at   the municipal council’s initiative, as well as what we are   hoping to work with, as I mentioned, with this fund. The   billings envelope will be designed to meet or exceed all of the   RSR values in the national energy code. We are installing   photovoltaic panels for solar-powered generation on the   south-facing roof to offset power needs. These are just   examples. We are working to really find adaptation in all of   our infrastructure projects.   Another example that I’ll give is also happening in   Dawson. We are replacing a significant amount of in-ground   piping — water-sewer piping — and we are moving to use   what they are calling “super pipe”, which is designed to be   more flexible to prevent breakage due to permafrost melting.   It is just more flexible.    Our engineers are looking at those opportunities and   learning what is happening across Canada. We are actually at   the forefront of some of that, working with some of our   partners here in the territory.   Mr. Gallina: In follow-up, what role is Environment   playing in assessing this data compiled from departments   related to climate change risk assessment mitigation efforts?   Mr. MacGillivray: The Department of Environment is   actually coordinating and collaborating with the other   departments. We have two climate risk assessment projects   underway. The first is a government-wide climate change risk   assessment, and an RFP has been issued. We expect to have   work actually starting by the end of this month.   This isn’t going to result in an actual report back to us   until 2020, but we do expect to have inputs prior to that. By   the end of 2018, this assessment is going to screen all Yukon   government departments for climate change risks and is going   to produce a report that identifies key areas of risk exposure.   Not all departments are going to have the same level of risk.   By early 2019, this assessment is going to analyze the risk   exposure and vulnerability of specific high-risk departments   identified in the screening and then produce a report for each   of those departments. These are going to be compiled,   compared and evaluated in a bit of a synthesis report — the   details, the climate risk exposures and vulnerability of the   Yukon government as a whole. This is going to help to inform   our Yukon-wide risk assessment, which is the second piece.   Do you want me to talk about that one as well?   Mr. Gallina: We will get into that. I have questions on   that specifically.   Ms. Hanson: Just as a follow-up, I would like to — in   their opening comments, the witnesses for EMR and   Community Services alluded to a couple of examples of risk   assessments. I think it would be helpful — I will go back to —   Community Services said in the spring of 2017 — Mr. Moore   said that the department completed the Yukon communities   wildland fire risk assessment methodology project. This   important pilot project means that we have a systematic way   to evaluate community risk under climate change scenarios,   which can now be applied to all communities.   The question I would have is: Is it being applied, when   will it be applied and what do these risk assessment scenarios   and the evaluation process — is there a common assessment   process, and when would you expect to be applying this   methodology?    It relates to a second question that I have for EMR, which   said, in the opening comments, that we have conducted a risk   assessment of the health of Yukon’s forests and identified   vulnerable tree species in light of climate change. The   vulnerable species, climate change — go back to 1997 —   what is different about this one, and what is being done with   this risk assessment on the health of Yukon’s forests? How is   it materially being utilized — or will it be utilized — in terms   of the management of Yukon’s forest resources? So, first to   Community Services — because they are both related to trees.   Mr. Moore: I will pass it on to Mr. Berry, who does   have some more specific answers that he can provide on this   question.   Just to answer some of the higher level pieces, it was a   project that just started, and it will be available across the   territory. Carmacks is the only community so far that has   piloted it but, through our EMO, it will be used as we develop   emergency plans for all communities across the territory. It   will be available, as it is fairly recent — last spring — but it is   intended to be actively available both through our emergency   measures and through Environment in some of the work that     3-12 STANDING COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC ACCOUNTS February 14, 2018      they are doing as well. It will feed into the 2019 report, of   course.   With that, I will pass it over to Mr. Berry to answer some   specific questions about it.   Mr. Berry: What I would say is that, currently, wildfire   management — the impact of climate change has been well-  known since about 1985. We are part of a national working   group called the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. We   sit on the science and technology committee. We’re actually a   core member of that group. That is specifically looking at   prevention and mitigation of wildfire management practices as   we adapt to changing climate.   We currently, of course, do model fire behaviour already   and we map — this is our partnership with the Forestry branch   — and as you’ve noted, there are a number of inter-connected   departments here from a whole-government approach. When   we’re dealing with forests, it is the Forestry branch that we are   aligned with largely. Sometimes they are the driving partner.   When it comes to forest fire modelling, that falls to us.    The methodology project is actually, from our   perspective, leading nationally. We’re beta testing it here. We   used Carmacks as the example. That is our forward-looking   program to identify how changing climate and climate species   are going to impact fire behaviour and what mitigation   activities we may need to take in order to adapt to that.    Again, we are aligned closely with Forestry because   Wildland Fire Management, of course, is a first-response   service, whereas Forestry is a land management service. If   we’re going to move forward under these broader programs   — as Deputy Minister Moore spoke about — which was   landscape fire management — really, we’re going to need   participation from multiple sectors, including social license   from communities, in order to mitigate and adapt to those.    So what I would say is that we currently ran the   methodology. I do, as an example, have a climatologist — a   PhD in climatology — on staff, and I have done for over 20   years. We run meteorological centres across the Yukon — in   fact, they’re the largest weather system — that not only   predict locally, but we can predict at a Yukon level. Those all   feed into this methodology. Like I say, we’re beta testing it   right now to see its efficacy and to see if it is going to work   for us. We’re hoping it is. It’s feeding into the larger national   discussion that we sit on through CIFFC. So that’s where that   is.    Ms. Hanson: With respect to that, the timeline for   completion of the pilot project — in terms of its application in   the Yukon as a whole?    Mr. Berry: So the methodology has been completed.   They’re evaluating it right now. I’m expecting through the   new fire season we’ll evaluate, again, its efficacy and whether   it is working. Then we’ll roll that out by community as we go   forward. I can’t give you a precise timeline, but it is forward-  looking on the impact of climate change.    But to put it back to what do we do right now — and I   really do want to separate out what we do as a first-response   agency — we model currently. Wildfire behaviour — we have   a climatologist, we have fire behaviour specialists, we have   mapping of Yukon’s forest — we do that actively right now   and we have those for every community. This is a   methodology looking forward as a result of climate change,   but in terms of: Are we ready as a first-response agency? Yes,   we are. Are we prepared to fight fires in communities? Yes;   we have been doing it for 70 years; we’re absolutely prepared.    Mr. Mills: I think the question was related to —   partially, I think it was section 53. Well, my opening   comments first, of course, and then also it comes up in section   53 of the Auditor General’s report with regard to forestry.    There was a forest — the name of it — the vulnerability   and adaptive capacity of Yukon tree species to climate change   — it was a technical report that was done in 2009.   The consultant, or the expert, was Craig — I am going to   say this and spell it for the purposes of transcription services,   so that I don’t get a call later in the day. It is Craig Nitschke,   so we can all pronounce it whichever way we would like to,   but I believe it is pronounced “Nish-kee.”   The vulnerability assessment report was done. It was   important for use to note in this report — and we have looked   at this because it did stand in the Auditor General’s report. It   was one that we have done some looking into and I have   become very familiar with this report. This report — the   practices, research needs, everything that was recommended   — they came out with considerations, but it was actually not   prescriptive and where the Auditor General spoke to us not   fulfilling three of the four recommendations, they weren’t   actually recommendations that were in that report. It was a   vulnerability assessment and there were some suggestions or   thoughts of the author, but they didn’t come out as a concrete,   “Here are four recommendations that you should do.” I would   note that the assessment is useful because of the all the   background information. It did give us a good assessment of   the vulnerability of our forest resources. But some of the   recommendations — if I can respond to that, because I think   that is an important part of this conversation — I don’t know   if this is taking us in a different direction, Mr. Chair, but there   are some of the recommendations that I could actually speak   to — the challenge with the recommendations that were there.   Chair: We can actually come back to that further in,   Mr. Mills.   Ms. Hanson: I just wanted to clarify — because the   witness indicated that in his opening comments — we have   just referenced now a report is almost 10 years old — 2009 —   but the way I heard it being said was that the Department of   Energy, Mines and Resources have conducted a risk   assessment on the health of Yukon’s forests and identified   vulnerable tree species in light of climate change. My question   is: So what? Did you just do this report, or is this a 10-year-  old report and we’re just commenting on it in this statement?   Mr. Mills: Mr. Chair, the scope of the audit did cover   this period of time and so it did reference the report because   this report is also referenced under the reporting of the climate   change action plan, so it was listed. The assessment was done.   This report was done by Mr. Nitschke and we did use it. It   was helpful as we move forward. I would note that it is not   that we just sort of sat on it and didn’t move with this — and     February 14, 2018 STANDING COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC ACCOUNTS 3-13      maybe if I can just — based on some of the information — we   have continued in 2017 forward. We did establish permanent   sample plots in Dawson, for example, that will allow for   future monitoring, tracking of forest responses to climate   change.   In 1988 to current, we have been monitoring changes in   forest vegetation through permanent sample plots established   throughout Yukon. We are in the development of a forest   resource management plan for Whitehorse and the Southern   Lakes that includes a climate change component that includes   recommendations for adaptive management in monitoring   forest indicators.   In 2002 to current, we have an annual health forest   monitoring program so that we maintain an annual forest   health monitoring program that contributes to identification of   trends in forest pest incidences due to climate change.    We had conducted studies in 2013-14 related to the   mountain pine beetle in novel habitats, predicting impacts to   northern forests. So we did this study in collaboration with   UBC — the University of British Columbia — to identify   potential responses to Yukon’s pine trees. We also   collaborated with the University of Northern British Columbia   and the community of Teslin and with the First Nation in   relation to — in 2012 to 2016 — with regard to a study to   support future work, research and management considering   the risks of climate change in that area.    We currently have a very interesting project underway in   the Lewes-Marsh area related to a study on determining the   response of lichen growth to forest harvesting with   consideration to the effects of climate change.    In 2008-10, we worked again with UBC in a series of   focus groups on climate change in the Champagne-Aishihik   traditional territories. In 2013, the current forest indicators and   monitoring program in Dawson included adaptive   management approaches in response to climate change as   identified in the approved forest resource management plan   that we developed with the Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in.    We continued to 2015 — the current forest vegetation   inventories and timber supply analysis in Haines Junction.   That includes identifying changes in the landscape — and also   working with the Yukon Wood Products Association and   other RRCs and other groups as we look at silviculture   program establishment. Finally, we do work, of course,   around fuel-abatement projects. We’re doing some work in   the Champagne-Aishihik area.    So the report itself provided a very good basis for what   some of the threats are that we have. It does allow our   Forestry branch to work in cooperation, especially with First   Nations and local communities. We are sort of driven through   our relationship in chapter 17 and the importance of   renewable resource councils and the First Nations as partners   in looking at forestry management, harvesting opportunities   and so on.    So sorry that it’s a bit of a long list, but I just wanted to   sort of — that analysis — we have done a number of   additional studies and also implemented pilot projects and   projects throughout Yukon through our Forestry branch.    Mr. Gallina: On the risk assessment contract — I know   that some details have been provided already, but can you   provide more details on this? Who is conducting the risk   assessment specifically? What are the specific goals? When   will it be completed and how will it be utilized?    Mr. MacGillivray: I think I described, initially, the   departmental or the Yukon government risk assessment that   was happening — that is happening looking at the work of the   Yukon government. We have just actually started a scoping   exercise around a Yukon-wide climate risk assessment. So   what this is going to do — it is a larger scope than the   government-focused climate assessment. We’re beginning this   work with a scoping exercise, as I’ve said, which is going to   better define the resources required and the methodology that   is most appropriate for a Yukon-wide assessment.    So that methodology has not yet been determined. We’re   actually going out and seeking expertise to help us with that.   This work is going to be undertaken in collaboration with   researchers at the Yukon College’s Northern Climate   ExChange. It’s going to help us understand the scale of the   work necessary in order to best prioritize actions to address   the most significant and expected impacts of climate change   facing Yukoners.    Once the scoping exercise is completed, then we’ll begin   the work to procure a contractor to undertake this territory-  wide assessment. Whatever possible preliminary information   from both the departmental — the government assessment and   the territory-wide assessment are going to feed into the new   climate change, energy and green economy strategy   development.    So we’re not going to wait to try to incorporate some of   this information in. Wherever possible, we’ll be incorporating   that in along the way. Does that make sense?    Mr. Gallina: Is the scoping exercise being done   internally or have we hired a contractor for that?    Mr. MacGillivray: The college’s Northern Climate   ExChange is going to do that for us or with us.    Mr. Gallina: So there were tender documents that were   released in January 2018 when departments knew of the need   — sorry, why were the tender documents released in January   2018 when departments knew of the need to improve climate   change actions and that the course of the action had been   agreed upon months before?    Mr. MacGillivray: So the 2018 RFP that went out was   for the departmental work. This was just a matter of the work   that was required to pull together that RFP.    Mr. Gallina: Okay. Moving on to the 2019 strategy —   so when in 2019 will the strategy be released?    Mr. MacGillivray: So the strategy — it’s almost a   two-year development process. We have taken an approach   where we are working with partners on this. This is not going   to be a solely Yukon-government strategy. This is a strategy   that we’re developing with our partners. So we have only just   had our first meeting. Final deadlines for completion will be   developed with partners as we move forward. So we don’t   actually have a firm, hard date at this time. We know that   2019 is the target.     3-14 STANDING COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC ACCOUNTS February 14, 2018      Mr. Gallina: At this point, are we expecting it to be   released in 2019?   Mr. MacGillivray: We are expecting 2019 as the   completion date — yes.   Mr. Gallina: Can you provide more detail on the work   being undertaken on the strategy — specific?   Mr. MacGillivray: I could provide more detail, but   Ms. Burrows is actually leading the initiative, and I will hand   it off to her.   Ms. Burrows: The three departments that are leading   this integrated strategy — those are Energy, Mines and   Resources, us at Environment, and Economic Development —   have been working on establishing the process and what this   new integrated strategy will look like. This is a new approach   for us, of course. The climate change strategy and the energy   strategy were separate previously. Now bringing in Economic   Development really reflects the change at a national level to   look at the transition to a low-carbon economy.   So where are we? In fall of 2017, letters were sent out to   First Nations, municipalities, the Inuvialuit, the Association of   Yukon Communities and the Council of Yukon First Nations   to come join us in partnering this strategy at a very early   stage. We are just starting to establish what that partnership   will look like and the foundations for that. As was mentioned   earlier, we just had our first partners meeting last Friday, and   that was really just an introduction to the process and the   strategy. Going forward, the partners will be helping us to   develop a public engagement strategy — what the key   principles and objectives of the strategy are throughout the   entire process until we release it in 2019.   Mr. Gallina: To clarify, who is taking the lead? Which   is the lead department — can you reiterate?    Ms. Burrows: All three departments are leading jointly   — Energy, Mines and Resources, Environment, and   Economic Development.   Mr. Gallina: Who do you plan to consult with as part   of the strategy? Have consultations begun?   Ms. Burrows: With this partnership approach,   engagement — although we are calling it a partnership —   with the First Nations and municipalities has begun, and then   public engagement, of course, will be part of that process, so   we are intending to engage with the public and key   stakeholders during that process.   Mr. Gallina: Has any of this engagement begun?   Ms. Burrows: No, working with our partners, the plan   for engagement is still to be developed in the coming months,   and engagement will start once that plan has been developed.   Mr. Istchenko: When you say “key stakeholders”, can   you highlight who the key stakeholders are?   Ms. Burrows: Sure. Of course, key stakeholders will   be what we sometimes call “subject matter experts”. In terms   of climate change, in terms of energy, in terms of economic   development, we will, of course, be engaging with Yukon   College, Yukon Energy and the Yukon Conservation Society,   but we will also be engaging with industry organizations as   well.   Mr. Gallina: The Yukon government has stated that   this new strategy will reflect the needs, concerns and ideas of   all Yukoners. How will you ensure that this will be done?   Mr. MacGillivray: As has been stated previously,   through this partnership approach and by not having this as a   government-only strategy — this is intended to be a Yukon   strategy — we are hoping to be able to bring all of the impacts   and the needs together into this document.    Mr. Gallina: I know that there has been some talk   about existing initiatives being considered for this strategy.   Does anyone want to speak to any new initiatives being   examined for inclusion in this strategy?   Mr. MacGillivray: I think it is premature right now.   We are taking the partnership approach seriously, and so there   really isn’t any kind of predetermined outcome at this point in   time.   Ms. Hanson: The recommendation in paragraph 31   says, “The Department of Environment; the Department of   Energy, Mines and Resources; the Department of Highways   and Public Works; and the Department of Community   Services should develop climate change commitments that are   time-bound and costed. Commitments to reduce greenhouse   gas emissions should indicate the intended levels of   reductions.”   The departments agreed with this recommendation and   said: “It is anticipated that commitments and targets in the   new 2019 Yukon strategy for climate change, energy, and   green economy will be supported by clear milestones,   completion dates, and associated costs. More rigorous   monitoring and reporting for Yukon actions would work to   support the actions and outcomes in the Pan-Canadian   Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change.   “The Government of Yukon will work to include levels of   greenhouse gas emission reductions anticipated to be achieved   in future commitments.”   So for each of the departments and the secretariat — I ask   these questions because the focus is often that we’re going to   do this in the plan in 2019, but we all recognize that we’ve   been talking about this since at least 2009. It’s important that   there be some recognition of work being done now and in the   interim.   What progress have you made on developing   commitments that are time-bound and costed? I would ask   that of each of the deputies.   Mr. MacGillivray: There has been a lot of reference to   the upcoming strategy and there are commitments to   incorporating the recommendations of the Auditor General in   that strategy, so there is work already happening there. We are   working, as I have said — all jurisdictions went through a   similar audit and the findings in the Yukon were not unique.   There were some common themes across the country.   This is something that is being dealt with through   working groups under CCME, the Canadian Council of   Ministers of the Environment, so we have good reporting at   the national level as well on the pan-Canadian framework. As   I mentioned previously, reporting really does come down to   having good data. If it’s garbage in, then it’s garbage out.      February 14, 2018 STANDING COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC ACCOUNTS 3-15      We have been working for some time now with the   federal government on the accuracy and availability of   baseline information. We have had some success; we have   brought the Bureau of Statistics into this recently. The Bureau   of Statistics is now under the Department of Finance. We’re   now using reliable Yukon fuel tax data and we have managed   to get so Statistics Canada is using that fuel tax data as well to   come up with the data on emissions.    As I said, this has resulted in a very recent revision that   has improved, although not fully corrected, the data from our   perspective. I think that’s part of this.   Ms. Hanson: Thank you and I thank the witness for   that. I would just remind you that the Public Accounts   Committee, in preparing for this, has thoroughly read the   Auditor General’s report and is apprised of the work of   Ms. Gelfand in terms of working across the country. There are   two items — you haven’t indicated how those are time-bound   or costed.   The cost elements — I am just looking for what progress   is being made on developing commitments that are time-  bound and costed.   Mr. MacGillivray: There aren’t any commitments   actually being developed at this point in time. The   commitments will be developed through the strategy. That’s   where the next series of commitments will emerge.   Ms. Hanson: There are no commitments with respect   to addressing climate action? Maybe perhaps you need to   reflect on that. I think that there are, from what I have been   hearing — that there are actions and activities being taken to   address climate change and mitigation in this territory by   government departments and agencies.   Are you saying that none of those are costed and they   have no time limits? Is that essentially what you’re saying?   Mr. MacGillivray: What I’m saying is that there’s a   difference, and I think this is an area that the auditors teased   apart in the audit — that there’s a difference between   commitments and initiatives. Commitments are just that:   they’re commitments for future reductions, for future   greenhouse gas reductions and/or adaptation initiatives.   We have a number of projects underway currently that   are, as you have said, having costs associated with them and   completion dates identified, but those aren’t commitments as   per what you would see under a strategy.   Chair: Mr. Mills, did you have something to add to   that?   Mr. Mills: I believe I do, Mr. Chair. I think the   question also is: What are we doing now? I just wanted to   speak to a couple of things. One is that, as we move forward,   there are various federal government funding programs that   are there, such as the low-carbon economy fund and other   ones. As we structure potential projects to fit within that, we   are addressing the issues of ensuring that they are time-bound,   as well as costed. So we are on a go-forward plan identifying   those components — plus prioritization of some of these   projects with regard to the potential reduction in greenhouse   gas emissions as a way to prioritize our own projects that   we’re looking at.   As we’re looking at projects, we’re doing that, but our   department also continues to deliver projects that are seeing   tangible results, such as some of our residential energy   incentive programs and commercial incentive programs. In the   last three years, we have seen 291 as our number of super-  insulated new homes that were built. We understand the   savings there — approximately $475,000 in energy costs, or   the savings, and preventing 203 tonnes of carbon dioxide from   being emitted.   I would say this is quite unprecedented for a small   jurisdiction that we have here.   For our home energy retrofits, we have had 1,126 retrofit   rebates issued to Yukoners in three years. These participants   have saved $126,000 in energy costs, preventing 264 tonnes   of carbon dioxide from being emitted. We have some 60   LEED retrofit programs that we have offered with savings that   we track.   When we look at all these different programs, our   numbers — and they’re accurate — show that, with all these   programs, we have saved enough energy to power over 1,600   homes for one year. Participants have saved over $7.7 million   in energy costs and prevented 33 kilo tonnes of carbon   dioxide.   We have a number of initiatives through our Energy   branch. We continue to deliver those projects. As we move   forward, we have to look at the strategy identifying clear   targets but, as we move toward that, we are tracking and   seeing the benefits that flow from these various programs.   I just wanted to add that information. My apologies if it’s   off the mark to your question, but I think it’s helpful   information.   Ms. Hanson: Thank you and I thank the witness for   that. What you have identified is that your department has   tracked a range of data. In identifying and expending   resources for those programs, were there any targets that you   were attempting to achieve? Not just the financial outlay, but   also targets with respect to diverting energy from fossil fuels   utilization or a reduction in greenhouse gases through other   means — what were the targets that you were attempting to   reach in expending the resources for these various programs?   Mr. Mills: For these existing programs, we don’t have   specific targets that we’re trying to reach with these   emissions. We are trying to reduce greenhouse gas emissions   — we are trying to do this — but we don’t have those specific   targets. When it comes to the new project — what we’re   looking at under, say, the low carbon economy fund and other   ones — in these particular programs themselves, we identify   the target of each of these sorts of project asks — to set that   sort of target as to what we want these particular projects to   do. We still need to look at the larger overall target of the   government, and that is one of items that will come as part of   our development overall. I would note that we still have, for   example, in the energy strategy, priority action targets such as   increasing energy efficiency in Yukon by 20 percent by 2020.   These are still identified within the energy plan, and, in this   case, should we meet the timeline, it would be taken through     3-16 STANDING COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC ACCOUNTS February 14, 2018      the identification of where we’re going with regard to the   climate change, energy, and green economy strategy.   Mr. Moore: With respect to the question in terms of   how it related to Community Services programs, perhaps the   best example is what we’re doing around the National   Building Code. I referred to that a little bit, to the work that   we’re doing on a national level. It is not necessarily time-  bound. It is just that we have a commitment to adopt the   National Building Code as it continually evolves — to take   the greenhouse gas reductions. New technologies evolve. So   we continually adopt that, but I agree that it is not time-bound   at this point in time. It is just a commitment to continue to   adopt that as those new rules roll out.   The other example I would use that is time-bound is the   commitment that will be under the ISIP, the Investigating   Canada Infrastructure Plan. It is a national commitment to   around a reduction of 10 megatonnes, and that is time-bound   in the next 10 years. The methodology and how that will be   reported is still in development and part of those discussions   with the federal government, but, once that agreement is   finalized and signed off, those reporting mechanisms will then   commit us to how we contribute to that reduction as we go   forward with our infrastructure programs in the territory.   Mr. Pitfield: In terms of the 70 commitments made in   2009, 18 of them applied to Highways and Public Works, and   on all of these, work has progressed. Some of our   commitments were time-bound and some were not. Some did   have targets and some didn’t. All were costed as part of their   implementation. I would say that, in terms of energy-  efficiency projects — and this would apply Yukon   government-wide — where savings pay for the investment,   those would have been costed very carefully beforehand.   We have successfully completed some of our   commitments; others continue. In terms of the strategy to   come, many — if not most of it — would be rolled forward   because they are all valid approaches to climate change   reduction.   Ms. Hanson: I thank the witnesses for their responses. I   had another question here with respect to these commitments.   When we were talking about it as a group, we talked about it   in terms of what impediments there might be to meeting   commitments. Given the Deputy Minister of Environment’s   comments, I guess the question should be rephrased: What   impediments are there to establishing commitments?   Mr. MacGillivray: I would say that primarily it is the   information required to have enough information to know   what is required financially to complete the commitment and   to have enough certainty around the greenhouse gas emissions   reductions to know what kind of reductions might result as a   result of the initiative. Those are a couple where the initiatives   fit within the broader priorities of government as well.   Ms. Hanson: As the lead department, what baseline   measurements does the Department of Environment have in   place to inform the 2019 strategy?   Mr. MacGillivray: As we have mentioned, we are   working hard to ensure that we have the best data possible and   we are working with Canada to do that, both with our Bureau   of Statistics and with Statistics Canada. We are ensuring that   we have risk assessments that will feed into these, both on the   departmental and the Yukon-wide basis. What we have done,   actually — because we’re bringing a number of partners   together to develop this strategy — is that we have developed   these two state-of-play reports. If you haven’t seen them, I   would encourage you to take a peek. There is one on energy   and one on adaptation, and it brings together much of the   science that we have currently so that everybody is starting on   the same page in the development of those strategies.   That reflects a good deal — as you’ve heard around the   room. The secretariat really does play a coordinating function   and the departments really are responsible for individual   projects and programs. Much of the expertise resides within   the departments with regard to the data and some of the   mitigations required.    Ms. Hanson: So just to confirm — that the state-of-  play reports essentially will form the baseline measurements   to inform as the starting point for the 2019 strategy?    Mr. MacGillivray: They are actually inputs. They’re   making sure that everybody is starting with the same basic   information — the basic understanding of what the impacts   are, what the risks are, what some of the challenges are for the   territory. So it has everybody kind of pointed in the same   direction.    Ms. Hanson: I ask that question because, yes, there is a   difference between the environmental scan and actual data. So   I was asking the question with respect to baseline   measurements that are in place to inform the 2009 — we’ve   been talking about this for almost 10 years so I was confused   there. It’s the 2019 strategy that we’re working toward.    Mr. MacGillivray: The strategy development is   happening within a broader framework as well. We have   Canada entering international, global commitments under the   Paris Agreement. We then have the provinces and territories   coming together with their commitments under the pan-  Canadian strategy. Then, nested under that is our own   strategy. These all kind of build up to meet Canada’s   commitments internationally.    Ms. Hanson: One of the questions we have is: How   will the departments work together to achieve their time-  bound and — when they establish them — costed   commitments to reducing greenhouse gas emission levels, and   what accountability mechanisms are anticipated to ensure that   they are achieved?    Mr. MacGillivray: So as I’ve said, these are still very,   very early days as far as how we are going to be doing this.   There are subcommittees that are meeting nationally under the   CCME frame. There are committees specifically meeting on   metrics and monitoring so that we — I mean, obviously, all   provinces and territories. There’s a benefit if we’re all   measuring and reporting in a similar manner so that it’s more   easily compiled into a Canadian contribution to our   commitments under Paris.    So there is a whole lot of work that is happening at the   provincial and territorial level. Then, within the territory,   based on those metrics that become best practices across the     February 14, 2018 STANDING COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC ACCOUNTS 3-17      country, we will be working with our partners to try to feed   into that.    Ms. Hanson: The question was focused on the Yukon.   Do you anticipate accountability mechanisms to be built into   the Yukon’s time-bound and costed commitments to reducing   greenhouse gas emission levels?    Mr. MacGillivray: I think we do expect or we do   anticipate at this point in time that the commitments that are   made in our new strategy will be time-bound and costed, and   they will identify estimates of the greenhouse gas emissions   that will be established up front, and then it’s a matter of — as   long as we have regular reporting on that, I think that is the   accountability mechanism.   Ms. Hanson: The government’s response to the report   indicates that there will be clear targets for emissions   reductions. Will these be economy-wide targets?   Mr. MacGillivray: It is one of the areas that has   received, I think, a lot of discussion. Economy-wide targets   are more difficult for us in that we are a small jurisdiction,   with 38,000 people. If we have a single large development   occur in the territory, our emissions profiles change   significantly. That has, I think, fed into the decision   previously to develop sector-specific targets. I think that the   auditor, and rightly so, identified that the sectors that we had   come up with didn’t add up to what the Yukon-wide target   might look like. I think that is something we are going to need   to deal with going forward. I do envision that there are going   to likely be sectors that would add up to something that might   be Yukon-wide, but they are early days at this point in time.    Ms. Hanson: When and how will industry be consulted   on the establishment of targets?   Mr. MacGillivray: Business and industry will be part   of the strategy development, and, again, it comes down to us   providing them good information up front so that they can   understand what the potential impacts might be and the   requirements.   Ms. Hanson: Paragraph 43 of the report says: “We   found weaknesses in the Climate Change Secretariat’s   reporting on the government’s progress on its climate change   commitments:   “The action plan and progress reports used inconsistent   terminology. For example, one report referred to the same   commitment as both an initiative and an action.   “A reader could not easily distinguish the reporting on   commitments from the reporting on other projects.   “The 2015 action plan progress report did not clearly   show the status of progress made on individual commitments,   as was done in the 2012 action plan progress report.   “The commitments did not include the actual costs of   carrying them out.”   I guess my question is pretty straightforward: What   happens between now and 2019 to remedy these weaknesses?   Mr. MacGillivray: I think the auditor has helped to   bring these to the fore, and we have agreed that we are going   to address these going forward. We have a perfect opportunity   now, in that we are developing a new strategy. On top of that,   we have all of our partners across the country, provincially   and territorially, working to figure out how, what best matrix   and how best to monitor climate change. I think there is a   commitment going forward from here. I mentioned as well   that it’s in my minister’s mandate letter that there will be   targets established, and so this is something that we are going   to be developing with our partners over the next year and a   half.   Ms. Hanson: I just note that six years ago there were   costs with respect to the actions and the action plan. The   question was: What happens between now and 2019 to try to   at least get to that stage of having some data? What kind of   reporting will occur? Who will report and to whom? How   regularly will the Climate Change Secretariat report and make   reports public?   Mr. MacGillivray: Again, this something that is being   dealt with nationally as we all feed up into the pan-Canadian   framework. There is an interest in ensuring that, when   partners are identifying a reduction, it is a real reduction.    One of the things that we do is that we use an   independent third party verifier in the climate registry. We are   one of the few jurisdictions in Canada that actually does this.   We are the only jurisdiction that has our greenhouse gas   emissions verified and reported through the climate registry.   That is one of the things that we are going to consider, going   forward.   Ms. Hanson: I don’t think that the witness has   addressed the issue that I was raising. The auditor found that   the 2015 action plan progress reports did not clearly show the   status of progress made on individual commitments. I   understood earlier that the deputy said that there are not   commitments, but there were individual commitments. It was   done, however, in 2012. Those action plans — of the 2012.   The progress report did show status of progress.   My question was about — between now and when we get   the new strategy that is supposed to be done sometime in   2019, what kind of reporting will occur from the Climate   Change Secretariat on actions that are being taken? As we   have heard, the government as a whole is doing work not just   on greenhouse gas emissions, but on a number of adaptation   and mitigation efforts. What kind of reporting will occur, and   to whom will all of those reports be made?   Mr. MacGillivray: I don’t know if I’m following   entirely what you are looking for here. There were a number   of commitments that were made through a series of three   reports previously: the action plan in 2009, the progress report   in 2012, and a further progress report in 2015.    The progress report in 2015 did two things: it reported on   progress to date, and it also committed new actions going   forward. Those actions that are currently underway are still   continuing where appropriate, but we are now in a position   where we are developing a new approach to climate change —   a more comprehensive approach that incorporates energy and   green economy. I guess that is an outstanding question as to   what kind of reporting is going to continue on those previous   commitments.   Ms. Hanson: I hate to belabour the point, but the   auditor — and the departments agreed with the auditor’s     3-18 STANDING COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC ACCOUNTS February 14, 2018      findings — simply said — and I will repeat it: “The 2015   action plan progress report did not clearly show the status of   progress made on individual commitments, as was done in the   2012 action plan progress report.   “The commitments did not include the actual costs of   carrying them out.”   So, between now and whenever we get the strategy in   2019, does that mean that, since 2015 and to 2019 sometime,   we will have no idea of the costs of carrying out any of the   projects or commitments made under the action plan?   Mr. MacGillivray: No. I think what we’ve heard from   the other departments is that individual projects and individual   initiatives will be costed and will have greenhouse gas   emissions reductions, especially if they are being funded   through federal programming. The federal government has   implemented this new carbon lens that they’re applying to   their funding projects, so that will be occurring on an   individual project basis.   Broader sectoral commitments are not envisioned to be   made between now and 2019.   Ms. Hanson: Paragraph 43, as we started at the outset,   was with respect to the Climate Change Secretariat so, when I   had asked my question originally, it was: What kind of   reporting will occur? Who will report to whom? How   regularly will the Climate Change Secretariat report?   It’s in the context of what work has been ongoing, and   I’m trying to ascertain: Will there just be a vacuum of   information? There will be no reports made to the Yukon — I   can understand to funding sources, but to Yukon and   Yukoners — about initiatives and progress being made on any   of the work that has been done under the current aegis of   whatever plans are in place?   Mr. MacGillivray: That is an outstanding question   right now, to be honest. We have the strategy that was   developed in 2006, the action plan in 2009, the first progress   report in 2012, and the second progress report in 2015. The   next three-year period is 2018 but, because we are   transitioning into a new strategy — a strategy that is more   broad, that is Yukon-wide and that incorporates climate   change, energy, and green economy — there is an outstanding   question about what reporting will happen between now and   the completion of that strategy.   Chair: With that, I will recommend that we take a   break for lunch and reconvene at 1:30 p.m.      Recess      Chair: Thank you very much, everyone. I hope   everybody enjoyed their lunch.    We’ll get back to the hearing and carry on with Mr. Adel.   Mr. Adel: Thank you, Mr. Chair. I would also like to   thank the Auditor General and his Principal for being here,   and the Deputy Ministers and their staff as well. It always   makes these fun-filled meetings and a great afternoon ahead   of us, so I will get started.   The recommendation in paragraph 44 says — and I quote:   “The Climate Change Secretariat should publicly report in a   consistent manner on progress made on all commitments, and   on the expenditures associated with meeting the   commitments.”    The secretariat agreed with this recommendation — and I   quote: “It is envisioned that reporting systems, including   frequency, reporting language, cost, and established metrics   for each commitment or target, will be part of the new Yukon   strategy for climate change, energy, and green economy.”    This is for the Climate Change Secretariat: What progress   have you made in defining the nature and frequency of public   reporting?   Mr. MacGillivray: Thanks for the question.   Unfortunately, some of this ends up being things that I have   said previously — but the methodology for evaluation of the   new strategy is going to be informed by the CCME process, so   the national process that we have to establish metrics and   indicators. We also have some expertise within government   now and so we’re not waiting.    What we have done is, we have a number of projects that   we have funded this year under INAC funding — 11 projects   that we’re starting to use some of these measures in currently.   So we have good costing up front with clear timelines around   delivery of these projects and, where there are greenhouse gas   reductions, many of these are adaptation projects, so they   don’t actually have greenhouse gas reductions associated with   them. But we are incorporating some of those measures into   the projects that we are initiating now.   We have, as we have said, committed, through the course   of this audit, to ensure that we do have time-bound, costed   commitments and I think that is going to be developed with   our partners. We do envision that it will be developed earlier   in the process though, so it won’t be an afterthought. It will be   part of the development of the strategy and it will include how   we are going to report and how we are going to monitor and   how frequently we will report on the commitments that are   made.   Chair: Before I carry on, I neglected to mention that   Kate White is here this afternoon, filling in for Liz Hanson.   Thanks, Kate, for being here. Mr. Adel, please.    Mr. Adel: Thank you, Mr. Chair, and welcome, Kate. I   guess as a follow-up to that — what I’m hearing is that you’re   waiting for the federal government’s guidelines before we   start having a defined public frequency on reports and you’re   going to use those guidelines to form yours, or are you   forming your own outside of those, so we will get the reports   sooner than waiting for the federal government?   Mr. MacGillivray: Some efficiencies we have through   the pan-Canadian framework — all jurisdictions are working   on how to report through the pan-Canadian framework —   what to measure and how we are going to report reductions   and efforts that have been made. I don’t envision that we will   be creating a different wheel in the Yukon. We will be using   very similar metrics and so we’re getting past practices. We’re   learning from the work that is happening nationally and we’re   bringing that back to use with our own strategy here.     February 14, 2018 STANDING COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC ACCOUNTS 3-19      Mr. Adel: Okay. What progress have you made on   costing expenditures? Is there a metric that you’re using or is   it on an each-project basis?   Mr. MacGillivray: Currently, with the initiatives that   we’re undertaking — those are all costed up front. They have   a budget and we track costs against the budget.    What we envision with the new strategy is that, as   commitments are made, we’re going to be putting our minds   to how best to cost those up front. It’s going to be a difficult   process, to be honest with you, for some of the commitments   that could be made in a strategy like this — bridging climate   change, energy and green economy. But it’s something we   need to put our minds to, for sure.   Mr. Adel: Will you be working with the Department of   Finance and those — you have your overarching committees,   so they’ll be going through Finance as well?   Mr. MacGillivray: Yes, we will. As we’ve said, we   have a deputies committee. There’s also a working group   under that at the ADM level. Finance is part of that. Highways   and Public Works deals with much of our procurement and is   also part of that. We’ll be taking a broader approach with this   for sure.   Mr. Adel: What principles or guidelines will you use to   inform the public or with reporting to the public?   Mr. MacGillivray: We have learned through this audit   that we need to have consistent reporting. It needs to happen   on a consistent time frame and needs to be clear and   transparent. Those are some of the principles that we’re going   to be looking to incorporate.   Mr. Adel: The government’s response to this   recommendation and to the recommendation in paragraph 55   uses the word “envision”. The government says it is   envisioned that reporting systems will be part of the new   climate strategy. It also says that it is envisioned that it will   include milestones and target completion dates.    What stood out was the use of the word “envision” versus   something more concrete. “Envision” just means that it’s   possible, not that it will actually happen. Without a concrete   guarantee, it’s hard to see how the government is   appropriately responding to the Auditor General. Is it a   guarantee that the new climate change strategy will have   reporting systems, milestones and target completion dates?   Mr. MacGillivray: I think the wording that was used in   our response to the climate change audit was carefully   selected. It’s difficult today to absolutely guarantee that   something is going to happen. This was in 2017; it’s difficult   to guarantee that something is going to happen in 2019.   We also didn’t want to pre-determine absolutely, given   that we had envisioned that there was going to be a   partnership in developing the strategy. I can tell you, though,   that it’s one of our goals and objectives going into this, as the   Yukon government, to ensure that we have good reporting.   Ms. White: Just before we move on to the next point,   when we’re talking about the regular reporting, so the   progress report came out every three years — 2009, 2012,   2015 — and then the other departments also have regular   progress reports. One of the concerns that we have had and   that we have been trying to vocalize in a way that seems to be   getting lost in translation is that 2018 — so theoretically, we   would be expecting a progress report, as we did in 2012 and   2015. But everything right now talks about how we’re   developing a new strategy for 2019, and then it will take, I’m   guessing, two to three years to have the first reporting on the   new strategy. So that would leave us from the last one in 2015   to possibly 2020-21.    My question is, what kind of — I’m trying to find the   words here. How can we make sure — in our position, one of   the things that happens is that your ministers will present   progress reports, and that gives us, particularly from the   Opposition, the ability to go through what the commitments   were and what the stated goals were to say, how are you   meeting this? It’s not very often that I get to have the   department heads here able to speak, which is very exciting   for me, because you guys know your departments better than   anyone else.   My concern is that we’re talking about the strategy that   will hopefully — although no concrete timeline — sometime   in 2019, be ready to go — and 2019 is 12 calendar months. In   my head, I’m like, “December 2019, this strategy will come   out.” But what progress reports will happen until that point?   What is going to come to the Legislative Assembly? What’s   going to come to the public? How are we going to make sure   that we are still doing a check and balance? We can look   toward the future, which I don’t think is a bad thing, but if all   we’re doing it looking forward and we’re not paying attention   to where we are right now, heaven forbid we should have a   six-year period where there’s no reporting because we’re   working on the new strategy before we do the first reporting.   We have talked about developing the strategy. Based on   my limited six years’ experience, developing a strategy means   that there’s going to be a number of years before that first   strategy is reported on, so 2020-21 would be my conservative   estimate. What happens between now and then, as far as   accountability? How can the departments say that this is the   goal, so this is how we’re going to reduce our greenhouse gas   emissions, this is how we’re going to electrify the highway or   change the fleet vehicles, or this is how we’re going to do   hazard mappings in communities, if what we’re talking about   now is 2019 and forward?   I’m just looking for what the interim is. My last report   was 2015, and I have had different reports from different   departments, but I really want to know how I, as a person, and   how the public can follow along if what we’re just talking   about now is post the 2019 strategy?   Mr. MacGillivray: I understand the question. I’m   going to answer in a couple of different ways, though. What   the auditors in the audit report were telling us was that we did   not have a frequency for reporting identified in our actual   reports. It was our practice to report every three years, but it   wasn’t actually required within the documents. I think that   was the first thing the auditors had noted.   It was just our practice that we had 2009, 2012 and 2015.   That practice would lead you to believe that there would be   something happening in 2018. We have a new mandate and     3-20 STANDING COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC ACCOUNTS February 14, 2018      we now have a commitment to a new strategy. The point you   raise is a very good one. It’s one that I don’t have an answer   for, for you for today, as far as a broad progress report would   go, but I think you have correctly identified that individual   departments will be reporting on progress made within their   own programs, as they have previously. It’s just at this point   in time, I don’t have the answer for you around a broad   progress report.   Mr. Adel: Okay, that pretty well covered what my next   question was, so that’s pretty good. As a little follow-up,   though, my question was: What are you doing differently from   2015 — because the Auditor General looked at that report and   decided that we weren’t getting the information we wanted?   How are you going to fundamentally change your   departmental reports so that we get more concrete costs,   metrics and reporting?    Mr. MacGillivray: I think one of the things we’re   going to do is build that right into the frame of the strategy up   front. So by thinking about that while we’re building the   strategy, I think we’ll have a more robust system. So I think   that’s one of the things we’re going to do.   It’s envisioned that we’re going to have some sort of   frequency of reporting within the report — within the actual   strategy. So it will be clear that there will be a two-year or   three-year reporting cycle.    As I’ve mentioned previously, there is a whole lot of   work happening. We are not the only jurisdiction that is   addressing this currently. There is a whole lot of work that is   happening across the provinces and territories. We’re looking   at best practices as well.    In addition to that, we have processes that our federal   partners are kind of driving us toward to make us better at   identifying or using this climate change lens when we’re   applying for funding and projects. So some of that is built   right into some of the monies that we’ll receive for projects   and that we will be reporting back on.   So there is a variety of different things that are underway   right now that are going to, I think, improve the way that we   collect data, that we monitor and that we report.    Ms. White: Sorry, Mr. Adel. I was really eager. So this   will not follow the most recent question but it follows the   question I asked before.    One of the concerns that I have — and it’s not about   looking forward, because I fundamentally believe that we do   need to change track. What we knew before is not what we   know now and definitely not what we know will be happening   in the future. Reading the report from the Auditor General’s   office — and, of course, I’ve had the opportunity to go   through the reports that are referenced, just because of my   position — I guess one of the concerns that I have — so we’re   looking forward toward this new strategy sometime in 2019.   But the one concern that I have is the continuity — so the   continuity within the department, the continuity within the   government as a whole — because — I mean, it’s going to   sound really shiny when I talk about election cycles, but   election cycles affect government direction because you get   new mandate letters. I understand that sometimes, you could   have been going in one direction and then your department is   moving toward another one.    So part of what I think is fundamentally important based   on my conversations with each of at different points in time,   understanding that you’re the experts within your fields, is:   How do we ensure that you future-proof it? How do you make   sure that what you’re setting up right now is election-proof?   How do we make sure that the direction that you guys are   aiming for now — so we’re talking about — and I appreciate   that we’ve thrown the green economy into it, because we’ve   actually broadened the scope. So the next Auditor General   report that will come out in 2022 after you’ve reported one   time will have a broader — you know, we’ll need more tables   and more chairs and there will be more people here to answer   the questions.    But how do you as deputy ministers who are working   toward — because we’ve talked about how this is a multi-  approach to making this new strategy — how do we — or   how do you, I guess is the question — because I’m just going   to see it at the end — how do you make sure that it is being   future-proofed? How do we make sure that it is going to stand   the test of moving forward? Just because — like I said,   unfortunately, your work is affected by — unfortunately or   not unfortunately, depending on how you want to look at it —   election cycles.    So when I talk about the continuity right now of the   reporting, I have grown to expect them in three-year cycles —   occasionally two-year cycles from different departments —   but how do we make sure — because like I said, my concern   is that I am not going to have the information that I need to   take a look at what is happening between now and when the   new report is out.   How do you envision — especially that we have multiple   deputy ministers here and, of course, the lead of the   development — how are you future-proofing this new   strategy? How are you going make sure that, come 2021 —   that is the latest time that the new election can be called —   that we’re not going to be, “Well, actually we’re starting again   at zero and we’ll report to you sometime in 2023-24”?   Mr. MacGillivray: That is a tough question. As senior   bureaucrats, I don’t know that election-proofing is necessarily   our goal with this. I can tell you though that the approach is   being taken this time where we have strategy that brings in a   number of partners. It is bigger than the Yukon government.   We are one of many different partners in this strategy. I think   it is going to have the effect that you’re looking for. I think   that it is going to reduce the impact of the election cycle on   the ultimate product, because there will be others who are   buying into it — First Nations and potentially municipalities   — and it may change that going forward.   Mr. Adel: Almost done. Though it doesn’t feel like it   sometimes, we are actually here and my question is to help.   What are the impediments you are facing to move from   envisioning to “guaranteeing reporting systems, milestones   and target completion dates with the new strategies”? What do   you envision as we look to getting back to you down the road   in six months or so and saying, okay, how is it coming? What     February 14, 2018 STANDING COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC ACCOUNTS 3-21      do you see are impediments to that right now that we could   maybe work with and help you with?   Mr. MacGillivray: This is bigger than just the   Department of Environment and the Climate Change   Secretariat, but I think — right off the bat — data   deficiencies, data gaps and capacity. There is a variety of   things out there that we are going to need to re-jig our systems   and build some new systems to be able to ensure that we have   good reporting.   Mr. Adel: Paragraph 53 of the reports says — and I   quote: “However, we also found that although the Department   of Environment; the Department of Energy, Mines and   Resources; and the Department of Community Services had   taken some concrete action for 11 of the 18 projects, more   action was required. Our findings included the following:   “The Department of Environment developed a   bioclimatic ecosystem classification system and a field guide   for one of nine bioclimatic ecosystem zones in Yukon   in 2016. However, the Department had not developed field   guides for the other eight zones. Department officials told us   that the work required to develop these field guides was   extensive.   “The Department of Energy, Mines and Resources   conducted an assessment in 2009 of the vulnerability and   adaptive capacity of Yukon tree species to climate change.   However, it had not implemented three of the   four recommendations made in the assessment.   “The Department of Community Services produced   detailed community hazard, risk, and vulnerability   assessments between 2011 and 2016, aimed at helping Yukon   communities develop emergency preparedness plans for   potential threats. However, the Department had produced   these assessments for only eight communities in Yukon.   Department officials told us that they provide these   assessments to communities only on request.”   My question was: Why has Environment not developed   field guides for the eight zones?   Mr. MacGillivray: That is a good question. I can tell   you a little bit about what this was. These ecosystem models,   or bioclimatic reporting, deals with the link between the living   organisms and the climate. What we did is we actually applied   to Indian and Northern Affairs Canada for some funding. This   was a costly endeavor. I think there was close to $500,000 put   into this initiative. We completed the first of nine and, to be   honest, that was the money that was provided and we didn’t   have funding to go further and complete the next eight.   Mr. Adel: Why has EMR not implemented three of the   four recommendations?   Mr. Mills: Thank you, Mr. Chair, for the question. I   think I just got going on this earlier and then I was told to wait   for a while, so I am going to start this again.   With regard to the forestry assessment report — again,   this was a report that was produced in 2009 by   Craig Nitschke. It was important to note a couple of things,   but it is important to note, Mr. Chair, that the practices for the   research needs that were identified as recommendations were,   in fact, ideas or considerations in this report and they were not   meant to be prescriptive, especially within the Yukon’s forest   context. So what I do want to do is maybe just talk about the   three really quickly here, because I think it’s fair to sort of   point out why it’s a bit of a challenging report.    It’s a very comprehensive report. I’m not sure if I’m   allowed to use props in here, but it’s a really big one. I don’t   know. It has a lot of great information. The thing was that   some of the suggestions that came from the author were —   one of them was that they recommended thinning for   lessening risks posed by multiple disturbances. So they   thought that — they recommended thinning in all forms — so   pre-commercial, commercial and fuel reduction. So I do want   to point out that we do — in fact, thinning practices that have   been talked about — we do fuel abatement firesmarting   programs. So, in fact, elements of this recommendation are   part of the practice that we have with Community Services as   well.    The concept of going and doing thinning — when we   have, in our case, a very new and fairly low level of a forest   industry — is really challenging. The idea of people running   their fuel-wood businesses, for example, or collecting material   at this time for biomass all through simply a thinning exercise   — it’s borderline commercial at this point, or at least cost-  effective. So this recommendation, in our opinion, was really   based around a southern context of a much more mature forest   industry, not of something that would work effectively here.    We do thinning as necessary and, as we start to open up   — and I do believe there is a future growth in our forest   industry related to the biomass efforts and other efforts that   are there — that we will be able to look at other aspects, such   as thinning, on the margins of some of these productive areas   for our forest industry.    But it was a very challenging recommendation and, in our   opinion, it wasn’t — well, first of all, it wasn’t even a   recommendation — but it was a challenging suggestion by the   author, but it was one that doesn’t work within our   commercial — this idea of spending money — huge money   — on pre-commercial thinning operations sort of in our   hinterland and our forest resources is really a challenging   concept.    The second recommendation that was not — according to   the Auditor General — sort of followed, was this idea of   enrichment planting. So the suggestion of the author was that   we should do enrichment planting — so establish shade-  tolerant species of trees that are sort of in the understory of   our established forests. So currently we estimate — and there   are probably other folks — a minimum of $1,000 per hectare   when we’re looking at silviculture and planting. We have   28 million hectares of forest in the Yukon. The concept of   starting to try to plant shade-tolerant trees within our existing   forests is a challenge because, right now, we’re looking at a   silviculture program related to — as we cut areas, we develop   silviculture. There are issues about some real benefit to shade-  tolerant — actually, more fire-tolerant trees — when we’re   around communities. That’s maybe a different concept.    I would note too that our forest industry — we are a fire-  driven ecosystem here and we have almost — all our species     3-22 STANDING COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC ACCOUNTS February 14, 2018      of trees — whether spruce, pine, birch and that — some might   be marginal, but they’re all shade-intolerant species. So this   concept of doing some of this introduction is very challenging   and we think, again, that this recommendation was more of a   southern-based recommendation. This author has done similar   reports in British Columbia, other provinces, and all around   the world, but we think that it was not really a relevant   recommendation in relation to our forest industry.   A third recommendation that came forward that was   discussed was about the silviculture systems and the idea that   we would start to manage our forests and look at uneven age   systems. I believe, and I talked to our Forest branch, the   concept here is we have a forest — it might be 80 years old —   we’ll cut 20 percent and replant. Thirty years from now, we’ll   cut another 20 percent or 30 percent, replant and we start to   get different age structures within the forest. That is a really   challenging approach, given we are a fire-driven sort of forest   here and if — again, going back to the cost — with regard to   silviculture and how marginal the economics are with regard   to forest harvesting, it would be very challenging to try to   implement this type of recommendation — and there are some   other solutions that go.   Those are the three recommendations of the four that are   said through Energy, Mines and Resources that we failed to   implement. I have had to defend my report card before and it   has always been a challenge, but I think in this case, part of it   is just the nature of the actual — these recommendations   really are challenging and maybe it goes back to how you do a   peer review of some of these articles that end up having a life   that was now a decade old. That is something that we have to   look at.   I mentioned earlier — and it was on the record for   discussion — we are undertaking a large number of activities   with our First Nation partners and municipalities and other   groups and the Yukon Wood Products Association and others.   We have a large number of studies that we are working on to   come up with a viable forest industry. We are currently   finalizing the plans with regard to a silviculture program that   is going to work and that is Yukon-specific. We haven’t   necessarily been sitting on our hands and not implementing   these recommendations. In fact, we have been working quite   hard to try to build what is a sustainable forest industry.    I hope that helps to answer some of the questions with   regard to that issue, Mr. Chair.   Mr. Adel: Thank you, Mr. Chair. Many communities   do not have the resources to produce detailed community   hazard risk and vulnerability assessments. Why did the   Department of Community Services decide to provide these   assessments to communities only on request, rather than   working with every community to develop emergency   preparedness plans?   Mr. Moore: I appreciate the question and the   opportunity to discuss this issue. Working with the OAG over   the course of something like this, there is a lot of information   that gets passed back and forth. Currently we have — I am   going to mention five different initiatives related to hazard   assessment. What I would like to take the opportunity to do is   clarify the difference between the community hazard mapping   project that you refer to and another one, the LiDAR in   particular, which was around flooding.   The importance of this is that for these hazard   assessments that you were referring to in your question, EMO   Community Services was actually the funding agent for that   project. Funding flowed through our department, but in fact   the lead was actually Yukon College. Yukon College worked   with communities — actually a number of partners — First   Nation partners, municipal partners, the Climate Change   Secretariat and others — to identify which communities that   work was going to be done in. It was a finite project. There   was a funding pot and those projects were identified and done.   They are now — and I’m not sure at what point in time, but   my understanding is that, as soon as those were done, they   were actually put on the Yukon College website and are   currently available on that website. So they were available   through that process.   The focus there was on permafrost, flooding and there   were a number of areas that that focused on. There are four   other projects that I was going to mention. One of them is the   Yukon flood plain risk mapping project. This was a LiDAR-  based project where it mapped out gradients to understand   flooding risks in all communities, and that was done across   the territory — 13 communities across the territory —   flooding being a very significant risk, probably secondary to   wildland fire, but certainly important in many of our   communities.    That one, I believe, there was some communication   around — it’s a very technical report. Water Resources branch   uses it — other experts use it. We haven’t shared that   publicly, although we could. It is more of a — it feeds into   consultants, engineers and others for when we are looking at   developing infrastructure, subdivision development — those   sorts of things. This isn’t available publicly and we think   maybe there was some confusion there, because certainly the   hazard mapping is available publicly and it is right now on the   Yukon government website.   Your point is also well-made — the Auditor General’s   point — that all communities need this support. We couldn’t   agree more. That project was finite — the funding pot — and   those communities were done. We continue to support work   with communities on this. I mentioned the LiDAR project.    We also have done a Yukon hazard and risk vulnerability   assessment, which was funded through the Canadian Safety   and Security program, the Yukon operational flood   forecasting system study and a hazard risk vulnerability   assessment around floods. There are four other studies that   have happened within the last several years to work with   communities, and that’s certainly a priority. We have never   seen the work that was done on this hazard mapping as being   the be-all and end-all. It was a project and it was done and that   funding was spent out, but we look to continue to working   with communities at all times.   I have a list in front of me here. We actually have   emergency plans for all municipalities across the territory. We   have an ongoing project working with First Nations to support     February 14, 2018 STANDING COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC ACCOUNTS 3-23      some of them. There are different statuses; some of them have   pretty up-to-date, workable emergency plans; others we’re   working with actively to develop those.   With those plans, we take an all-hazard approach. We’re   looking at what happens in an emergency in a community,   which are important agencies we need to partner with, and   what kind of lines of communication are available or not   available. When we’re working on a community plan, it’s   more that kind of approach — if there’s an emergency of any   sort, how do we, as a first-response agency, get people the   help they need and bring the resources together to deal with   that emergency, should it happen?   Ms. White: Just for clarification, my understanding   was that, with the hazard mapping that was done through   Yukon College, it was done around municipalities and it was   for them to future plan. It highlighted in the community where   the permafrost zones were, where the low-lying spots were,   and so, to me, not necessarily the same as emergency   preparedness. It was very different.   Just to build on what Mr. Adel said, one of the reasons   why the hazard mapping that was done through the college   was so valuable to those communities is that, when they were   doing their community plans, they were able to look and say   that this land right now may look good, but we know that the   permafrost is only 35 centimetres down and, at the rate we’re   melting, this may not be what you’re looking for. One of the   reasons why that hazard mapping, when we look at the Yukon   College website and we see what it does, and then talk to   municipalities, especially through the AYC, and find out that,   for the municipalities that had access to that — it really helped   them with their community plans.   Now I understand that the funding went through the   college to do that, but would there be an opportunity for the   communities that didn’t have that done to request that kind of   assistance to build those maps for their own future planning   processes?   Mr. Moore: Let me just read — the communities   where these mapping projects happened were Mayo, Dawson   City, Faro, Ross River, Pelly Crossing, Burwash Landing,   Destruction Bay and Old Crow — a bit of a mix of   municipalities and unincorporated communities. It doesn’t   change the question; I think it’s very valid.   We would happily support that kind of initiative, given   funding sources and capacity to do it. Over the course of the   audit and this coming to light, we have done some work on   the decision-making process for these communities to be   chosen over others. We’re not entirely clear; we’re going back   in time a little bit, but one of the biggest parts was active   partners — who was most keen on getting it done?   Should other partnerships come in, we would certainly be   more than happy to work with them to try to identify money,   if the capacity is there. I would want to point out that the   LiDAR, which is particularly important around flooding, and   the work that Mr. Berry talked about earlier around wildland   fire — we’re filling in some of those gaps. The wildland fire   risk assessment methodology is going to help us on a   community-by- community basis, which is more than what   was done on those hazard mapping exercises. The LiDAR   work did identify a lot of the topological hydro features that   fed into that around flooding.   So we have filled in some of the gaps there. That said, we   would be more than happy to work with communities. Some   communities are really keen to do that.   Ms. White: Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thanks for the   answer. Again, it’s just that they were very different. I   understand the difference between mapping out the   floodplains and the fire risks, but I think that Teslin, Watson   Lake and Carcross were the last big three that weren’t   mentioned, especially with Carcross working on developing   their community plan. Watson Lake is continuously trying to   find ways to grow. I’ll just put in a pitch to those guys that   they should contact you.   I do appreciate that they’re different and I do appreciate   now, when we look at the numbers of maps, that they now are   very complex, which is great. It gives more information,   which is helpful on all sides. The ones I was referring to were   definitely used for community planning, so thank you.   Mr. Adel: I would just like to thank everybody for   being here today and answering questions to the best of your   abilities. I know the PAC will be looking for more answers   down the road, as we send you more questions and follow up.   Thank you very much.   Mr. Istchenko: The recommendation in paragraph 55   says: “The Department of Environment; the Department of   Energy, Mines and Resources; and the Department of   Community Services should complete their work to carry out   concrete actions in a timely manner to adapt to the impacts of   climate change. This work could include, but is not limited to,   implementing recommendations from reports, making   information available to decision makers, and explicitly   incorporating climate change into directives, processes, and   policies so that they are integrated into decision making.”   The departments agreed with this recommendation and   said: “The Department of Environment; the Department of   Energy, Mines and Resources; and the Department of   Community Services will carry out concrete actions in a   timely manner. It is envisioned that the new 2019 Yukon   strategy for climate change, energy, and green economy will   include milestones and target completion dates to support   decision making. Where appropriate, recommendations from   reports…” — key words being “from reports” — “… will be   included in directives, processes, and policies.”   I have five questions and, with each question, I would   like each department in turn to answer the question. My first   question is: What progress have you made on work to carry   out concrete actions?   Mr. MacGillivray: This is one of the objectives   through the development of the new strategy, as we have said.   In the interim, we are trying to incorporate this into projects   that we have. Within the Climate Change Secretariat, we’re   primarily the coordinator. We play a secretariat function, but   we do have some INAC monies that are flowing to us now for   adaptation projects, and we are incorporating those principles   into those projects as we deliver on them.     3-24 STANDING COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC ACCOUNTS February 14, 2018      Mr. Mills: In addition, I won’t repeat some of the   things we’re doing with regard to forestry, but I think it is   important to highlight some of the concrete actions that we are   undertaking. As a regulator, we recognize and include climate   change considerations in our project permitting and licensing   processes.    With our local resource industries, we participate in   YESAA assessments and under those assessments, resource   projects are also assessed on how they propose to mitigate and   adapt to climate change. The environmental assessment is   done through YESA. The Yukon environmental and socio-  economic assessment considers how the project emissions   could contribute to climate change and its effects as well, so   we feed into those assessments.   On the mining side, when major mine projects are under   government review, we assess how the project’s infrastructure   could be impacted. We also can propose project adaptations   and mitigations to manage the risk. I spoke earlier about the   fact that we very much play a key role — along with, of   course, our colleagues from the Department of Environment   — when we are doing our submissions to ensure that mine site   infrastructure and the way it is designed does in fact take into   consideration what, at one point, seemed unlikely events but   seem much more common now — the one-in-100, the one-in-  two, the one-in-500 sort of events — based on the risk of — if   you hit those events, what is the potential risk to the   environment or to public health and safety?    Just even on a recent one, just to flag it — the Kudz Ze   Kayah project, or the BMC project. I know that the company   did provide some detail on how they were addressing climate   change, but ultimately the executive committee did request   that they provide more information, partly based on comments   from us as well as from Environment and other parties, related   to the hydrological flow regimes. They are related to a number   of factors, even including changes to the range of the   Finlayson herd due to changes in snow conditions, which are   climate-driven changes.   We are continuing to play an active role in looking at and   ensuring that resource development projects, as they proceed,   are done — that we are considering all of these effects.   We are also working with communities, and there was   just discussion about the hazard mapping projects and the role   of our Yukon Geological Survey, along with Community   Services, academics, Yukon College and local communities.   All recent local area plans that have been developed consider   the impacts of climate change, as I mentioned earlier. Local   area plans include climate change policies that are appropriate   for rural Yukon communities, such as promoting agricultural   development, local food markets and other things with an   attempt to reduce such things — when we think of our local   food strategy — reducing the emissions that go with the   transportation of goods from the south by replacing it with   local and healthy sources.   A few other things — our Agriculture branch, as I   mentioned, does provide climate change modelling in relation   to soil, water and crops, as well as permafrost analysis on land   applications. We also provide agriculture funding to support   environmental stewardship, including the adoption of energy-  efficiency and water-efficiency upgrades with regard to   agriculture. There are other reviews.   Across the board and, of course, with our energy   programs as well — and I touched on some of those earlier —   those are some of what we believe are concrete actions that   started with these policies coming into place. Some of these   programs have been in place for a few years. We continue to   put concrete actions in these.   Mr. Pitfield: Of the 70 commitments, we had 18. I will   go through them at a certain level, and if you want me to drill   down, I would be happy to. The first one is that we were to   complete a Yukon infrastructure risk and vulnerability   assessment. As I mentioned earlier, we will shortly be   completing a permafrost assessment of buildings affected. As   well, we have completed an assessment of 282 of our larger   buildings from a condition point of view that gives us a   planning tool, if you want, for what we do going forward.   Government-funded commercial and institutional   construction and renovation will meet or exceed LEED, which   is an energy-efficiency standard. We are actually now using   the National Building Code, and so we are above LEED and   are doing better than the National Building Code itself by 25   percent.   Incorporate environmental performance considerations in   procurement decisions — so this is the green procurement   policy. We use this actively. We will be looking at it as we   renew the strategy going forward to see what else we can do   and how we can better make it part of day-to-day actions. This   is a behavioural change that we will be trying to effect.   Conduct an energy analysis of all Yukon government   buildings and complete energy savings retrofits — we have   made great progress here. We have a system that we are using   that actually tracks all of the energy from a dollars-and-cents   point of view, and also from an energy-fuels-source point of   view for all of our major buildings. In addition, we have   completed a significant number of energy-efficiency   upgrades, which generate considerable savings and reduce   greenhouse gas emissions, and those will continue as   technology improves.   We are to reduce emissions in the transportation sector by   10 percent. There is more work to be done here. We haven’t   achieved this. We have improved in this. By 2020, we are to   meet 20 percent of government building space heating   requirements with clean energy sources. Again, we are   making progress on this but we haven’t achieved it yet. By   2050, we are to reduce emissions from Yukon government   light fleet operations by five percent. We don’t have the data   for this, but we have continuously been upgrading the fleet of   light vehicles and fuel efficiency is the greatest determinant of   what product we buy. Again, there is more work to do here   but we have made progress.   Consider fuel efficiency in vehicle replacement decisions   — we do that in every case.   Develop a performance audit program for suspected   problem buildings and develop a plan to improve the energy   performance of these buildings. This is ongoing. We do this. I     February 14, 2018 STANDING COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC ACCOUNTS 3-25      can give you several examples of buildings where we have   projects that are planned and will generate significant savings,   if you wish.   In cooperation with the federal Department of Natural   Resources, educate commercial fleet operators and drivers on   driving techniques, et cetera — we have done that and it is   completed.   Improve energy efficiency and reduce the greenhouse gas   emissions of the light vehicle fleet — this was a 2012 priority   action. We continue to work at that.    Develop an information campaign targeting Government   of Yukon staff to increase energy literacy and reduce energy   use in government buildings — this is an ongoing training   requirement. I think there is room here to do more, and we   will be looking to do more.   Use road-construction methods designed to preserve   permafrost on the Yukon highways — we actually have   significant experience managing permafrost in Yukon. It   continues to be a challenge and, as climate change — if I can   say it — gets worse, this is an area where we are spending   more and more of our time. To the extent possible, we are   mitigating impacts of permafrost on both our roadways and   our buildings. It’s very difficult, as you appreciate.   Accelerated replacement of old vehicles with more fuel-  efficient vehicles — we do this on an ongoing basis and   actually, in 2015-16, tripled the budget that went toward this,   which would have made the fleet at that time younger than   otherwise.    Install fleet management information systems in select   heavy- and medium-duty Government of Yukon equipment as   a pilot project — this is happening right now. This system is   being implemented right now right across the fleet at the   heavier-vehicle end. It will generate significant efficiency   savings, including fuel and that kind of thing, but it will also   make the operators safer, so safety is another benefit.   Develop a building construction best practices manual of   Yukon-appropriate energy efficient measures for government   buildings — this is underway and will be completed this   spring. We introduced a secondary sales program in four   government buildings to optimize the use of hydro-generation   during low-use periods. This was completed in the winter of   2017-18. I don’t have any further information on that.   Transfer budgets and billing for utility payments to   departments and agencies as an incentive — this is in   progress. We do have the data; we can make the transfer.   From an administrative point of view, my question as a new   deputy would be: Does this make sense? It relies on the   behaviour of occupants to generate savings, so there is a   significant benefit to doing that.   I’ll stop there, Mr. Chair.   Mr. Moore: I have already mentioned a number of   things that Community Services has been working on, and I   too don’t want to be repetitive, so I’ll go high-level, and if   there’s anything else — any specifics — I’m open to those   questions.   I’ll start with infrastructure development. We talked quite   a bit about our work around managing the federal programs,   but I would like to talk a little bit about how the process works   when we’re developing or project managing specific projects   in communities.   Our team would work very closely with project engineers.   They would use some of the tools we have already talked   about — the hazard assessment maps, the LiDAR reporting —   so it’s very much integrated into our project-by-project   planning. That would include things like — as I mentioned —   flooding, erosion, drainage control and those sorts of things.   We also have to work very closely with local   governments and First Nations. We have done that in large   part through talking about the integrated community   sustainability plans. We do support them in the OCPs and the   developing of OCPs and reviewing of those with an eye to   sustainable development. That has always been a big part of   the lens that we have looked at, and of course, it is becoming   more into focus as we start looking at the impacts of climate   change.   An example I use for how we integrate some of those   changing considerations is in Whistle Bend. The Land   Development branch in Community Services has been   overseeing that project. We have focused on a storm-water   drainage system there and overall flow management, which   probably is beyond what we would have done 10 years ago,   taking into consideration some of the concerns around climate   change.   That has been a very significant change, and it has made   that community much more resilient to extreme weather, such   as flash floods. Another example would be — I mentioned the   new drinking-water treatment facility in Dawson; fire halls —   we have built a number of fire halls in the last few years and   water plants, and they’re all built to post-disaster standards,   making sure that communities have buildings that are able to   withstand earthquakes and other events, to provide safe places   in communities, should a disaster happen.   In Dawson, we are designing the new drinking-water   facility to these standards, and that means laying concrete   foundations that are designed to withstand flooding and taking   considerations with the building layout how sensitive   equipment is placed and those sorts of things.   It is really being operationalized as we start planning any   of these new developments.   With respect to the geotechnical components of that   particular project, all those studies were referenced and we’re   actually backfilling below the foundation with non-frost-  susceptible materials, and we’re including the installation of   backup generators to run the facility in the event of power   outages.   The message I’m trying to deliver is that we really have   operationalized, or normalized, some of this in our planning as   we go forward so we’re ready to respond and manage if   climate change impacts continue to be felt and to be able to   predict them as best as we can at this point in time.   I mentioned already around emergency preparedness that   we have changed the length of our contracts related to fighting   wildland fire. We’re bringing them in earlier, because that has   been our experience over the last number of years, that forest     3-26 STANDING COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC ACCOUNTS February 14, 2018      fire season is happening earlier. We have also brought in some   additional crew resources to be prepared for increased   severity, which some of the modelling is suggesting that will   happen in the Yukon.   Interestingly, some of the modelling is predicting that   we’ll see increased precipitation — so what kind of impact   that would have on our fire season. We’re continuing to study   that, but part of this issue is being able to understand those   variable factors.   In Community Services, we talked a little bit about   landscape management. A colleague at EMR talked about   that. It’s certainly a factor for us. One component of that is the   FireSmart program, which we have continued to run.   FireSmart is very important and we look at that as a model for   where we would like to go, as we consider landscape   management and the importance of landscape management   down the road. It is really the best proactive tool that we have   at our disposal.   So far, we have invested $15 million in over 500   FireSmart projects across the territory. In 2017-18, for   example, 30 projects were funded, totalling $850,000.   The last thing I will mention, although I have kind of   touched on this, is the National Building Code — another very   significant work we do not only around — we talked about the   GHG reduction components of that, but also parts of it have to   do with adaptation — increased snow loads, windage and   those sorts of things are being considered as codes are being   developed down the road.   We’ll leave it at that, if there are any further questions.   Ms. White: Just to follow up, Mr. Pitfield, on   something you said about reducing emissions within the   transportation sector — so you said that you were replacing   vehicles with better gas mileage. At this point in time, how   many electric vehicles or hybrid electric vehicles does   Highways and Public Works have, for example, in the fleet   vehicle section?   Mr. Pitfield: We have one and we’re running a pilot.   The issue in the Yukon with these is batteries, of course.    Ms. White: Absolutely. Historically, of course, we’ve   heard the stories about the batteries, although we have also   heard quite a few success stories. An example would be the   Mount Lorne transfer station. They just put in their first   electric car charging solely from solar. So I appreciate that   there’s a pilot project right now with one electric vehicle, but I   would definitely urge the deputy minister to consider maybe   expanding that as technology — my new hero is Tony Seba.   He is a future planner and he talks about how we’re getting to   the point where the disruption in technology and demand will   change and those advancements will happen.    My hope is, when we talk about reducing our emissions   in the transportation sector, that we recognize that — Tesla,   for example, has just come out with their first electric   transport truck. I have gone from heating by oil to an air-  source heat pump. I think that there are options, and   technology is definitely one of those ones, but there have to be   early adaptors in order to help make that push. My hope is   that, when you look at reducing those emissions in   transportation, you go farther. I will support the minister in   going farther.    I just wanted to know how many electric cars you had.    Mr. Istchenko: Continuing on with the line of   questioning, it was great for the departments and the witnesses   here to highlight some of the actions that you are taking. I   know there are a lot of actions that have been going on, and   they are important actions.    One thing I would like to ask department now is: Now   that you have undergone a lot of these different actions —   some of them are complete, and some of them are a work in   progress — and you measure the effectiveness of these actions   with regard to climate change, how will you measure them   and how will you report on those?    Mr. MacGillivray: As a secretariat, as I said   previously, we are responsible really for coordinating,   collaborating and providing that secretariat function. One of   the things that we have done and we will continue to do is to   help government set a standard and to try to ensure that we   have folks following that standard. As we’ve said before, this   will happen over the next 18 months with the development of   this strategy.    We’re also feeding into, though, the national — so   through us, we feed the Yukon government data up into the   national processes as well. That’s primarily our job.    Mr. Mills: We continue to report on certain program   areas within our departments, such as our Energy branch, on   annual reporting that gets tabled in the Assembly and we are   able to look at the costs, the expenditures, how many people   participated in these programs, the reduction in greenhouse   gas emissions as a result of that.    I think that, as we move forward and we develop the   strategy, the missing link is setting the target, of which we are   trying to determine the efficient use of those resources — and   is it getting us toward a target that is being set by the   government. This is part of our process of rolling this up. I   know the Auditor General’s recommendations are absolute,   but these strategies do need to have these sorts of goals that   we need to establish and then measure our success against.   We’ll continue to report on that over this interim period. We’ll   continue to do the work that we’re doing with our Forestry   branch and other ones in health of the forest or delivering out   of these programs. But again, we do need to work with our   partners and come up with real milestones, goals and timelines   and look at the effective use of resources.   The other thing I would note is the challenge — and when   you look at all the recommendations that came out and we   look at our report card about what we completed and what’s   ongoing — we need to improve the nature of the   recommendations because some of them, for example, say to   continue to implement energy efficiency programs. There is   no end date. There is no real goal that you’re looking at. It’s   ongoing, so you can say we didn’t complete it but there is no   completion on it. When I look through a lot of the things   where it simply shows it as ongoing or incomplete, it’s   because these programs don’t really — the objective in here   doesn’t actually set out a goal of what we’re trying to achieve     February 14, 2018 STANDING COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC ACCOUNTS 3-27      through the delivery of these programs — continue to educate.   Things like that aren’t necessarily action-oriented or don’t set   what we want to strive for.    Mr. Pitfield: We already have rich data on the building   side and we’ll continue to be able to report against that. On   the transportation side, as you’ve heard, we are getting better   and better at what we’re doing and, as technology improves,   our data will improve as well.   The other area of influence that we can contribute efforts   to is in procurement, so here we can influence government   behaviour. We can influence what is actually purchased so, if   we wanted green cars, that is a way of influencing that. We   can also influence the behaviour of the private sector through   our requirements. This is more amorphous to measure. It is   more difficult, but I think that as we’re able to, under the next   strategy, be more sophisticated with what we’re doing here,   we’ll be able to provide better data as well. That’s all I have to   say.   Mr. Moore: There’s a bit of a theme here. I was going   to say that Community Services is a very operational   department. We help people build stuff through the National   Building Code and we coordinate and plan emergency   responses. It’s hard to put tangible measures on some of that,   although we do agree and we’re going to work hard as we   move into the 2018 strategy to develop targets that are   measureable, because it is useful. We’re working on —   frankly across the board — improving how we evaluate our   programs and services. I think it is a very important for   government to do across the board, not just on climate change.   We do want to find some targets, and that will see that   conversation happening as we work through the strategy.   There are some specifics that we can talk about. I did   mention that we’ll have very defined reporting mechanisms as   we spend the money in the ICIP program. Canada will — we   haven’t seen it yet, but we understand there will be templates   and measurements, so that part of our programming will have   targets and we’re working with Canada on that.   The second one that I would mention is that we have a lot   of data around wildland fire, and we are working with our   counterparts across the country at CIFFC. They are actually   working on developing some benchmarks, data and reporting   that will help track and measure things. We have a lot of   information under wildland fire, but it is really important to   share that and learn across the country as we learn and make   that program more effective. We’re working with them to   develop those targets.   Mr. Istchenko: I thank the witnesses for those answers.   I understand that, with the concrete actions and with   measuring the effectiveness, baseline data is key to that. My   next question is: What baseline information is in place, and is   there further baseline work that is needed?   Mr. MacGillivray: I think we mentioned previously   the National Inventory Report — it was noted in the audit. We   believe the inventory report that Canada produces is   underreporting greenhouse gas emissions here in the Yukon.   There has been a lot of effort that has gone into that, to be   honest with you, over the past several years, and we have just   recently had a revision to that, which Canada is out consulting   on currently. That is part of what the baseline is requiring —   just good reporting. We’re trying to make sure that   jurisdictions are reporting in a like manner as well, so this can   be rolled up into meeting our national commitments. That is   another area that we’re focusing on.   As I have said, we have actually taken a step in the past   of going one step further with the carbon registry that we had   participated in. Again, this allows us to get an independent   audit of the actual numbers that we’re reporting on, on an   annual basis. We’re one of the only jurisdictions in Canada   that actually uses a registry in that manner and that actually   uses it to report as well. That is some of the work that has   been done.   There is a whole lot of work that now that is happening,   like I said, around best practices across the country. We’ll be   talking a lot about what data we have in the territory, what we   can report on and where we need to be putting additional   resources to get new data.   Mr. Mills: In the information we have, there is the   energy state-of-play report that was developed and is part of   some of the baseline information as we move forward with   our partners in relation to developing this policy, so that has   been referenced earlier. There is one state-of-play report in   relation to climate change. We have one in relation to energy   as well. We definitely have information related to energy use   — some of the effectiveness of the programs, where we’re at   through our annual reporting that we do through our Energy   branch.   With regard to land and geology, for example, we have   fairly extensive information related to geology in the Yukon.   We continue, through these hazard mapping projects, to   develop additional information related to communities, but   there is still more — it was pointed out by one of the members   of the Committee that there are communities that also need   additional work done.   With regard to our future and if geothermal fits within the   future, we do have a well and a monitoring program in the Hot   Springs Road area that is starting to collect some key   information that helps to provide some more verification to   some of the CanGEA and our Geological Surveys mapping   work that was done throughout the Yukon to identify   geothermal potential.   That’s important baseline data for us as to whether or not   there are opportunities around geothermal for either displacing   on heating or even potential power generation. We’re looking   at another project with our partners in Ross River over the   next month to do some additional monitoring work with   regard to that potential in the Ross River area.   There is this information that is there, but definitely more   information will have to be collected. I would assume, as you   enter into this process with the partners and you talk to   different players and stakeholders, that we’ll probably identify   other information gaps that are necessary to develop baseline   data so that we can have something to measure against. I think   that would come out through this exercise as we develop the   strategy, and whether that input comes from government or     3-28 STANDING COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC ACCOUNTS February 14, 2018      First Nations or the other partners, or with industry — there   are a lot of holders of this information.   I thought I would share that, Mr. Chair.   Mr. Pitfield: Our baseline data comes in three forms.   On fleet vehicles and heavy equipment, we have emissions   data as well as fuel usage that we can contribute. Energy use   in buildings — I have talked about this before. We have a   massive database of this information, and it has all the   information for major buildings in the Yukon government   going back to 2010. I don’t know of another jurisdiction that   can talk about their portfolio that way.   We also have data in terms of building conditions that   indirectly leads to energy usage and greenhouse gas   emissions.    We may be able to contribute more on the adaptation side   of these issues. I mentioned earlier culvert sizing. That   happens more and more as watersheds change and flows   increase. We also have much to contribute in terms of   permafrost, and that’s an evolving story. Going forward, we’ll   be able to contribute more.   Two of these areas — vehicles and energies in buildings   — those are two of the biggest contributors to the whole issue   of climate change. By having good data, we will enable the   strategy to come out.   Mr. Moore: We definitely have availed ourselves of   much of the data that’s out there already. We have already   heard some of it around the flooding history — and that’s held   by Water Resources — and precipitation measurements and   permafrost that my colleague at HPW has worked on. We   avail ourselves of that and that data is very important to us.   I mentioned some of the work that we’re doing with our   colleagues in wildland fire through CIFFC, so I won’t go into   that anymore. One of the things that I think is really important   and that I haven’t mentioned yet is around asset management.   Community Services is leading an initiative to develop asset   management capacity across the territory, so we have worked   with municipalities and First Nations. They have all received   funding within the last year to develop an asset management   database and an understanding of how data asset management   can really help them in their communities. That was up to   $40,000 that came through to the Yukon government as part   of the northern strategy funding envelope.   We developed a community of practice and, even just last   week, we had a workshop where we had First Nation and   municipality infrastructure or capital-type managers learning   about the importance of asset management. I mention that   because it ties into the question directly. I talked about the   Dawson in-ground water and sewer installations that are   happening. That has only been 15 years since those were   installed in Dawson on Fifth Avenue.   In Haines Junction last year, there were 14 or 15 breaks in   the in-ground services. I do think we need to particularly   understand our in-ground services better, and that’s what that   asset management project is going to give us. It’s going to   give us a better understanding and help us as we plan forward.   As a gap, it’s there, and I think we have an approach through   that asset management process to help us better understand   and plan for replacement over time.   Mr. Adel: I just have a quick question for HPW. The   last time we were here at a public meeting, before you were   here, Mr. Pitfield, they were talking about data verification on   the assessment they did with the buildings and that it had sat   dormant for so long on understanding what the building   energy and all the other things were doing because the   information wasn’t verified. Has that been done since?   Mr. Pitfield: I’m told that is complete and we’re using   it for budgeting purposes.   Mr. Istchenko: I thank the witnesses. I know the line   of questioning this morning — that a lot of that stuff you’re   repeating now and have gone through on some of the actions.   We have heard a lot of them, and I thank you for that. I asked   earlier about measuring the effectiveness of these actions in   regard to climate change, and then, of course, baseline data   stuff. What I am wondering now is: With all this work and all   this planning, how is that going to be used to inform decision-  making and then policy-making as you move forward?   Mr. MacGillivray: I guess that really is the challenge   for us going forward — collecting information that will help   us inform decision-making and policy-making. This is part of   what we’re going to try to build into the climate change   strategy that we’re working on with energy and green   economy as well. That really is what this is about — bringing   our partners together and working to ensure that the strategy   gives us tangible ways to actually implement and incorporate   this into the work that we do going forward.   The secretariat is involved in that realm, and it is work   underway at this point in time.   Mr. Mills: I thank you for the question. I’m just trying   to think of — to me, we are continuing to deliver what we   think are good programs. We will continue to do the inventory   work with regard to forestry. We will continue to deliver the   programs related to — whether they’re residential,   commercial, retrofit programs — things like this.   To me, it’s a point of continuing to deliver what we   believe is working well, but also looking forward to   development of a strategy that allows us to determine whether   or not there are elements of our programming that it’s time to   shut down, whether there are some areas that we need to put   additional resources toward — but with us working with the   other departments toward specific goals that are Yukon-wide.    So I’m not sure if I’m answering the question, but I just   feel like this isn’t — it’s not that we’re saying the strategy is   just sort of out there to reach — kind of working toward — or   that it’s a buzzword or anything. This is essential for us to   ensure that we are allocating the necessary and appropriate   resources to things that we need to do in Yukon with regard to   whether it is adaption or real efforts in reducing our   greenhouse gas emissions. So we’re in a bit of a transition   period here. We still have some ongoing program. We also   have some commitments that we continue to address. We look   forward to coming up with what I think will be a new strategy   and a new vision that will assist in making good decisions at a   department level, but also at a Yukon-wide level.      February 14, 2018 STANDING COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC ACCOUNTS 3-29      Mr. Pitfield: We definitely will use this now and we do   use it now. We’ll use it going forward in terms of our capital   planning. It’s a consideration in terms of our functional   planning. We definitely use it for any building project — or   building-related — and less so in terms of roads in highways.   It is a consideration in our procurement policy development.    I guess, stepping back from this, it’s a consideration in all   of our business decisions. However, there are other significant   drivers that go along with that — the needs of citizens, the   costs, the budgets that we’re looking at, the priority of projects   and conditions of assets and all this kind of thing. So this is   one significant driver and there is a handful of significant   ones.    Mr. Moore: The first thing that came to mind with the   question was around the infrastructure program — what types   of infrastructure projects are selected and prioritized? In part,   that would be to meet the reporting on that 10-megatonne   reduction of GHGs, but equally important is focusing on how   we build resilient communities across the territory. How do   we make sure that when emergencies happen, the   infrastructure resources are there to help communities deal   with that?    With respect to wildland fire, it already very much   informs what we do on a year-to-year basis. I’ve already   alluded to much of that — when we tender contracts, what   kind of contracts we’re tendering, how we choose to export   crews or not, depending on what and where fires are, what   part of the season it is — landscape fire management   decisions — where are our big fuel loads? Those sorts of   questions — to all be informed as we start developing that   landscape management capacity.    With respect to the National Building Code — as we   continue to adopt the best practices that are encapsulated in   that code — so how buildings are constructed across the   territory, or be informed as we learn more and that data   becomes more available. It certainly informs the emergency   planning we do. I mean, we have always and we will continue   to do emergency planning — that all-hazard approach — but   certainly, it will be effected by our growing understanding of   emergencies — where, when — those sorts of things.    Mr. Istchenko: Just one final quick question — I do   want to thank you for the answers. I think we have just about   most of what I needed to hear today and what the committee   needed here today. So my final question for you would be:   Are the four departments confident that what they’ve said in   the House here today — that within six months from this date   — because we know that we can’t just wait for the 2019   strategy — and just a yes or no answer: Are you confident that   you will be where you want to be?   Chair: He said it’s simple — yes or no.    Mr. MacGillivray: I think that we’re going to be on a   path. I don’t think we will have reached the destination.    Mr. Mills: Yes, Mr. Chair.    Mr. Pitfield: Yes.    Hon. Ms. McPhee: Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank   you to the Committee for the opportunity to be here, and thank   you to all of the witnesses and to the Auditor General and the   officers who are here today.    Some of the questions and responses have already   touched on some of my questions today, but my questions are   quite specific about greenhouse gas emissions and the targets.   So I think we’ll just go back there for just a few minutes.    In the report, in paragraph 56, it says: “The reduction of   greenhouse gas emissions requires estimation of emission   levels, tracking of these levels over time, forecasting of future   levels, and setting and achieving targets.”   It goes on to say in paragraph 57: “The National   Inventory Report, produced by Environment and Climate   Change Canada, contains Canada’s annual estimates of   greenhouse gas emissions dating back to 1990. Officials at the   Climate Change Secretariat told us that the Government of   Yukon determined, on the basis of analysis, that the National   Inventory Report underestimated Yukon’s emission levels.”   We have heard a little bit about that today. “Consequently, the   Government of Yukon calculated its own estimates of   greenhouse gas emissions, primarily from fuel consumption   for transportation, heating, and electricity generation between   2009 and 2015. These estimates differed from those in the   National Inventory Report.”   My first question with respect to that is for the Climate   Change Secretariat, and maybe the next couple are as well.   How do we arrive at the correct information about greenhouse   gas emissions? Said another way, how should we resolve this   conflict between what the Yukon is clearly estimating as   possible greenhouse gas emissions and targets and what the   national body has said?   Mr. MacGillivray: That’s a good question. I think we   have been working collaboratively with Environment Canada   and with Statistics Canada, and we have now brought our   Bureau of Statistics in as well. We have managed to show the   federal government that there are fuels coming into the   territory that they are missing. They have acknowledged that,   and now it’s just a matter of how we get to the solution.    As I said, about two weeks ago, Environment Canada   came out with some new emissions data. It has really   narrowed the gap. What it has done is that it has almost   removed the gap — five years back. So they have been   working retrospectively. The gap is very small for 2010, 2011   and 2012, but for 2013 and 2014 — or I may be wrong — it is   2014 and 2015 — the gap gets larger again. To be honest, we   have just received these, we are analyzing, and we are trying   to figure this out. We have a willing partner in the federal   government to try to correct his, and I think we are on the   right path.   Hon. Ms. McPhee: Again, my questions are quite   specific — but is the Yukon now measuring greenhouse gas   emissions consistent with the methodology that is used in the   National Inventory Report. I appreciate that you have said that   targets are getting a little closer by virtue of analysis that has   been affected by the Yukon’s contribution, but are we using   the same tools?   Mr. MacGillivray: The short answer is no, but I think I   am going to ask Ms. Burrows to respond a little bit more.     3-30 STANDING COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC ACCOUNTS February 14, 2018      Ms. Burrows: We undertook a study in 2015 that was   meant to look just at transportation, so we had a contractor   undertake that work. They ended up undertaking an economy-  wide look at fuel use and then looking at greenhouse gas   emissions across the territory. That is where we understood   where the National Inventory Report was different from the   data that was available in the territory. That is how we   understood that the National Inventory Report was   underreporting for us. So no, we are not using the same   methodology because we are using fuel tax data from the   Department of Finance and with support from the Yukon   Bureau of Statistics and converting that fuel use data using   conversions to greenhouse gas emissions.   What I can say is that, as was mentioned, we just got   updated data from the National Inventory Report about two   weeks ago, and they have managed to make improvements, so   it’s not as big a discrepancy as it has been, because they are   starting to use the fuel tax data that we have been using for   our calculations. We are not using the exact same   methodology, but we are definitely on the right path for what   we are doing to calculate our emissions and it is actually being   used by the federal government now.   Hon. Ms. McPhee: Thank you for that. It helps to   explain some of where we are going. I do think we need to be   using the same measuring sticks — or at least something that   is convertible so that we are able to understand it.   In paragraph 59 of the report, it says: “Setting and   achieving targets is essential to the reduction of greenhouse   gas emission levels. We found that the Government of Yukon   forecasted greenhouse gas emissions for 2010 to 2027.   However, because it could not accurately predict population,   level of industrial activity, and economic growth, the   Government of Yukon determined that it could not set a   territory-wide target to reduce greenhouse gas emission   levels.”   My question as a result of that is — presumably these   factors are somewhat unpredictable in other jurisdictions as   well, so what is the government doing with respect to that   comment by the Auditor General? How will Yukon reduce its   greenhouse gas emissions if the government believes that it   can’t set territory-wide targets, or even targets that are not   necessarily territory-wide for greenhouse gas emissions? How   are we going to tackle that problem?   Mr. MacGillivray: This has been a conundrum that has   been around for a long time with a small jurisdiction and   small population, developing economy and heavy reliance,   really, on the mining sector. When we get a new mine that   opens, it changes our emissions profiles enormously, it has   impacts on the population, and it has impacts across the board.   This is one that we struggle with. In part, that’s why we ended   up with sector-specific targets under the previous strategies. It   at least allowed us to isolate the mining sector and we could   be making progress in other areas, and then when a new mine   came on and our numbers went through the roof, and then a   mine shut down and our numbers went through the floor —   things that were really out of our control to a large degree   could be more isolated.    As far as the answer going forward, that’s something that   we and our partners will be working on through the   development of the strategy. It is a tough question — knowing   where the territory is going to be in 10 years’ time.   Hon. Ms. McPhee: I have one more quote for you. I   think it sets the tone of the question. I will make reference to   paragraph 61: “We found that according to information   provided by the Climate Change Secretariat, of the 12 targets   to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,   “2 of the 4 targets had been met ahead of their 2020   completion dates;   “4 targets had not been met, and of these, 1 was not   measurable; and   “4 targets could not be measured because data was not yet   available.     “For 1 of the 4 targets that could not be measured   because of unavailable data, the 2010 baseline information   was still not available. In our opinion, this situation was not   acceptable.”    I have a couple of questions about that. There continued   to be targets for which there is no data available?   Mr. MacGillivray: We have the 12 targets that were   identified through the course of the three different strategy-  setting or progress reports. Whether or not there is data — we   have had data issues. What happened was that we set 2010 as   the baseline. Our data collection improved and we had a hard   time rebasing back to 2010, and so I think the short answer is   that there are probably targets that we have a hard time   coming up with an apples-to-apples comparison. Those were   Yukon government-specific targets that we’re talking about.   Hon. Ms. McPhee: My follow-up question from that   then would be: If there is still 2010 baseline information that   is not available, for let’s say one of the targets or any of the   targets, why is that the case? Is there not some way to resolve   that?   Mr. MacGillivray: What has happened is, because of   the data improvements that have been made over the course of   time, it is now a matter of, is it worth the time and resources to   go back and to recalculate 2010? It actually means some new   data-gathering. Given the limited resources that we have, is   that really where we want to be spending our time — going   back and collecting new information for 2010 so that we can   actually make it comparable to today?   Hon. Ms. McPhee: I didn’t hear the last part.   Chair: Sorry, Mr. MacGillivray, we missed the last   part.   Mr. MacGillivray: Sorry; my apologies. It really does   come down to setting priorities with limited resources.   Hon. Ms. McPhee: My last question would be then:   What is the target for which this baseline data was not   available? The information seems to be that there was one for   which that was not available. What are we talking about   there? What is the target?   Mr. MacGillivray: I am looking at my notes right now.   Perhaps the auditors can help us with that one.   Ms. Thomas: Right now, I don’t have that information   with me, but definitely we can get back with that.     February 14, 2018 STANDING COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC ACCOUNTS 3-31      Mr. MacGillivray: We did have a hard time   reconciling some of the targets with the final numbers at the   end of the day in the report and so, yes, that would be helpful.   Chair: Before I adjourn this hearing, I would like to   make a few remarks on behalf of the Standing Committee on   Public Accounts. First of all, I would like to thank all of the   witnesses who appeared before the Public Accounts   Committee today. I would also like to thank the officials from   the Office of the Auditor General of Canada and, of course,   Sarah Edwards, our Acting Clerk of the Public Accounts   Committee, for all of their help here.   The purpose of the Public Accounts Committee is to   ensure accountability for the use of public funds. Public   hearings are an important part of this work. The Committee’s   report on this hearing will be tabled in the Legislative   Assembly and we invite those who appeared before the   Committee, and other Yukoners as well, to read the report and   to communicate to the Committee their reaction to it.   I would also like to add that today’s hearing does not   necessarily signal the end of the Committee’s consideration of   the issues raised in the Auditor General’s report. The   Committee may follow up with a department or with all   departments on the implementation of the commitments made   and respond to the recommendations of the Auditor General   and of the Committee itself. This could, of course, include a   follow-up public hearing at some point in the future.   If I could, I would just like to take the opportunity to   reiterate with the deputies here today, and for the record in   general, that a vital component to these hearings and the   process that we undertake as a Committee to address reports   from the Auditor General is the completion of the   commitments that departments themselves make. The   completion of commitments is a priority for this Public   Accounts Committee and we will continue to follow up with   departments to track progress. Our efforts to follow up will be   evident to some of our departments already, as we have begun   to reach out and follow up on two previous hearings that took   place. Those, of course, were the capital asset management   and the government transfer to societies.   With that, again, I would like to just thank everyone for   their participation today and all of the help leading up to today   and I declare this hearing adjourned.      The Committee adjourned at 3:06 p.m.      OAG Climate Change Performance Audit- Yukon Government Action Plan     Recommendation YG Response Lead  Actions Timing Status Progress and Success Measures   30. The Climate Change  Secretariat, working with  departments and other  stakeholders, should  prepare a comprehensive  territory-wide risk  assessment to help prioritize  commitments to manage the  impacts of climate change.   Agreed.     The Government of Yukon is already  planning a climate risk-management  approach for its own operations. In  2016, the Department of Environment  was directed to work with government  departments to integrate risk  assessments and mitigation actions  related to climate change in  government policies, procedures, and  projects. A climate risk assessment  contract is underway, and this  information will support high-risk  departments to develop “climate risk  reduction plans,” including an  implementation and monitoring plan. It  is anticipated that this work will be  completed in 2019. Portions of this work  will inform government commitments in  a new climate change, energy, and  green economy strategy planned to be  released in 2019.      The Government of Yukon will work to  complete a Yukon-wide climate risk  assessment to help Yukoners prioritize  actions that will address the most  significant current and expected  impacts of climate change. The climate  risk assessment would explore specific  areas of vulnerability to climate hazards  and recommend priority areas for risk  reduction.

This work will be  completed by Summer 2018.       Recommendation YG Response Lead  Actions Timing Status Progress and Success Measures   31. The Department of  Environment; the  Department of Energy,  Mines and Resources; the  Department of Highways  and Public Works; and the  Department of Community  Services should develop  climate change  commitments that are time- bound and costed.  Commitments to reduce  greenhouse gas emissions  should indicate the intended  levels of reductions.   Agreed.     It is anticipated that commitments and  targets in the new 2019 Yukon strategy  for climate change, energy, and green  economy will be supported by clear  milestones, completion dates, and  associated costs. More rigorous  monitoring and reporting for Yukon  actions would work to support the  actions and outcomes in the Pan- Canadian Framework on Clean Growth  and Climate Change.      The Government of Yukon will work to  include levels of greenhouse gas  emission reductions anticipated to be  achieved in future commitments.      All departments • Develop commitments  and targets in new  strategy which are  measurable and  supported by clear  milestones,  completion dates, and  associated costs in  the new 2019 Yukon  strategy for climate  change, energy, and  green economy.      • Include anticipated  greenhouse gas  emissions reductions  to be achieved in  future commitments.         Ongoing On Track Work is underway to develop a new  strategy to address climate change,  energy, and green economic growth in  Yukon, in partnership with Yukon and  transboundary First Nations, the  Inuvialuit, and Yukon municipalities.  The development of commitments and  targets is currently planned for late  2018.    Work is already underway to help  improve the accuracy and availability of  baseline information for improved  reporting including:    • Robust greenhouse gas emissions   estimate with the Yukon Bureau of  Statistics.   • Two ‘State of Play’ reports related  to energy and adaptation in the  territory.   • Work with the Canadian Council of  Ministers of the Environment to  develop recommendations for  common metrics and indicators to  be used in monitoring the outcomes  of the actions laid out in the Pan- Canadian Framework on Clean  Growth and Climate Change.     44. The Climate Change  Secretariat should publicly  report in a consistent  manner on progress made  on all commitments, and on  the expenditures associated  with meeting the  commitments.   Agreed.

The Department of  Environment, the  Department of Energy,  Mines and Resources, and  the Department of  Community Services should  complete their work to carry  out concrete actions in a  timely manner to adapt to  the impacts of climate  change. This work could  include, but is not limited to,  implementing  recommendations from  reports, making information  available to decision  makers, and explicitly  incorporating climate change  into directives, processes,  and policies so that they are  integrated into decision- making.     Agreed.       The Department of Environment, the  Department of Energy, Mines and  Resources, and the Department of  Community Services will carry out  concrete actions in a timely manner. It  is envisioned that the new 2019 Yukon  strategy for climate change, energy,  and green economy will include  milestones and target completion dates  to support decision making. Where  appropriate, recommendations from  reports will be included in directives,  processes, and policies.     All departments  • Include milestones  and target completion  dates to support  decision making as  part of new Yukon  strategy for climate  change, energy, and  green economy.     • Where appropriate,   recommendations  from reports will be  included in directives,  processes, and  policies.   Ongoing On Track It is intended that clear milestones and  target completion dates will be  established as part of the strategy  development in 2018.     The more holistic approach to working  with Yukon First Nations and  communities (all Yukon and  transboundary First Nations, all Yukon  municipalities, the Inuvialuit, the  Council of Yukon First Nations, and the  Association of Yukon communities were  invited to partner in developing the  strategy) will support the  implementation of concrete adaptation  action across the territory.               Yukon February 18, 2019  Stacey Hassard, Chair Standing Committee on Public Accounts  Dear Mr. Hassard:  Re: Status update to the Standing Committee on Public Accounts — February 6, 2019  Please find below a status update requested by the committee to inform the report being prepared following the public hearing on the Report of the Auditor General of Canada to the Yukon Legislative Assembly — 2017: Climate Change in Yukon, which was held on February 14, 2018.  1. Differentiating between targets and commitments  Included in the suite of actions to help achieve the objectives in the new climate change, energy and green economy strategy will be targets and commitments. While these actions (which may be referred to as commitments) are still under development, it is still anticipated that they will be defined through setting clear milestones and completion dates, and accompanied by anticipated levels of greenhouse gas emissions (CHO) reductions, where appropriate.  In addition, targets will be established as a tool to complement the work used to track emissions and report on performance.  2. Timelines for departmental commitments  As one of the partners in the development of the new climate change, energy and green economy strategy, Yukon government is working across its departments to identify departmental commitments. Timelines for these commitments will follow the development of the strategy. A draft of the new climate change, energy and green economy strategy is anticipated for public reviewed in late 2019.  3. The framework for the new strategy on climate change  The objectives of the new strategy include supporting clean, secure and sustainable energy, reducing GHG emissions, ensuring Yukon is resilient to the impacts of climate change, and fostering new economic opportunities.

While actions are still under development, it is still anticipated that they will be supported by clear milestones and completion dates, anticipated levels of greenhouse gas emissions reductions, and reporting systems to enable clear accounting of progress.  Progress to-date on the development of the new strategy:  In 2017, a total of 31 governments and organizations such as Yukon First Nation, transboundary and municipal governments, as well as the Association of Yukon Communities and the Council of Yukon First Nations, were invited to participate in the development of the strategy. Two face-to-face meetings were held with the partner group, first in February 2018 to launch the project and again in April 2018 to discuss and plan the public engagement.  • In fall 2018, 20 public engagement events on climate change, energy and green economy were held in 12 Yukon communities and Inuvik to gather initial input into priorities and actions important to Yukoners. Approximately 300 people participated in the meetings and 28 of the 31 municipal and Indigenous governments that were invited to partner in the strategy initiative participated in the planning and/or delivery of these events. We received 481 responses to our online survey and the project team met with 22 stakeholder groups including industry associations, businesses, energy organizations, environmental non-government organizations, and others. We anticipate releasing a ‘What We Heard’ document in late Spring.  • We met again with the partner group on February 12 and 13, 2019 to discuss the initial input into the strategy, identify gaps, and to collaboratively identify a process for defining priorities and drafting the strategy.  4. Which department is taking the lead  The Government of Yukon is working collaboratively with Yukon First Nations, transboundary Indigenous groups, and Yukon municipalities to develop a new climate change, energy and green economy strategy. On the Yukon government side, this initiative is being co-lead by the departments of Environment, Energy Mines and Resources, and Economic Development.  Sincerely,  ‘ A  %1n L.

Differentiating between targets and commitments  Included in the suite of actions to help achieve the objectives in the new climate change, energy and green economy strategy will be targets and commitments. While these actions (which may be referred to as commitments) are still under development, it is still anticipated that they will be defined through setting clear milestones and completion dates, and accompanied by anticipated levels of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) reductions, where appropriate.  In addition, targets will be established as a tool to complement the work used to track emissions and report on performance.  2. Timelines for departmental commitments  As one of the partners in the development of the new climate change, energy and green economy strategy, Yukon government is working across its departments to identify departmental commitments. Timelines for these commitments will follow the development of the strategy. A draft of the new climate change, energy and green economy strategy is anticipated for public reviewed in late 2019.  3. The framework for the new strategy on climate change  The objectives of the new strategy include supporting clean, secure and sustainable energy, reducing GHG emissions, ensuring Yukon is resilient to the impacts of climate change, and fostering new economic opportunities.

The Department of Energy, Mines and Resources has also undertaken a number of initiatives to reduce GHG emissions and promote climate change adaptation.  • Our Independent Power Production Policy is fully implemented. This allows First Nation governments, communities and entrepreneurs to generate renewable energy and feed new electricity into the electrical grid, to help meet local demands and reduce GHG emissions.    Stacy Hassard Page 3 February 20, 2019  • The Independent Power Production Policy, as well as the Micro-generation Policy, encourages new energy generation to increase Yukon’s electricity supply, and assists utilities in meeting the demand for affordable, reliable, flexible and clean electrical energy.  • Our energy efficiency initiatives are making a significant impact, We have collectively saved enough energy to power over 2,400 non-electrically-heated Yukon homes for one year and prevented over 40,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions.  • Our energy efficiency initiatives assist Yukoners to collectively meet our climate change commitments, lessen our energy consumption, reduce Yukon’s carbon footprint and increase renewable energy solutions. Ultimately, these efforts help sustain and protect Yukon’s environment.  • The Forest Management Branch accessed funding through the Climate Change Preparedness in the North Program for establishing long-term monitoring plots in Dawson region. This was in partnership with Tr’ondék Hwech’in and Canadian Forest Service. This work contributes to existing plots in southern Yukon. This information is used for vegetation inventory, tree growth, forest health, ecosystem dynamics and possible species migration research. This information will provide forest managers and researchers with data to model and predict forest changes that will guide adaptive measures,  • The Silviculture Strategic Plan was approved in May 2018. The plan sets out priorities for Forest Management Branch to ensure commercially harvested forests are regenerated successfully. The strategic plan sets out goals to develop industry capacity and ensure that the Elijah Smith Forest Renewal Fund is used transparently and effectively. Climate and changing climatic conditions are considered during reforestation activities to help ensure forest regeneration success.  4.

Timelines for departmental commitments  As one of the partners in the development of the new climate change, energy and green  economy strategy, Yukon government is working across its departments to identify  departmental commitments. limelines for these commitments will follow the development  of the strategy. A draft of the new climate change, energy and green economy strategy is  anticipated for public review in late 2019.  Highways and Public Works is developing actions to support the goals of the new climate  change, energy and green economy strategy that will include:  • Reducing the energy footprint of Yukon government buildings through building  standards for new construction, efficiency upgrades of existing buildings, more efficient use of space and increasing our use of biomass and other renewable or lower  greenhouse gas energy sources.  • Addressing the impacts of climate change by continuing to assess and monitor  existing buildings located on permafrost, ensuring new buildings meet standards for climate change resiliency, and continuing to monitor and assess the impacts of climate change on our transportation network.  • Reducing the impact of Yukon government transportation by modernizing our vehicle fleet improving fuel efficient driving practices, reducing idling and encouraging employees to find alternatives to driving.  Highways and Public Works is already making progress on a number of these actions, for example:  • We have completed energy assessments on 26 buildings in preparation for more than $45M of investment in retrofits, heating upgrades, renewable energy and energy conservation. This is in addition to many projects already completed. Significant upgrades to one building led to a 1% reduction in the Yukon government’s overall energy consumption.  • We have incorporated energy reduction targets in new buildings. For example, our new 150 bed continuing care facility exceeded the stringent National Energy Code for Buildings by 25% and an upcoming new school will have the same target  ./3    • We have developed a building standards manual that provides guidelines for all  aspects of construction including energy performance, reduced greenhouse gas  emissions and considerations for building in permafrost zones.  3.
