underway to curb  greenhouse gas emissions, but unless concerted  action happens soon, further and more extreme  changes may become unavoidable. Scientists  project that Vancouver will experience increased  annual precipitation and temperatures, with  hotter, drier summers. More intense and frequent  rain and wind storms are anticipated, and sea  level rise will pose a significant challenge by  mid-century. Adaptation refers to actions taken  to respond to the impacts of climate change by  taking advantage of opportunities, or reducing  the associated risks.  there is significant overlap between climate  change adaptation, mitigation and sustainability  measures including those designed to improve  greenspace, foster urban agriculture and facilitate   improvements in buildings and urban infrastructure.   Adaptation more explicitly engages a wider range   of issues, particularly emergency management,  health and the needs of vulnerable populations in  a changing climate. Many existing City actions are   already forwarding adaptation, and the focus of the  Climate Change Adaptation Strategy is to build on   these actions and propose new ‘no regret’ actions –  those that benefit the community regardless of the  extent of climate change we eventually experience.  Strategy development began last spring and loosely   followed the iCLei “Changing Climate, Changing   Communities” guide. the first step included working  with the pacific Climate impacts Consortium at  UVic to acquire a detailed understanding of   anticipated changes to the regional climate. Using  these climate projections, impacts to the City were   identified through interviews with general managers   and working group meetings. impacts were prior- itized through a risk and vulnerability assessment,  and adaptation actions were devised and evaluated   through staff workshops. the Adaptation Steering   Committee provided final review and comment  on the Strategy. implementation of the Strategy  will be the responsibility of department staff with  coordination and support from the Sustainability  group.   the Strategy includes primary and supporting   actions which are all detailed in a matrix in   Appendix A, including accountability and priority.  proposed actions were evaluated based on their  effectiveness; overlap with sustainability and   mitigation goals; cost-benefit ratio; and time horizon  for anticipated impacts. they are prioritized into the  categories of ‘must do’, ‘monitor’ and ‘investigate  further’, with capital planning cycle integration  for ‘must do’ items.   primary adaptation actions focus on incorporating  adaptation as a consideration or key driver into  existing and planned projects. they include:  •  Completing a comprehensive integrated   Stormwater Management plan and continuing  with sewer separation;  • Completing a coastal flood risk assessment;  • Amending flood-proofing policies;   • Completing an urban forest management plan;  •  including climate change adaptation measures  in the next Vancouver Building Bylaw update;  • developing a back-up power policy; and  • implementing water conservation actions.  the Strategy is a living document and will continue   to be revised and updated as climate change  science and adaptation practice evolve. As this  is the first Adaptation Strategy for Vancouver,  many of the proposed actions focus on increasing   our understanding of coming challenges and   integrating climate change into planning, design  and emergency management.   ExECuTivE Summary    2  ClimaTE ChaNGE iS clearly supported by both observed trends and peer reviewed  scientific research. Some climate change is now inevitable and there is evidence  the world over that changes are already taking place. global mitigation   efforts are underway to curb greenhouse gas emissions, but unless concerted   action happens soon, further and more extreme changes may become   unavoidable. preparing for these changes –adapting to climate change –   is a warranted and complementary strategy. the City of Vancouver is a   recognized leader in climate change mitigation, and adding adaptation to our  business will ensure that we can continue to meet City goals cost effectively  over time.   Scientists project that Vancouver will experience increased annual precipitation   and temperatures, with hotter, drier summers. More intense and frequent  rain and wind storms are anticipated and sea level rise will pose a significant  challenge by mid-century. these changes mean an increasing risk of overland  and coastal flooding, damage from storms and overheating during summer  highs. Without action, these risks threaten a wide spectrum of City goals  from economic prosperity to liveability.  Vancouver is joining a group of leading cities in europe, Australia and the United  States that have developed and implemented climate change adaptation actions.  Vancouver’s Adaptation Strategy is a priority action in both the greenest  City plan and the Corporate Strategic Business plan. the City joined the  iCLei Climate Change Adaptation initiative pilot in late 2010 along with a  cohort of local and regional governments across Canada. participants work  through iCLei’s five milestone methodology with the goal of developing and  implementing a climate change adaptation strategy over two years.  this Adaptation Strategy focuses on understanding the climate impacts today  and how they are expected to change in the coming century. it provides a  framework for identifying and prioritizing vulnerabilities and risks and then  exploring measures to reduce the risk imposed by climate impacts. it will  guide development of policies and programs to build resiliency into everyday  operations and short and long-term infrastructure investments. Accountability  for the actions lies primarily with the City but also with external partners.  We need to maintain or enhance the infrastructure, programs and services  that make Vancouver one of the most liveable cities in the world, even as  storms worsen and sea levels increase.   the Strategy is a living document and will continue to be revised and updated   as climate change science and adaptation practice evolves. As this is the  first Adaptation Strategy for Vancouver, many of the proposed actions focus  on increasing our understanding of coming challenges and integrating climate  change into planning, design and emergency management. Successive iterations   of the Strategy will yield more detailed actions.  Many adaptation activities are already in place at the City driven by the need   to manage observed climate changes, or to meet sustainability imperatives  such as water conservation. this Strategy takes a “no regrets” approach to  climate policy by identifying actions that build on these existing activities to  improve community resiliency and generate benefits whether the extent of  anticipated climate change materializes or not.   the Strategy begins with an overview and context for adaptation in Vancouver   including adaptation basics and Vancouver’s future climate (chapters one   to three). Chapter four focuses on understanding the impacts and the cross-  cutting issues they represent. Chapter five identifies the primary and supporting  actions with a companion comprehensive action matrix located in Appendix A.   A brief description of plan implementation and maintenance procedures  conclude the plan.   iNTrODuCTiON    3  Strategy ViSion:   to ensure that Vancouver remains a liveable and resilient city, maintaining   its values, character and charm in the face of climate change.  guiDing PrinCiPleS:  •  Use the best science available at the time of planning and review regularly.   •  promote flexible and adaptive management approaches that leave a range  of future options available.  •  give priority to adaptation strategies that build on existing programs or  policies and provide co-benefits with mitigation and sustainability goals.   •  Aim for integration into department business, “mainstreaming”, versus  entirely new-staffed projects.  •  establish and maintain strong networks with First nations and other levels  of government as well as with partners such as the port, the Board of  trade and the Vancouver economic Commission.   •  Adaptation efforts should be mindful of, and include, planning to meet   the unique needs and conditions of people who are most vulnerable.   goalS:  development and implementation of this strategy will:  •  increase the resilience of City infrastructure, programs and services   to anticipated local climate change impacts.  •  promote and facilitate the incorporation of climate change information  into City business.   •  improve awareness, knowledge, skills and resources of City staff.  •  enhance opportunities for coordination and cooperation through   the development of networks and partnerships.

Adaptation refers to actions taken to respond to  the impacts of climate change by taking advantage   of opportunities or reducing the associated risks.  examples of adaptation actions include modifi- cations of coastal development to account for  sea level rise, provision of heat refuges during  heat waves, planting hardy or suitable plants and  dealing with increases in beach erosion.   Mitigation and adaptation are not mutually   exclusive, with many actions contributing to both  goals. examples include water conservation and  effective building envelopes which reduce gHgs  now, but also mitigate the effects of extended  hotter, drier weather in the future. Sustainability  goals in general, as detailed in the greenest City  plan, have extensive overlap with adaptation and  mitigation actions. integration of the Adaptation  Strategy with greenest City plan actions was  completed in development of this strategy.   1.2  role of loCal goVernment   in aDaPtation  it is widely recognized that adaptation is most  effective at the regional and community scale.  exposure to hazards, vulnerability, adaptive   capacity and risk are all place-based in nature and   many of the impacts anticipated from climate  change will affect the services and infrastructure  for which local governments have the primary    responsibility. Local governments also have  many of the tools necessary for adaptation such  as planning, codes, standards and emergency  response.   Local governments also invest in capital projects  and programs that are expected to serve the City  over many decades. given current replacement  rates, new buildings will account for an equal or  greater fraction of building stock within climate  change timeframes. the cost of no action, both  from a future retrofit and public safety perspective,   could be much higher than proactively planning  infrastructure to be resilient to future climate.   the cost to build a new house, bridge or trans- mission line that is adapted to climate change for  its lifecycle will only add 0% to 5% to construction   costs which is significantly cheaper than restoring   infrastructure post damage, retrofitting, rebuilding   or an increased lifetime maintenance bill.1 economic   value at risk from climate change was estimated   at between 1% and 12% of gdp by 2030 for   various global locations. the same study found  that between 40% and 68% of these losses could  be averted through adaptation measures for  which economic benefits outweigh costs.2 the  national round table on the environment and  the economy completed a cost benefit analysis  of implementing proactive adaptation actions  versus dealing with the consequences when they  occur. they concluded that adaptation was a  cost effective way of dealing with many climate  change impacts.3 According to a recent University   of Waterloo research project, climate change  adaptation is “simply good and smart business  for Canada”.4   CHApter 1 aDaPtation in VanCouVer  mitigation prevent climate   change  aDaPtation respond to the   impacts of climate  change  figure 1: mitigation and adaptation to Climate Change    5  Local governments have a duty of care to their  citizens to ensure development decisions do not  create the potential for unmanageable exposure  to hazards. they also have a special responsibility  to those members of society who are more   vulnerable to impacts from climate change.   to adapt to climate change, local governments  will have to alter their traditional regulatory and  design regimes to incorporate future projections  into decision-making. Many north American cities  are well on their way to doing this and Vancouver’s   efforts start here.  1.3 aDaPtation DefinitionS:  adaptation: in human systems, adaptation is  the process of adjustment to actual or expected  climate and its effects, in order to moderate harm  or exploit beneficial opportunities.5 Adaptation is  a function of Vulnerability and risk.   Vulnerability: is the degree to which a system is  susceptible to, or unable to cope with a particular   climate change impact. it is a function of the  character, magnitude and rate of climate variation   to which a system is exposed; its sensitivity and  its adaptive capacity.6  Vulnerability =  exposure x Sensitivity x adaptive Capacity  exposure and Sensitivity: are almost inseparable   properties of a system (or community). A coastal    community like Vancouver is exposed to sea level  rise while an okanagan community may be ex- posed to drought. Sensitivity is the degree to which    the system is affected. At the municipal level, iCLei   suggests assessing sensitivity by considering   existing stresses that make a department sensitive   and how much the performance or function of an   area may be affected by a climate change impact.   adaptive Capacity: is similar to, or closely related   to, a host of other commonly used concepts,   including adaptability, coping ability, management   capacity, stability, flexibility and resilience. the  determinants of adaptive capacity are the forces  that influence the ability of the system to adapt  such as managerial ability; access to financial,  technological and information resources; infra- structure; institutional environment; political   influence; kinship networks, etc. Adaptive capacity   is context-specific and varies from community   to community and among social groups and   individuals, and over time.7  Vulnerability assessment: the process to prioritize   climate change risks focusing on where we  are the most susceptible. Vulnerability is a key  determinant of potential impacts and disasters.  For example, a heat wave can have very different  impacts on distinctive populations depending on  their vulnerability.   Climate Change risk: is a combined function of  the probability of a hazard (an event with the  potential to cause harm, e.g. floods, droughts)  occurring and the magnitude or severity of its  potential consequences (injury, damage, loss   of habitat etc.). 8  risk =  likelihood (probability) x Consequence  risk assessment: the process to prioritize  climate change risks focusing on the potential  consequences of an impact.   Disaster risk management: improving the under- standing of disaster risk; fostering disaster risk   reduction and transfer; and promoting continuous   improvement in disaster preparedness, response,  and recovery practices, with the explicit purpose  of increasing human security, well-being, quality  of life, resilience, and sustainable development .9  resilience: resilience is the ability of a system  and its component parts to anticipate, absorb,  accommodate, or recover from the effects of a  hazardous event in a timely and efficient manner,  including ensuring the preservation, restoration,  or improvement of its essential basic structures  and functions.10  5 intergovernmental panel on Climate Change (ipCC), 2011. 6 ipCC, 2001 7  Smit, Barry and Johanna Wandel. 2006.

As participants in the iCLei Adaptation initiative, Vancouver followed the  five-milestone methodology outlined in the aforementioned guidebook.   the purpose of the methodology is to convey a holistic, straightforward   approach for municipalities to investigate climate change impacts and   devise strategies for addressing these impacts.   there are generally two recognized approaches to adaptation planning:  impact assessment and vulnerability assessment. impact assessments  are described as top down; working from the identification of anticipated  impacts. Vulnerability assessments are bottom up; identifying areas where  the community is sensitive and exposed to change. Both vulnerability and  impact assessments can sit comfortably within a broad risk assessment  framework –a systematic methodology to identify, assess, communicate   and manage risks. the iCLei milestones follow a risk assessment format.   the Five iCLei Milestones are: initiate, research, plan, implement and Monitor/  iterate. Figure 2 below outlines the main questions addressed in each milestone.   note that this Strategy is a result of Milestones one to three. Milestones 4  and 5 follow adoption of the Strategy.   2.2 the aDaPtation team:  deputy City Manager, Sadhu Johnston, played an important role as Adaptation  Champion. He helped solidify awareness and commitment to adaptation  planning within the organization and communicated our work to external  stakeholders and partners. City engineer, peter Judd, our executive sponsor,   was also integral as an avid supporter of preparing for the impacts of climate   change and ensuring resilient infrastructure over time.   An inter-departmental working group on adaptation was established in 2008   when initial investigation was completed. the group was re-convened in 2011  to support work on the iCLei adaptation process. the Adaptation Working   group completed many of the worksheets and tasks associated with the  milestones and provided a link back to their respective departments. A sea   level rise working group and adaptation steering committee were both   established late in the planning process as the need arose. Many staff members   were involved throughout the adaptation planning process from identifying  impacts to prioritizing and reviewing actions.

Milestone 4  Implement    7  2.3 VanCouVer ProCeSS  Figure 3 below outlines the main actions carried out in the adaptation   planning process.   in Milestone one, general managers from across the organization were inter- viewed to introduce them to the planning effort and garner their initial feedback   on impacts and department specific actions. research on anticipated changes   to climate variables (rain, wind, temperature) was presented as a basis for  impact identification by the gMs and subsequently by the working group.  Milestone one also included a scan of existing policies, programs, plans and  bylaws to identify existing adaptation actions and opportunities to include  adaptation considerations.  Milestone two focused on the risk and vulnerability assessments which were  completed by the working group (see section 2.4). Starting with over 80  identified impacts, the assessments prioritized the list to just over twenty key   impacts. in collaboration with iCLei and pCiC, the georgia Basin Adaptation  initiative participants commissioned a study of regional climate science to  support adaptation planning.   identification and prioritization of adaptation actions dominated milestone  three. departmental workshops focused on brainstorming actions to respond   to, or minimize the risk imposed by impacts affecting the department.  Workshops included a mapping exercise to identify assets vulnerable to   sea level rise and voting to categorize actions from low hanging fruit to  complex. in order to focus detail on appropriate actions, the working group  evaluated all actions against a set of criteria (see section 2.5). iterations of  review ensured departments were involved throughout the process.   2.4 Strategy DeVeloPment  the vulnerability and risk assessments were the primary tool used in Strategy   development. the assessments focused this round of adaptation planning on   those impacts that we are the most susceptible to, and that will have the  greatest consequences. please refer to Appendix B for more detailed information   from the vulnerability and risk assessment.   2.4.1 VulneraBility aSSeSSment  Vulnerability refers to the susceptibility of a given service area to harm arising   from climate change impacts. it is a function of a department’s sensitivity to  climate change and its capacity to adapt to impacts with little to no cost or  disruption. Medium and high vulnerability impacts are moved on to the risk  assessment.   Vulnerability =  Sensitivity x adaptive Capacity   Sensitivity  to conduct a sensitivity assessment, Vancouver’s Adaptation Working group  looked at each identified impact and assessed how the functionality of the  primary department would be affected if the impact were to occur. Vancouver   decided to look at the sensitivity of the primary department between now  and 2080. Sensitivity was ranked on a scale of 1 to 5.   adaptive Capacity   inherent to the analysis of adaptive capacity is the assumption that certain  systems can accommodate changes in climate with minimal disruption or  additional cost. those systems which cannot accommodate changes have   a low adaptive capacity.   figure 3: The City of vancouver’s adaptation Planning Process  Milestone 1  GM Interviews  Climate Science  ID existing adaptations and impacts (WG)  Risk and  Vulnerability Assessment  PCIC Climate Science Project  Dept. Actions ID Workshops  WG Action Evaluation  Sr. Sta Vet Draft Actions  Milestone 2 Milestone 3 Draft Plan    8  in order to measure Vancouver’s adaptive capacity, impacts were assessed  based on the cost and amount of staff intervention that would be needed  to adapt. engineering was most frequently identified as having low adaptive  capacity; a direct reflection of how built infrastructure is generally unable to  accommodate major changes in climate without additional costs and potentially  significant disruptions.   given sensitivity and adaptive capacity, vulnerability is ranked as follows.  2.4.2 riSk aSSeSSment  risk is a function of the likelihood and consequence of an impact where   likelihood refers to the probability of the projected impact occurring, and  consequence refers to the known or estimated effects (economic, ecological,   social or legal) of a particular impact.   risk = likelihood x Consequence  likelihood   to determine the likelihood, Vancouver characterized the impact as a single  event (windstorm) or a recurring event (increasing annual rainfall). A likelihood   rating from 1 to 5 was then assigned where 1 is “rare” and 5 is “almost certain”.  Consequence   the second step of a risk assessment is to evaluate the consequence of an   impact. Using a relatively common risk assessment matrix, Vancouver looked   at how the impacts would affect five areas: public safety, local economy and  growth, community and lifestyle, environment and sustainability, and public  administration. Matrix ratings ranged from 1 (negligible) to 5 (catastrophic).  the sum of all the consequence values was then totalled to give the impact  an overall consequence rating.   Consequence and likelihood are then multiplied to obtain a risk rating on the  following scale.   2.5  eValuation of aDaPtation aCtionS   Workshops were held with staff across the organization to brainstorm actions   to prepare for, or reduce risks from, the prioritized impacts. Workshop   participants then reviewed a consolidated list of potential actions before   the working group evaluated them. Criteria from the Canadian Communities’  guidebook for Adaptation to Climate Change were used to rank the actions.  the criteria and ranking descriptions are listed in table 1.   Actions with low scores were discussed and most often discarded. others were   ranked into the following categories: “must do”, “monitor” or “investigate  further”. Must do actions are those that have a high benefit to cost ratio  and those with a short time horizon until impacts are likely to be observed.  in consultation with staff, must do actions were further prioritized by date  of the capital planning cycle they will be implemented by. Actions that are   5-20 Very Low  21-35 Low  36-50 Medium  Low  51-65 Medium  66-80 Medium  High  81-95 High  96-110 Very High  111-125 Extreme  figure 5: risk assessment ranking scale  figure 4: vulnerability calculations  Low Adaptive Capacity  High Adaptive Capacity  High Adaptive Capacity  High Sensitivity  Low Sensitivity  High Sensitivity  High Vulnerability  Low Vulnerability  Medium Vulnerability    9  tagged as “monitor” are actions that have good benefit to cost ratio but given   long timelines until anticipated impacts, it makes sense to wait to implement  these actions until certain thresholds of climate change are observed. Lastly,  “investigate further” are actions where the benefit to cost ratio is unclear  and more consideration is required.   figure 6: Categories used to prioritize adaptation actions  Category Criteria 1 (low) 2 (medium) 3 (high)  Sustainability  Mitigation  co-benefits  result in increased  gHg emissions  Would not affect  gHg emissions  Would reduce  greenhouse gas  emissions  equity Benefits to few  people  Benefits to many  people  Significant  benefits to many  people  implemen- tation Cost  Cost is high  relative to cost of  inaction  Cost is moderate  relative to cost of  inaction  Cost is low relative   to cost of inaction  effectiveness robustness effective for a   narrow range of  plausible future  scenarios  effective across  many plausible  future scenarios  effective across  a wide range of  plausible future  scenarios  risk and   uncertainty  Urgency risks are likely  to occur in the  longer term  impacts are likely  in the near to mid  term  impacts are   already occurring  opportunity  Ancillary   benefits  Will contribute  little if not at all   to other City goals  and programs  Will contribute  somewhat to other  City goals and  programs  Will contribute  significantly to  other City goals  and programs  no regret Will have little  or no benefit if  climate change  impacts do not  occur  Will have some  benefits regardless  of actual climate  change impacts  Will result in sig- nificant benefits  regardless of  actual climate  change impacts  Window of  opportunity  there is no   window currently  A window of  opportunity could  be created  A window of  opportunity exists  to implement  implementation  Funding   Sources  external funding  sources are   required but   have not been  identified  external funding  sources are   required and   likely to be   secured  Funding is   available   externally or  internally  institutional implementation  requires coordi- nation with, or  action by other  jurisdictions  implementation   requires external   approval  implementation  is within local  control  table 1: adaptation action evaluation criteria  Actions relating to climate impacts already being observed or that have  a life safety component and actions with a high benefit to cost ratio.

Climate  change is the trend information that remains once   the fluctuations of these natural cycles is removed.   Historical observations reveal the trends while global   and regional climate models provide insight into  anticipated future climate.   Climate is expected to change both in terms of  annual and seasonal averages and in the frequency,   intensity, duration and timing of extreme events.  in B.C, 2011 was 0.51°C warmer than 1951-1980   average values, and was ranked the ninth warmest   year since 1880, with nine of the ten warmest  years on record occurring since year 2000.11   in terms of extreme events, a 3-hour heavy rainfall  event that occurred on average once every 25 years   in the past is projected to occur five and a half  times more frequently by 2050.   3.1 gloBal Climate Change  the intergovernmental panel on Climate Change  released its first Special report on Managing  the risks of extreme events and disasters to  Advance Climate Change Adaptation (SreX) on  March 28th, 2012. the following are conclusions  from the report.   •  Warming of the climate system is unequivocal,  as is now evident from observations of increases  in global average air and ocean temperatures,  widespread melting of snow and ice and rising  global average sea level.  •  there is high agreement and much evidence  that with current climate change mitigation  policies and related sustainable development  practices, global gHg emissions will continue  to grow over the next few decades.  •  observational evidence from all continents and  most oceans shows that many natural systems  are being affected by regional climate changes,  particularly temperature increases.  the ipCC rates the likelihood of projected trends  for the 21st century as follows:  •  Virtually certain (>99% likelihood) that decreases   in frequency and magnitude of cold extremes  will occur.   •  1 in 20 year extreme daily temperature (exceeded   once between 1981 and 2000) is likely (>66%  likelihood) to become a 1 in 2 or 1 in 5 year event.  •  Very likely (>90% likelihood) that mean sea  level rise will contribute to upward trends in  extreme coastal high water levels in the future.  •  Likely that the frequency of heavy precipitation  or the proportion of total rainfall from heavy  events will increase.  •  1 in 20 year annual maximum daily precipitation  amount is likely to become a 1 in 5 to 1 in 15 year   event by the end of the century.  3.2  regional anD loCal Climate  Change   3.2.1 oVerView  the pacific Climate impacts Consortium (pCiC)  at the University of Victoria completed a study  of regional projections for all georgia Basin iCLei  Adaptation initiative participants.

A general study  finding was that projected change by the 2050s  appears modest while by the 2080s projected  change describes a future climate that is almost  unrecognizable in comparison to historical climate.   ChaPter 3 Climate Change SCienCe  11 pacific Climate impacts Consortium and ipCC     11  the following climate variables were modelled by   pCiC for the region. they are all described against  a 1961-1990 baseline unless otherwise stated.   Precipitation as Snow: Vancouver’s drinking  water comes from mountain reservoirs and the  snowpack melt and rainfall that supply them.  April 1 snowpack has decreased on average by  25% in BC over the past 50 years with some sites  experiencing a 50% reduction.12   precipitation as snow is projected to decrease in  the areas of Metro Vancouver that are important  for water supply. reductions will be evident by  the 2050s and precipitation as snow is projected  almost to disappear by 2080.   growing Degree Days: growing degree days  (gdd) are an important indicator of opportunities   for agriculture but may also increase the risk of  invasive species spread. they are determined by  the accumulation of degrees over 5°C per day.  Annual gdds are a sum of degrees accumulated   this way for each day of the year. regionally,  modeled gdds are projected to increase by   approximately one to two thirds in the 2050s and  to as much as double by the 2080s from a baseline  of approximately 1700 degree days.   annual heating and Cooling degree days: Heating   and cooling degree days are useful indicators  of energy demands required for heating and  cooling. HVAC systems, general building design,  district energy systems and other energy infra- structure all rely on this information. An approximate  25% and 35% reduction by the 2050s and 2080s  respectively in heating degree-days signals a   significant reduction in cold season energy   requirements.   Climate Variable Summary of Change Snapshot of anticipated Changes  increase in average  annual precipitation  with a decrease in  the summer.  averagesA  increase of 6% and 9% in winter and decrease of 15% and 14% in the  summer by the 2050s and 2080s respectively.   wet days B, C   By the 2050s, precipitation during extremely wet days is expected  to increase 28% relative to the baseline period (1971-2000).  extreme eventsC  By the 2050s, a daily rainfall event that occurred once every 25  years in the past is expected to occur almost 2.5 times as frequently.  increase in average  annual temperature  with most notable  change in night-time  lows.   averagesA   Annual increase of 1.7°C by the 2050s and 2.7°C by the 2080s.  warm days   Summer days above approx. 24°C are projected to occur more than  twice as frequently in the 2050s than during the baseline period  1971-2000.  extreme events  in the 2050s, an extreme heat event that occurred once every 25  years in the past is expected to occur over 3 times as frequently.  rising Seas  averages  the province of B.C. recommends using 0.5m global mean sea level  increase to 2050, 1.0m to 2100 and 2.0m to 2200. there is a wide  range of projections for sea level rise by 2100 from 45cm to over 2m.  extreme events  Sea level rise will cause problems when experienced together with  storm surge. detailed storm surge projections are not available.  An increase in extreme events is projected including windstorms  and heavy rainfall.   A Average change based on 30 global Climate Model projections.

Climateoverview.Mar2009.pdf  table 2: Snapshot of projected changes in climate for Vancouver    12  As temperatures climb, cooling degree days increase. From a historical baseline   of only 55 cooling degree-days annually in Metro Vancouver, projected  increases range from at least double by the 2050s to as much as a factor of  10 increase by the 2080s. Alternatives to vast application of air conditioning  will need promotion in order to avoid adaptation that increases greenhouse  gas emissions.  Summer day-time high temps: projected increases in summer day-time  high temperatures indicate a summer climate by the 2050s between that   of present-day Seattle and San diego.  frost free Period: Freeze-thaw can be hard on vegetation and infrastructure   alike. the frost free period in the urban parts of the study area are already  quite high with the majority of the year (roughly 200 days/year) frost free  on average during the 1961-1990 period. projections indicate a new normal  by the 2080s of virtually frost free conditions.   fraser river hydrology: the portion of the Fraser contiguous with Vancouver   is tidally dominated. nevertheless, changes in runoff timing and the seasonal   distribution of runoff could have implications for water availability and habitat.   By the 2050s winter and spring flows are projected to increase by 56% to 85%   and 37% to 56% respectively and summer flow to decrease by 13% to 23%  for the Fraser- Hope hydrometric station. the mean annual peak flow is  projected to occur about 10 days earlier.13   3.2.2 extremeS:   the head of climate monitoring and attribution at the U.K’s Hadley centre for   Climate Change, explains that for every 1 degree Celsius rise in temperature,   the amount of moisture that the atmosphere can contain rises by 7% or more.  “the upshot is that overall rainfall increases only 2% to 3% per degree of warming,   where extreme rainfall increases 6% to 7%”.14 in basic terms, this is due to the   large-scale energy balance of the planet. With extra moisture in the atmosphere,  when precipitation does occur, it’s more likely to be in bigger events.   Current observations support an increase in storm intensity. toronto recently   initiated a program to improve storm drains after experiencing eight extreme   storms (more than 1 in 25 year intensity) between 1986 and 2006. the  insurance Bureau of Canada states that severe storm-related water damage  has doubled since 1992 to 44% of claims.15   pCiC used eight regional Climate Models (rCMs) to project changes in extremes.  the projected change from the 1971-2000 baseline period is projected for  the 2050s (2041-2070) in all cases. in the case of warm days (table 3,   first row), the ratio can be interpreted as warm days occurring 2.2 times   as frequently by the 2050s.  extreme precipitation is projected to increase for all the precipitation indices.   the percent of annual total precipitation that falls during events that are larger   than the 95th percentile of events in the past is projected to increase by  about 21% on average (table 3, row 2). percent of annual total precipitation  falling during events larger than the 99th percentile of past events is projected   to increase by 28% on average (table 3, row3).   index units min average max  Warm days: 90th percentile   temperatures for each day of the  year relative to the baseline.   ratio 1.8 2.2 3.0  Very wet day precipitation:   95th percentile of all rain days.   % change 2 21 43  extremely wet day precipitation:  99th percentile of all rain days.   % change -23 28 92  Heaviest precipitation day in   September: average of max. precip.   on a September day averaged over  the baseline period.  % change -10 25% 47%  13 (pCiC Update Vol V number 3.

Scienftific American. 15 (piCS newsletter nov. 29)  3.2.3 return PerioDS:  rCM projections were also used to provide an estimate of how return  periods are expected to change by 2050. A return period (or recurrence  interval) is an estimate of the interval of time between events (earthquakes,  floods) of a certain intensity of size. the table below shows the ratio of  future to past return periods. For example, the median value of 5.8 for the   table 3: Summary of projected annual changes in 2050 from the 1971-2000  baseline for all eight rCm runs and all months except for warm days which are  given for summer and heaviest precipitation days indicated for September.     13  25th return period for 3 hourly precipitation (highlighted) indicates that an  event that occurred every 25 years during the past (4% chance of occurring  each year) is expected to occur almost six times more frequently by 2050.  in Metro Vancouver, 5-, 10-, and 25- year return period daytime high hot events   are projected to occur 2.4, 2.8, and 3.2 times as often, respectively. return  periods for wet events are projected to occur 1.6, 1.9, and 2.5 times as often,  respectively.  during the last century sea level rose by almost 8” (20 cm). What is most  notable is that the rate of rise is increasing rapidly, almost doubling in the  last three decades.16 Based on present and expected increases in emissions  in the near future, sea levels are expected to rise at accelerating rates into  the next century. Close monitoring and measurement over the last fifteen  years has shown that the present trend is close to, or above, the upper   envelope of global scenarios.   projections for sea level cover a range, with greater weighting in the middle,  as in most probability curves. Moderate projections for global average sea  level rise this century are approximately 3 feet (1 m), but a few recent papers  have raised the upper limit to 6 feet (2 m). Such forecasts are regularly  revised and have generally moved upward over the last decade as the extent  of melting in greenland and Antarctica increased.17 Jurisdictions around the   world are using various sea level rise figures in planning to the end of the  21st century. the new Zealand Ministry of environment is suggesting a 0.8m   increase in areas where impacts will have high consequences. the U.S Army  Corps uses 1m and 1.5m for low and high scenarios respectively; the delta  Committee of the netherlands uses a range from 0.55m to 1.2m and the Lowe   Study for the U.K released 2.5m as the upper limit of scenarios by 2100.   in May, 2011 the BC Ministry of environment released draft guidelines providing   sea level rise figures for use in evaluation of existing dikes, flood-proofing  requirements and long term land use and planning issues. in formulating the  guidelines, the province created a sea level change envelope reflecting the  ranges of the most recent peer reviewed scientific projections. they chose  a median curve as the basis for defining policy in BC that translates to the  figures in table 5 below.

At the regional and local scale, sea level   will also be affected by local ocean and weather characteristics such as   salinity, wind and currents, and by the vertical movement of the land due   to geological processes (subsidence and uplift).  table 4: return period projections (regional median)  table 5: BC ministry of environment sea level rise planning figures    14  CHApter 4 imPaCTS aND iSSuES  aNTiCiPaTED ChaNGES TO climate variables, as   described in Chapter 3, will cause impacts felt  across City departments. An example of a climate   change impact is increased street flooding caused   by increases in intensity and duration of rainfall.   impacts share common overarching themes  that are briefly discussed in this chapter to help  decision-makers, working on these policy areas,  identify climate risks and opportunities.   4.1 imPaCtS  From Chapter 3, the most relevant climate change   impacts Vancouver will experience are:  •  Flooding and/or inundation due to sea level rise;  •  overland flooding due to increased frequency  and intensity of precipitation;  •  damage from increased frequency and intensity  of wind and rain storms; and  •  Health impacts from more days of extreme  warm temperatures and heat waves.  overall changes in climate trends such as warmer,  drier summers and more extreme events will also  cause impacts. See table 6 for all the prioritized  impacts.   Several Vancouver characteristics standout as  significant vulnerabilities to climate change   which in turn drive adaptation priorities.   •  Lower income households; the homeless and  those housed in poor quality housing are   particularly vulnerable to climate change and  natural hazards due to where they live within  cities, the lack of reliable basic services, and their  shortage of resources to deal with disruption.   •  Low-lying coastal and Fraser-fronting areas   include significant infrastructure, neighbourhoods,  ecosystems and are central to Vancouver’s   aesthetic and amenity-centred charm.   table 6 summarizes the impacts that were prior-  itized through the vulnerability and risk assessments.  impacts are organized by the expected climate  change (high level impact in the case of sea level   rise). the general changes category includes  impacts felt from a collection of the other climate  changes.   4.2 CroSS-Cutting iSSueS  the following discussion briefly touches on the  issues common to many climate change impacts,  highlighting focus areas for adaptation planning.   4.2.1 infraStruCture  infrastructure assets provide a significant oppor-  tunity for adaptation. they have long operational   lifetimes, meaning they will be exposed to both  current and future climate. infrastructure in Canada   is relatively vulnerable to climate change as it   is aging and over-used with population and  development pressures increasing associated  expectations for service.   Weathering of infrastructure can occur via biological   (mould), chemical (corrosion), thermal (freeze- thaw) or mechanical agents (wind-driven rain);  all of which will be affected by climate change.  damage to infrastructure from extreme weather   events tends to increase dramatically above   critical thresholds. environment Canada reported   that a 25% increase in peak wind gust can generate   a 650% increase in building damage claims.18  Aside from direct changes to weather conditions,  climate change will also affect patterns of supply  and consumer demand. For example, higher  summer temperatures may increase demand for  transportation to beaches and mountains, while  increased severe weather may affect supply  chains and resources that infrastructure and   repair companies rely on.   Maladapted infrastructure will have indirect   impacts in the way of asset management costs,   insurance claims and negative effects on reputation.   A Vancouver rainstorm in 2010 resulted in 173  filed claims with the City and a 2005 rainstorm  in toronto ranks as the second largest insurance  payout in Canadian history. An ontario-specific  study predicted the following increases in insured  losses due to rainfall related water damage: 13%,  20% and 30% for the 2020s, 2050s and 2080s  respectively.19   18 Auld, Heather and Maciver, don. 2007.

Although heat stress may appear less threatening in BC compared to the  rest of the country, much of the BC population is less acclimatized to   temperatures above 30 °C. non-respiratory emergency room visits in Van- couver currently increase with high summer temperatures and are expected  to rise further with an aging population.   Airborne pollutants cause wheezing, asthma attacks and impaired lung  function, and are associated with increased respiratory illness, stroke, and  heart attack.21 the national roundtable on the environment and the econo- my reported that poorer air quality resulting from higher temperatures will  lead to more hospital visits and millions of dollars in costs to local health  care systems for Canada’s four major cities – toronto, Montreal, Vancouver  and Calgary.    17  4.2.3 haBitat, ParkS anD greenSPaCe  the preservation and expansion of trees and greenspaces in Vancouver  contributes to both climate change mitigation and adaptation. Vegetation  absorbs carbon, helps keep the city cooler in the summer and increases the  amount of groundwater recharge, thereby lowering flood risk.   Urban structures such as asphalt and buildings absorb more solar energy   than grass and trees increasing the local temperature – a phenomenon known   as the urban heat island effect. Vegetation in the downtown helps decrease this  effect, providing a safer environment health wise and lowering the need for  air conditioning. Models have shown areas like airports with a high proportion  of pavement can be almost 9°C warmer than areas with heavy vegetation  cover such as parks.  parks and greenspace can also play an important role in decreasing the impacts   or occurrence of flooding from heavy rainfall or storm surge. parks can be  used for detention and infiltration of stormwater or as containment areas   for heavy storm surge.   Beyond the number of trees and greenspaces in the City, the health of the  urban ecosystems is paramount. Climate change is predicted to exacerbate  undesirable agents of rapid change such as invasive pests or indigenous pests  which are opportunistic to new environmental stress. Monitoring is essential  to ward off major problems before they exceed our ability to control them.   Habitats found within the urban landscapes are often characterized as  habitat islands within a sea or buildings. Climate change will exacerbate the  implications of habitat isolation necessitating a renewed effort to increase  habitat connectivity.   the Stanley park Management plan includes considerations for climate change   such as ‘wind-proofing’, appropriate site selection/ planting practices, species  selection and pest monitoring. these considerations will need to be applied  to other urban greenspaces and trees including development landscape plans,   street trees and trees on private property.   4.2.4 eConomy  Climate change can be thought of as a pervasive economic shock that will  potentially affect all sectors of the economy.22 Both goods movement and  local business are likely to be affected by climate change and associated sea  level rise with the potential to compromise Vancouver’s and the province’s  economy. it is important to consider the economic advantages climate  change may provide as well. Warmer summers may attract more tourists  and longer growing seasons allow for new agriculture crops in the region.   the national round table on the environment and the economy (nrtee)  found that world-wide greenhouse gas emissions and subsequent climate  change impacts could, in turn, have an economic impact on Canada of   $5 billion annually by 2020 and between $21 and $43 billion annually by 2050.   Specific to BC by the 2050s, timber supply impacts could range from $2 billion  to $17 billion annually and flooding damages to coastal dwellings could cost  between $1 billion to $8 billion per year. the report concluded that ignoring  climate change now will cost us more in the long run and that adaptation is  a cost-effective way to alleviate many of the impacts of climate change.23   An international cost benefit study echoed the nrtee findings, reporting that  between 40% and 68% of the loss in gdp expected to 2030 (under severe  climate change scenarios) could be averted through adaptation measures  for which economic benefits outweigh their costs.24  20  World Bank. 2011.

Community risks are business risks as they depend   on local services and infrastructure to run their   businesses. Businesses are already on the frontline   of climate change with bottom lines increasingly  at risk due to weather and climate phenomena.  impacts to businesses from climate change can  be categorized into physical and operational   impacts such as decreased availability or increased   price of critical materials; regulatory and legal  risks such as new land use zoning or building  changes; financing risks such as access to capital   for businesses at high risk to climate change;  market changes; and reputational risks.26 it will   be imperative for businesses to demonstrate   a commitment to adaptation, raise awareness  and collaborate through new forms of public-  private partnerships to tackle the most complex  challenges of adaptation.27   4.2.5 CoaStal Zone  thirty eight percent of the Canadian population lives   within 20km of a coast or great lake shoreline.28  Coastal areas are exceptionally vulnerable to sea  level rise given that they are home to concentrated   populations, economic centres and valuable eco- systems. Coastal industry remains integral to the  transportation and transfer of goods.   A 2008 oeCd report ranked Vancouver 15th out  of 136 large port cities in terms of the value of  assets exposed to sea level rise.29 BtA Works, the  research arm of a local architecture firm, found  that industrial lands, historic areas and the public  realm would be affected disproportionally in a  5m sea level rise scenario. Conversion of these  industrial lands to residential areas is likely to   increase the consequences of a flood. the national   round table on the environment and the economy   predicted sea level rise to cause between $2.1 billion   and $7.6 billion in damages by 2050 for BC   (primarily Metro Vancouver) based on a sea level  rise of 0.28m to 0.85m by 2100. they estimate  that $25 billion worth of real estate (not including   City infrastructure) would be heavily impacted with  the cost of sufficient protective measures such as  earth dikes or seawalls estimated to range from  $255 million to $510 million (2011 dollars).  recognized adaptation responses to sea level rise   can be grouped into four broad categories as  follows:  •  Protect: protect the coastline through structural   mechanisms such as dikes and seawalls.  •  accommodate: increase flood construction  levels, add covenants for liability reduction   and retrofit existing buildings.  •  Planned retreat: withdraw, relocate or abandon   private or public assets due to coastal hazard.  •  avoid: identify future ‘no build’ zones or use land   acquisition or restriction tools such as land trusts.   the United Kingdom is a leader in coastal flood  risk management. planning follows three broad  steps: preliminary flood risk assessment; flood  hazard mapping; and adoption of a flood risk  management plan aimed at prevention, protection   and preparedness.   26  Un environment programme.

Where there are no primary   actions to address a climate change, only a   suite of supporting actions are introduced.   primary actions, supporting actions and more  detailed actions are listed with accountability   and timing information in a comprehensive   Adaptation Action Matrix found in Appendix A.  the matrix is organized by impacts under the  same section headings as the chapter below.   no-regret actions are the focus – those that  build on existing plans and actions and provide  community benefits regardless of the extent of  climate change experienced. each objective is   achieved through a combination of different   actions which act together. these portfolios   of actions generally include measures from   the following four categories:   •  modifying policies, plans, procedures, standards   (e.g. by-laws, development plans, operating  practices, codes);   • building new or upgrading infrastructure;   •  improving community awareness and   education; and  •  varying/diversifying existing actions (e.g. diver- sifying energy supplies, diversifying plantings).  the actions in the Strategy largely focus on areas  where the City can take independent action. to this  end we completed an early scan of suggested  adaptation actions to ascertain whether they   fell within the City’s jurisdiction/responsibility or  not. Some actions signal necessary collaboration  with the regional and provincial governments,  and it is recognized that local adaptation is  reliant on close ties and joint actions with other  levels of government, neighbours, the private  sector and community groups. Staff will continue  to collaborate on projects and push for regional  coordination on adaptation issues.   1.0  inCreaSe in intenSity anD   frequenCy of heaVy rain  eVentS  impacts: increased surface water flooding, sewer  back-ups and combined sewer overflows due to  heavy rainfall.  what this could mean: on September 19th, 2010  Vancouver’s heavy rainfall resulted in 173 filed claims  against the City and 23 other reports of flooding  related incidents from citizens. the second most  expensive national natural disaster was toronto’s  2005 downpour with damages exceeding $500  million.30 rainfall related water damage losses are  expected to continue increasing (20% by 2050  in eastern Canada) as is the volume of untreated  wastewater entering waterbodies via combined  sewer overflows (CSo). these climate change  impacts have far-reaching social, environmental  and economic implications.   oBjeCtiVe 1.1: minimiZe rainfall   relateD flooDing anD aSSoCiateD  ConSequenCeS  the City will take advantage of the following   opportunities to reduce rainfall related risks:  •  decreasing the proportion of stormwater entering   the sewer infrastructure through application of  stormwater management techniques.  •  increasing the capacity of the storm sewer  through sewer separation.  •  Accounting for climate change in system design.  1.1.1 Primary aCtion: ComPlete anD   imPlement a CitywiDe integrateD   Stormwater management Plan   Applying stormwater management techniques  where possible can reduce peak discharges and  generally reduce the flow loading on storm sewer  infrastructure, thereby increasing resilience to heavier  and more frequent storm events. Stormwater  management approaches are categorized into:  •  planning and design approaches such as limits  to impermeable surfaces;  •  runoff storage and conveyance such as using  pocket parks for street runoff, re-routing   stormwater to waterbodies, or non-potable  water storage/use; and  •  infiltration and detention practices such as green   roofs, street infiltration bulges or downspout  rock pits.  Stormwater management techniques often include   green infrastructure (bioswales, green roofs, rain   barrels) which provide a host of co-benefits with   other City goals. For example, green roofs reduce   CHApter 5 aCtionS  30 Kessler. 2011. Stormwater Strategies: Cities prepare Aging infrastructure for Climate Change.     20  energy and keep cities cooler, reducing CSos  means less pathogens enter the waterways,   and recycling stormwater contributes to water  conservation goals. the City is mandated through  the Liquid Waste Management plan to complete  an integrated Stormwater Management plan (iSMp)   for all watersheds in the City by the end of 2014.  the Citywide, cross-departmental iSMp will address   options for stormwater (rainfall) management on  both public and private property. the iSMp will  recommend changes to policy, design practices,  standards and bylaws to facilitate implementation.  1.1.2 Primary aCtion: SeParate the Sanitary  anD Stormwater SewerS (in ProgreSS)  Separating the sanitary and stormwater sewers   substantially mitigates the risk of CSos and  private property sewer back-ups. Separating the  systems also provides more capacity in the storm  sewer for handling anticipated increases in heavy  rainfall volumes.  the City is legislated to complete system separation   by 2050. Currently, high risk areas, or areas where   residents have experienced more frequent sewer  backups, are targeted for priority separation.  Separation of private side connections is not  mandated and will require a closer look to ensure  the added resilience of separated pipes is not  negated at the property line.  Supporting actions:   •  explore options for increasing replacement of  private side combined sewer connections with  separated connections in advance of City-side  separation.   •  prepare runoff control guidelines for private  property as required by Metro Vancouver in  coming years.   •  Add larger catch basins or increase number   in critical locations.  •  evaluate and recommend opportunities for  stormwater detention, infiltration or storage  during park re-design and in new parks.  •  incorporate rainfall projections and new idF  curves in sewer and street design.  •  increase public awareness of catch basin   functionality and basement flooding mitigation.   2.0 Sea leVel riSe   impacts: increased flooding, storm surge damage,   saltwater intrusion and erosion to the coastline.  impacts to gravity drainage of low lying storm  sewers and potential impacts to groundwater levels.  what this could mean: Climate change is imposing   increasing threats along coasts, both from rising  sea levels and increased intensity and frequency   of storms. Based on present and expected increases   in emissions in the near future, sea levels are   expected to rise at accelerating rates into the  next century.   A local study used assessment values to estimate  that $25 billion worth of real estate (not including  City infrastructure) is at risk from sea level rise in  Vancouver by the end of the century. industrial   lands, historic areas and the public realm are  affected disproportionately.31 the federal round  table on the environment and the economy   suggest the annual national costs of coastal  flooding damage could be as high as $8 billion  dollars in coming decades.   31 Keenan, eileen and yan, Andrew. 2011. the Local effects of global Climate Change in the City of Vancouver: A Community toolkit and Atlas.    21  oBjeCtiVe 2.1: inCreaSe the reSilienCe of VanCouVer’S   infraStruCture anD aSSetS to CoaStal flooDing   anD eroSion  Sea level rise adaptation options include protecting our coastlines with defences,   accommodating higher water levels by elevating infrastructure, avoiding  flood prone areas by focusing development elsewhere, and retreating via  land acquisition etc. Choosing among options is a complex task that starts  with a clear risk assessment detailing the magnitude and frequency of coastal   flooding, identifying vulnerabilities and quantifying potential damages and  losses. the City endeavours to find solutions that minimize the financial,   social and environmental impacts of future flooding while ensuring near-shore  amenities, access, views and other benefits are maintained. A city-wide  sea level adaptation response will provide high-level direction to navigate  through the complex issues and make civic investments without creating  undue hardships in the short term.   While the risk assessment is being completed, the City’s interim flood   construction levels need to be revised, and associated Flood-proofing policies  amended to provide certainty. policies will be revisited and updated upon  completion of the City-wide sea level rise response strategy.   2.1.1 Primary aCtion: ComPlete a CoaStal flooD riSk aSSeSSment  anD DeVeloP a City-wiDe Sea leVel riSe aDaPtation reSPonSe  Strategic planning for sea level rise is complex given the uncertainty asso- ciated with the rate of water level rise and changes in storm frequency, the  environmental and financial implications of engineering solutions, and the  long timeline for fundraising and implementing such unique capital projects.  it took 30 years for the United Kingdom and the netherlands to add new  storm protection after a disastrous coastal storm in 1953. While we are not  expecting observable impacts from sea level rise for some time, we need  to start thinking about options now. A comprehensive risk assessment is a  recognized best practice and first step toward planning actions to mitigate  the risks posed by sea level rise.  Continuing to coordinate with other municipalities regionally, with other  levels of government, and with partners such as port MetroVancouver will  be integral to maintaining the economic vibrancy of the region.   the flood risk assessment will include the following general phases of work:  • Phase 1: Flood hazard mapping/modeling  • Phase 2: Vulnerability Assessment  • Phase 3: Consequence Analysis  •  Phase 4: risk Management options/trade-off Analysis  risk assessment outputs will support development of a city-wide sea level  rise adaptation response that will address new infrastructure needs, erosion  protection considerations, land use regulation changes and plans for ameni- ties such as beaches and the seawall.     22  2.1.2 Primary aCtion: uPDate City flooD-Proofing PoliCieS   inCluDing flooD ConStruCtion leVelS  While numerous municipalities in the lower mainland maintain many kilometers  of dikes, the City of Vancouver has relied on other tools such as flood   construction levels (FCLs) and setbacks. City flood-proofing policies establish  these elevations and setbacks by flood prone area. the last amendment   to the policies in 2007 flagged the need for future updates to incorporate  new sea level rise information.   the BC Ministry of environment released new guidelines outlining incorporation   of sea level rise into FCL calculations in May, 2011. the City encouraged an   interim increase of 1m to existing FCLs while undertaking a study to apply   guideline methodology to specific coastline types. Amending the flood-proofing  policies will increase the flood resilience of new development and maintain  the potential for a range of adaptation solutions in the future. increasing the  awareness of builders and developers with respect to flood-proofing methods  and considerations will be an important complement to policy amendment.   Supporting actions:  •  Continue to coordinate with other regional municipalities and other levels  of government to ensure a regional approach to coastal flood management.   •  Leverage opportunities to evaluate strategic near-shore open space planning  for inundation and containment areas and saltwater resilient plantings.   •  initiate a flood-proofing awareness campaign among builders and developers.  •  Monitor low-lying storm sewer capacity and functionality and continue   to add back-up power and storage tanks to existing stormwater pumps.  •  Monitor groundwater for increasing levels. Consider associated impacts   in coastal development design.   3.0  inCreaSeD frequenCy anD   intenSity of StormS anD weather extremeS  impacts: increased public safety and health risks; increased resources required   to respond and recover following events.   what this could mean: in addition to earthquakes, the top hazards identified  by emergency manage-ment in 2009 are weather related events, namely  wind storms, blizzards, freezing rain/ice storms and rainstorms. the 2006  Vancouver windstorm cost the City approximately $10 million in forest resto- ration, repairs, slope stabilization and planning. Following the August 2005  rainstorm in toronto, the City spent over $40 million to bring the City’s   infrastructure back into service. Storms can be bothersome to many in terms  of service disruptions but can be lethal to vulnerable populations including  the sick, elderly, young, homeless and low-income community members.  enhancing resilience now will be cost effective in terms of damages avoided  in the long term.   Many of the actions in this chapter and the action matrix (Appendix A) help  build resilience to extreme events. the following actions focus on safety and  health risks to vulnerable populations and response and recovery capacity.   oBjeCtiVe 3.2: inCreaSe VanCouVer’S CaPaCity to reSPonD  to extreme weather eVentS anD reCoVer effeCtiVely  the City’s emergency management and response capacity will need to cater  to more frequent, simultaneous and extreme disasters. this includes dealing  with their cascading effects such as power outages and road closures. Many  existing emergency management and response practices at the City can be  expanded to cover extreme weather events. it will also be important to continue  monitoring resources including staff, their training and equipment, and City  contingency and insurance budgets to ensure they are evolving to meet new  and possibly escalating needs.   3.2.1 Primary aCtion: DeVeloP a PoliCy for BaCk-uP Power   anD aSSeSS DePartmentS for  ShortfallS  A key cascading effect of stormy weather is power outages which may in turn   cause health impacts and service/business disruption. At the peak of the 2006  windstorm, BC Hydro reported that over 250,000 customers were without power.     23  City infrastructure and facilities are often crucial during extreme event  response such as community centres providing relief, fire halls, the works  yards, traffic signals and some street lighting. other City facilities and   infrastructure may require back-up power to maintain basic services   (such as stormwater sewer pumps).   one litre of generator diesel provides about 3 to 3.5 Kilowatt hours of power.  to retain basic function in a community centre for one hour would therefore  require 30 to 50L of fuel. increased severe weather may also affect fuel   supply chains and resources that infrastructure and repair companies rely on.   identifying where investment in back-up power is integral to public safety,  storm response and recovery will build City resilience to extreme events.   A comprehensive look at backup power for public buildings and infrastructure  includes determining best methods of meeting the power needs and ensuring  fuel supply during storms.  the following steps for policy development are recommended:  •  identify and prioritize buildings and infrastructure for back-up power over  and above life safety requirements.  •  Compare the costs and benefits of mobile generators versus generators  built into facilities.  •  plan for fuel supply and emergency fuel movement from both outside  providers and city sources.   Supporting actions:  •  Continue adding back-up power to key traffic signals  •  Complete planning for response to windstorms, rainstorms and flooding.  •  Activate plans and the eoC when events are forecast or occur.   •  Consider continuity of supply of key response resources such as plywood.   •  Support the events risk Assessment task Force in ensuring events in the  City are safe and resilient to inclement weather.   •  Broaden ‘team Vancouver emergency response’ volunteer urban search  and rescue to aid with extreme event response such as park patrol during  heat waves.   oBjeCtiVe 3.1: reDuCe Safety anD health riSkS for the  homeleSS anD low-inCome PoPulation Due to inClement  weather  Added shelter capacity exists now in the form of extreme weather response  shelters that operate when specific, provincially mandated criteria are met.  these criteria and the associated funding need to be expanded to keep up  with the increase in frequency and intensity of extreme weather. the local  low-income population is generally more vulnerable to extreme weather  given their housing conditions, limited mobility, and lack of insurance and  savings. Health risks from mould and inclement weather are priorities within  this section while heat related risks are detailed in section 4 below.   Supporting actions:  •  engage with Metro Vancouver to request at the regional level that the  extreme weather shelter criteria and funding be expanded.   •  partner with VCH to initiate an education campaign on mould; how to  identify and address it.   •  ensure instances of mould are included in the new online rental database.    24  4.0 hotter, Drier SummerS   impacts: water supply shortages in late summer, increasing respiratory illness,  health and safety risks for vulnerable populations.  what this could mean: during extreme heat events, health risks from direct  impacts such as heat stroke increase, and many people with underlying health  conditions will experience a worsening of their condition. the heat wave  in 2009 in Vancouver caused an estimated 122 ‘excess deaths’ and many  emergency room visits. Vancouverites are generally less acclimatized to  high temperatures and therefore have a lower threshold for health effects.  Vulnerable populations such as older adults, infants and children, those with  chronic illness and socially disadvantaged communities are also at higher risk.   the north Shore snowpack has decreased by over 20% in the last fifty years  and is predicted to be almost non-existent by the year 2080. An increase in  annual rainfall will help offset the decrease in source water for our drinking  reservoirs but longer, drier summers may result in late summer water supply  pressure.   oBjeCtiVe 4.1: minimiZe Per CaPita water ConSumPtion  the greenest City Action plan includes a target of reducing per capita water  consumption by 33% below 2006 levels.   4.1.1 Primary aCtion: water ConSerVation (in ProgreSS)  Water conservation actions in the greenest City Action plan include water  metering and enhanced water education, incentives and conservation programs.   oBjeCtiVe 4.2: minimiZe morBiDity anD mortality During  heat waVeS  4.1.2 Primary aCtion: SuPPort the extreme hot weather   Committee in ComPletion of PhaSe ii of Planning anD exPanD  the hot weather PrePareDneSS work Program.  the City’s extreme Hot Weather Committee completed phase i of planning  in 2011, including development of a heat alert and a ‘Be Cool’ communication  campaign. the second phase of work is focused on actions to minimize   impacts of heat on health, especially within vulnerable populations. Leveraging   and adding support to the existing work program will ensure Vancouver  matches the efforts of other Canadian cities in planning for heat.   the following are some of the short and midterm actions and tasks under  the extreme hot weather preparedness work program:  •  increase resources to support an expanded program including additional  staff time from Sustainability.   •  Complete urban heat island effect mapping. Coordinate with parks on  targeting green space and trees in hot areas.  •  Work with the Coastal Communities at risk research group on vulnerable  population mapping.   •  develop policies for cool refuges and cooling capacity in civic facilities.  Assess cooling capacity of facilities within identified hot spots and prioritize  for early policy implementation.   •  research and explore options for transporting those in need to cool facilities  during heat events.     25  •  explore the potential for cooling rooms in non-market housing  •  Continue to expand public access to drinking water (gCAp).   5.0 oVerall ChangeS   impacts: Maladapted buildings; decrease in durability and lifecycle of   infrastructure; increase in impacts to urban forests, green spaces and trees;  changing pests, vectors for disease and air quality.  what this could mean: the combination of more frequent extreme events  and increases in annual temperature and precipitation will have impacts on  both the built and natural environment.   there is a significant opportunity to improve future   resilience of infrastructure by incorporating climate change information  into design today. environment Canada states that within the timeframe of  climate change impacts being felt, new building will account for an equal or  greater fraction of the building stock (assuming a 1-1.5% replacement rate).   Buildings may be maladapted to hotter temperatures, susceptible to damage  during extreme weather and encounter new durability challenges. the Urban  Heat island effect (UHie) refers to urban areas being significantly warmer than   their surrounding areas due to more heat retentive materials, surface heat   radiation being blocked by buildings and lack of evapotranspiration (through   lack of vegetation). the Urban heat island will worsen as temperatures  climb. damage to buildings from extreme weather events tends to increase  dramatically above critical threshold (e.g. 25% increase in peak wind gust  can generate 650% increase in building claims).   trees, parks and greenspaces provide innumerable co-benefits such as climate  change mitigation through carbon uptake, shade provision, moderation of  surface flooding, habitat and outdoor amenities. ensuring trees reach the size  and vigour required to start providing these benefits is essential and may be  challenged by added climate change stressors such as drought, higher peak  winds and new pests and invasive species.   oBjeCtiVe 5.1: inCreaSe reSilienCe of the Built enVironment   to future Climate ConDitionS  5.1.1 Primary aCtion: Continue to inCluDe Climate Change   aDaPtation meaSureS in the next VanCouVer BuilDing Bylaw  (VBBl) uPDate anD exPlore aSSoCiateD Zoning ChangeS.   the building bylaw includes climate related design loads based on historical  observation as well as numerous measures to ensure weather resilience in  our wet Vancouver climate. Looking ahead to heavier rain events, more wind  and hotter summers will require consideration of new building measures to  ensure continued resilience.   Buildings may be maladapted to hotter temperatures, susceptible to damage  during extreme weather and encounter new durability challenges. the Urban  Heat island effect whereby highly urbanized areas experience higher tempera- tures will exacerbate summer cooling loads. envelope integrity may also be  adversely affected by increasing wind and rain loads and higher ambient  moisture levels.  recent Canadian adaptation reports call for action by the Federal and provincial   governments in collaboration with the insurance industry to research design  practices that are cost effective and promote climate adaptation. Building  durability and disaster resilience are suggested as themes for upcoming  building code renewals. Ahead of national and provincial action, there are  several opportunities to partner on adaptation incorporation in the next VBBL.   the institute for Catastrophic Loss reduction has recently worked with ontario  builders to recommend code modifications for a changing climate and are  eager to repeat their process elsewhere. More data is required on localized  parameters related to design loads such as wind uplift pressure. the pacific  Climate impacts Consortium at the University of Victoria are eager to continue  our existing collaboration.   the following are adaptation measures to be evaluated and/or incorporated  into the building bylaw:  • Use of reflective surfaces  •  Buildings are better equipped to manage heat gain (passive guidelines)  •  development in fire interface areas (near parks and woodlands)    26  • Construction safety (high winds)  •  Continue to lobby homeowners protection office for broader acceptance  of green roofs.   •  overflow mechanisms in roof design with route plan for flood water and/ or oversize roof drainage system.  •  emergency management plans/evacuation plans for buildings;    combine flood hazard with seismic.   •  gray water use and rainwater capture for toilet flushing and garden use.  Supporting actions:  •  incorporate climate change as an asset management and infrastructure  design consideration.  •  Collaborate with Cascadia region Urban Sustainability directors network  to investigate asset management approaches to planning for climate  change.  •  Continue to collaborate with Metro Vancouver on updated intensity   duration Frequency (idF) curves.   •  identify training and implementation opportunities within engineering  with the public infrastructure engineering Vulnerability Committee   (pieVC - engineers Canada).   oBjeCtiVe 5.2: inCreaSe the long-term health anD  Vigour of urBan foreStS, green SPaCeS anD treeS  public and private trees were a focus of the access to nature goal in the  greenest city plan given the vast array of benefits they provide. growing  healthy, long lasting trees requires consideration of the future climate as   well as appropriate siting, planting and maintenance.   trees contribute to adaptation by:  •  intercepting and filtering stormwater runoff to prevent flooding and   improve water quality  •  Absorbing pollutants to clean the air  •  providing wind-breaks to protect buildings from damage  •  regulating urban heat island effects through shading and evaporation  Some co-benefits with other goals include:  •  Lower cooling demand for electricity  • directly sequester carbon  • Wildlife habitat   • increased property value and liveability  5.2.1 Primary aCtion: SuPPort DeVeloPment of a ComPrehenSiVe  urBan foreSt management Plan that foCuSeS on growing  SuCCeSSful treeS in urBan areaS.   through the greenest City Action plan we have committed to planting  150,000 trees. An Urban Forest Management plan will identify the issues  and values most important to the community and provides a roadmap for  investing in and maintaining our urban forest to 2020 and beyond. it will      27  ensure that species selected and locations for planting targeted, maximize  civic investment and ensure longevity. it will explicitly address climate  change impacts to trees and greenspaces as well as ensuring we take full  advantage of their potential to support City adaptation.   A multi-department process led by arboriculture and park professionals is  needed. the Forest Management plan should gather baseline data and provide  direction on development of standards and guidelines that address:   •  preparing for challenges facing our urban forest in the 21st century including   a changing climate.   •  increasing canopy cover citywide as a measure to help mitigate climate  change. Map canopy coverage with land use, identify tree deficient areas  and work to add tree space and appropriate soils management to remedy  the deficit.   •  Hot spot and vulnerable population mapping can be overlayed with   canopy coverage to target certain areas for shade provision.  •  organizational changes that raise the profile of trees and facilitate improved  integration of trees into urban design.   •  Minimize the negative impacts of new or existing trees.  •  Soil management: volume and make-up (loss of heritage soils).  •  educate an expert team across departments to champion trees and   provide oversight.  •  develop an Urban Forest operations program (Maintenance standards  and budgets).  Supporting actions:   •  promote public awareness of the critical role of urban forests in coping  with climate change.   •  Continue pest and invasive species monitoring programs with climate  change as an added stressor.   •  establish funding levels adequate enough to reinstitute systematic pruning.   •  ensure species and location selection criteria in the gCAp planting strategy,   landscape guidelines and in the replacement tree list in the protection of  tree Bylaw reflect future climate projections and any Urban Heat island  effect mapping.  6.0  organiZational aDaPtiVe CaPaCity   oBjeCtiVe 6.1: inCorPorate aDaPtation ConSiDerationS   in City BuSineSS  Climate change is an overarching issue that poses an additional risk or benefit   to the way we do business. Successful adaptation will require moving beyond  this strategy to incorporation of climate change in risk management and  project planning across departments.   regular updates to climate science will be shared throughout the organization  for consideration in design and planning. Mapping flood hazard, urban heat  island effect, tree canopy, landslide risk areas etc. provides a powerful baseline   of information. Seattle and toronto have both developed and applied software   programs to support mainstreaming climate change that can be evaluated  for potential use in Vancouver. Collaborating with municipalities and other  partners regionally will ensure we support regional resilience and continued  economic vibrancy.   Supporting actions:   •  Continue to collaborate regionally with First nations, Metro Vancouver  and other municipalities.  •  investigate best practices in ‘mainstreaming’ adaptation. Consider both  internal software programs and external communication/checklists.  •  Complete mapping to support climate change adaptation with co-benefits  for other applications.  •  Complete a communication strategy, including community engagement,  for Climate Change Adaptation, especially sea level rise.        28  6.1 imPlementation  ThE DEParTmENTS aND divisions identified as   accountable for actions in the Strategy will be   responsible for implementation. the Sustainability  group will provide coordination among depart- ments, deliver on specific actions and support  departments in their implementation of actions.  Where significant new actions are proposed,   the need for an implementation plan and timeline  will be evaluated.   imPlementation through exiSting  ProgramS anD Planning  the effectiveness of Strategy implementation   is dependent on incorporation of outlined   actions into existing plans, policies and programs.  Key vehicles for adaptation incorporation are   the following:  greenest City action Plan: Many of the actions  promoted for sustainability of the City have  co-benefits with climate change adaptation.   Adaptation provides either an added driver, as  with water conservation, or an added consideration  as is the case with the tree planting strategies.   integrated Stormwater management Plan:   improved management of stormwater will ensure  continued functioning of the sewer system under  heavier storm conditions. Vancouver has significant  opportunities to enhance innovative management   approaches from impervious surface policies to  street design. the integrated Stormwater Manage-  ment plan will provide cross-departmental  recommendations to take advantage of these  opportunities.   urban forest management Plan: Long living,   vigorous trees are necessary to pay back the   cost of getting them to a size at which they  start to provide significant benefits in terms of  carbon uptake, infiltration, shade provision and  water diversion. to grow successful trees in urban  areas demands proper soil management, species  selection, location and maintenance. Climate  change intensifies the need for high standards of  tree management and the incorporation of future  climate considerations.   Vancouver Building By-law update 2017: Working  with the building and academic community to  explore best methods for incorporating changing  climate loads into the building code will support  a more resilient building stock in the coming  decades.   Sewer Separation Strategy: Separating the storm   and sanitary sewers will reduce the risk of combined  sewer overflows and private side sewer back-ups.  the existing approach of prioritizing high risk areas  for early separation ensures resilience ahead of  significant shifts in storm profiles.   extreme hot weather Committee: the committee,  in partnership with Vancouver Coastal Health  developed a heat alert and Be Cool campaign   in phase i of planning. phase ii of the project can  be expanded to explore and implement many  of the best practices and programs for heat that  are being pursued by municipalities across north  America.  6.2  methoD anD SCheDule for   uPDating the Plan   our global and local understanding of climate  change and its impacts, costs and potential  actions continues to evolve. Modeled projections  continue to become increasingly sophisticated   and inputs change providing new ranges of   anticipated temperature, precipitation etc.   the City of Vancouver intends to review and   evaluate the Strategy annually and to update it  every five years from the date of initial Strategy  adoption. this cycle may be accelerated to less  than five years based on the following triggers:  •  A significant climate change impact is experi- enced; and, or  •  Senior government action or policy triggers   the need to respond (e.g. as with provincial   Sea Level rise guidelines).  CHApter 6 Plan imPlementation anD maintenanCe ProCeSS    29  annual evaluation:  Climate programs staff in the Sustainability group  will be responsible for evaluating the Strategy and  staying current with climate science.

Many of these low-regrets strategies produce  co-benefits, in that they address other City goals such as mitigation, sustainability,  human well-being etc.  robust decision making approaches: identify decisions that are robust across the  range of future possibilities, even if they are not precisely optimal for any and may   be more costly to implement.   flexible Design: Build for conditions now or for the next few decades but ensure   designs show cost effective modifications for future conditions.   flexible decision pathways: identify a wide range of options suitable for different  extents of change over timeframes. recognize that we may require an incremental  approach for pragmatic reasons (interaction with existing infrastructure) with the  opportunity to learn and re-orient as the future unfolds.   nested decisions: incremental and short term decisions will need to be embedded  within longer-term plans with key decision points or signposts identified for   reappraisal over time.  adaptive management: Adaptation efforts benefit form an iterative or adaptive   management approach due to the complexity, uncertainties and long time frame   associated with climate change.  Scenario Planning: Combinations of structured decision-making with scenario planning  for different future socio-economic and climate realities can prove useful for strategic  decision-making.  Vulnerability and risk assessments: Assessments help prioritize impacts.  risk management approaches: traditional risk management approaches from the  natural hazard field provide frameworks for action synthesis.  Challenge  uncertainty: there are various sources of uncertainty in the information we rely on  to plan for climate change including:  - the uncertainty introduced as models attempt to model natural processes  - unknown socio-economic changes that will influence our vulnerability through time.  - how future impacts will relate to each other and compound each other.   Data availability: data inputs traditionally used for planning at the municipal scale  may not be available  - gaps in knowledge at the scale of precise local impacts  - models work best with long-term trends over large areas.  timelines: decision ‘lifetimes’ interact with the nature and timing of the climate change  variable to which the decision is sensitive. For example, a new building has a short  lead-time in terms of design and permitting but long consequences meaning it will  experience a significant degree of climate change.   Choosing actions: When choosing between adaptation investments decision-makers  face a bewildering array of potential adaptation measures, each with its own costs  and benefits, often requiring phased implementation. traditional business case  templates may not apply.   33 Carmin, JoAnn, nikhil nadkarni, and Christopher rhie. 2012. progress and Challenges in Urban Climate Adaptation planning: results of a global Survey. Cambridge, MA: Mit.  A recent global survey on urban adaptation challenges found the following trend.  “in general, cities throughout the world report that they are having difficulty obtaining financial resources, allocating staff time, communicating the nature   of the program, generating interest among political officials and business, mainstreaming, and gaining the commitment of local elected officials and government  departments. two additional global trends are that most cities believe their national governments have limited understanding of the challenges they are facing,  and most have limited access to financial support from local, regional, national, and international sources.” 33    54  AppendiX e POTENTial aDaPTaTiON iNDiCaTOrS  oBjeCtiVe 1.1: minimiZe rainfall relateD flooDing anD  aSSoCiateD ConSequenCeS.
