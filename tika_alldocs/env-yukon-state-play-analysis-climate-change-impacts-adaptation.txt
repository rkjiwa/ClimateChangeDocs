This work will also explore the economic challenges and   opportunities related to adaptation.   This is not a comprehensive analysis of all the issues around climate change and adaptation   efforts. It is a synthesis of existing knowledge and provides a focused snapshot of selected key   adaptation challenges in the Yukon.   The strongest measure of climate change in Yukon is relative change in annual temperature. The   annual average temperature has increased 2°C over the past 50 years, while winter   temperatures have increased 4°C.   Annual precipitation (rain and snowfall), another important indicator of climate change, has   increased by 6% in the Yukon over the past 50 years, with the greatest increase seen during the   summer months.   Temperature is projected to increase by more than 2°C over the next 50 years. Winters are   projected to warm faster than any other season. Precipitation is projected to increase by 10% to   20% over the next 50 years in Yukon. Snowfall is projected to arrive later in the fall and become   more variable over the winter, with periods of little snow and intense snow-fall events likely   becoming more common.   Adaptation to climate change starts when governments, communities, and individuals adjust   their expectations about the future and make decisions to better prepare for changing   conditions. Yukon has already started to adapt to the effects of climate change and decision   makers have an interest in addressing present and future climate change impacts through   adaptation.   Growing concern for Yukon’s changing climate has led to increased research and adaptation   initiatives that contribute to the development of new knowledge and local capacity and   expertise. Ensuring that the climate change funding and programming opportunities   substantively enhance the adaptive capacity of communities is critical to Yukon’s long-term   adaptation efforts.

INTRODUCTION   This report was commissioned by Environment Yukon’s Climate Change Secretariat to provide  the public and other stakeholders with an understanding of how climate change is affecting  Yukon, what actions have been taken to date to help us adapt, and the key challenges that we’ll  need to address to adapt in the future. This work will also explore the economic challenges and  opportunities related to adaptation.   This is not a comprehensive documentation of all the issues around climate change and  adaptation efforts. It is a synthesis of existing knowledge and provides a focused snapshot on  selected key adaptation challenges in the Yukon.     1.1 CONTEXT   Climate change is already affecting Yukon and consideration of climate is becoming increasingly  important in decision making and planning for the future. The Yukon Climate Change Impacts  and Adaptation ‘State of Play’ report was developed to provide Yukoners with the latest  information about climate change impacts and adaptation in Yukon. Included in the analysis are  the economic impacts of climate change. The report is designed to support public participation  in decision making about climate change issues that affect Yukon communities by providing a  snapshot of climate change impacts and adaptation efforts to date.   Canada, along with most other countries, has begun taking more aggressive action on climate  change. The recently adopted Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change  (2016) commits to action in the areas of climate change mitigation, adaptation, carbon pricing,  and clean economic growth.    The Yukon government has committed to renewing its climate change strategy in a manner that  better integrates its approaches to energy, climate change risk and action, and clean  growth/economic development. Throughout this process, Yukon government aims to engage  with the public to solicit feedback on the renewal of this strategy.    The effects of climate change pull on environmental, social, and economic threads, not all of  which are directly related to the changing climate, but are still important to consider when  planning for effective adaptation actions. These include environmental changes caused by  drivers other than climate change, as well as demography, culture and economic development.  Indeed, “climate change has compounded some of the existing vulnerabilities caused by these  other factors” (Larsen et al., 2014).    Adaptation to climate change starts when governments, communities, and individuals adjust  their expectations about the future and make decisions to better prepare for changing  conditions. Yukon has already started to adapt to the effects of climate change and decision  makers have taken steps to address present and future climate change impacts through  adaptation policies and initiatives. Despite this, efforts to integrate climate change  considerations into decisions and implement effective adaptive actions face significant  challenges.     Yukon ‘State of Play’:   Analysis of Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation November 14, 2017         RESEARCH NORTHWEST & MORRISON HERSHFIELD 2      Our ability to adapt to climate change will have an  important influence on what Yukon’s future will  look like. If we are proactive in our approach to  adaptation many issues can be avoided and some  impacts lessened. However, some impacts will be  much more difficult to adapt to.   Building momentum for climate change adaptation  will take time and concerted effort. Developing  expertise and allocating adequate financial  resources to adaptation initiatives and planning is  critical. This report was developed in part to help  support collaborative opportunities for climate  change adaptation where connections are not  always clear and simple.   1.2 APPROACH   Our approach to this report has been to:    Provide a synthesis of the most up to date information available on climate change impacts  and adaptation in Yukon (Section 2);    Select and present concrete examples of some of the Yukon-specific work being done to  better understand the effects of local climate change (Section 2.3);    Provide an overview of our assessment of the Yukon’s capacity to adapt to climate change  (Section 3) along with a list of known adaptation initiatives undertaken in the territory  (APPENDIX B); and,    Examine in more detail four issues that are particularly important as the Yukon continues to  adapt to the realities of climate change:   o Increased risk of extreme weather and wildfire hazards (Section 4);   o Damage to infrastructure (Section 5);   o Changing ecological landscapes (Section 6); and,   o Concerns regarding human health (Section 7).   The four major issues grew from our review of the relevant literature and discussions with key  contacts. For each of the four issues listed above, we summarize how climate change and  current adaptation efforts intersect with the issue now and how we expect those intersections  to change.    We have attempted to identify further opportunities for adaptation, economic costs and  possible economic benefits. These opportunities are not intended to be exhaustive or definitive,  but to provide a starting point for a renewed conversation about how Yukon can address  current and future climate change impacts.       What is Climate Change Adaptation?   Climate change adaptation refers to   actions that reduce the negative   impact of climate change and/or take   advantage of new opportunities. It   involves making adjustments in our   decisions, activities and thinking   because of observed or expected   changes in climate.   (Lemmen, Warren, Lacroix, and Bush,   2008).     Yukon ‘State of Play’:   Analysis of Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation November 14, 2017         RESEARCH NORTHWEST & MORRISON HERSHFIELD 3      Our focus on further opportunities for adaptation has been guided by four questions:    Are the risks of not taking further adaptation action significant?    Are there possible economic benefits from the adaptation action itself?    Will Yukon regret doing this if the climate threat does not materialize?     Is this action a win for Yukon communities even if the climate threat turns out to not be a  severe as some scenarios projected?   We have also attempted to explicitly highlight where the suggested adaptation opportunities  might intersect with other issues and opportunities in Yukon (e.g. Fire Smart and biomass heat).  Adaptation opportunities and efforts are rarely stand-alone issues.

YUKON’S CHANGING CLIMATE   Climate change is a complex problem that impacts  natural, human, and cultural systems in many  ways. In Yukon, changes to the climate have  already been observed and impact our water,  ecosystems, landscapes, and ways of life. How  climate change is understood and talked about in  Yukon is grounded in scientific evidence, the  Traditional Knowledge of Yukon First Nations, and  the observations of Yukoners.    Changes are expected to continue and increase in  the decades ahead. The amount of change and  associated impacts will ultimately depend on the  success of global efforts to curb emissions of  greenhouse gasses (i.e. mitigate climate change)  and our ability to adapt to climate change    Temperature and precipitation are well understood  and widely used indicators of climate change that  drive a broad range of climate impacts. The Yukon  generally has only about 50 years of temperature  and precipitation data, not a significant record  given that a climate normal is usually defined over a 30-year period. This lack of long-term data  makes additional proxy data drawn from historical, local, and indigenous sources of knowledge  particularly valuable in improving our understanding how climate change is affecting the Yukon.   This section summarizes analyses  of temperature and precipitation  data to show how Yukon’s  climate has changed and how it  is expected to change in the  future. Projections for  temperature and precipitation  change in Old Crow and  Whitehorse are also highlighted  as local examples of the type of  change Yukoners can expect to  see in their communities.    As climate change impacts  Yukon’s regions in different  ways, this section also includes  discussion of how Yukoners are  observing the impacts of climate  change in their own communities   Gradual and Sudden   Although temperature and   precipitation seem to be changing   slowly, the interaction between   “gradual” changes and other factors   can produce complex and sudden   effects. For example, warmer annual   temperatures associated with   climate change have accelerated the   retreat of the Kaskawulsh glacier,   which led to a sudden diversion of   water from the Slims River to the   Alsek River in 2016. This resulted in   a substantial drop in water levels in   the Slims River and in Kluane Lake,   which impacts the communities of   Burwash Landing and Destruction   Bay.       Variability Within Long-Term Trends   Long-term climate trends are important, but these   broader changes are driven in part by short-term   weather variability. Extreme swings in temperature and   precipitation can have serious impacts on everything   from infrastructure to wildlife breeding cycles, but   increases in the severity, frequency or duration of   extreme events are not easily captured in long-term   trends. For example, a one degree increase in average   annual temperature can mean 25 days where   temperatures are 15 degrees above the seasonal   normal if climate remains at normal levels the rest of   the year. This example shows how averaging change in   temperature throughout the year can hide the extent of   extreme temperature variability.     Yukon ‘State of Play’:   Analysis of Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation November 14, 2017         RESEARCH NORTHWEST & MORRISON HERSHFIELD 5      and in culturally and ecologically important places. These and other related changes present a  wide range of challenges and opportunities for future adaptation efforts in Yukon.    2.1 HISTORICAL CHANGES IN TEMPERATURE AND PRECIPITATION   The strongest measure of climate change in Yukon is relative change in annual temperature. The  annual average temperature has increased 2°C over the past 50 years, while winter  temperatures have increased 4°C. These temperatures are understood to be increasing at twice  the rate of southern Canada and the global average. This rise in temperature means that winters  are getting shorter and spring and fall are getting relatively longer. There are significantly fewer  very cold days in the winter but no significant change in the number of very hot days (above  30oC) in the summer. (Furgal and Prowse, 2008; Larsen et al., 2015).    Warmer average temperatures are associated with a wide variety of impacts on Yukon  communities and landscapes. For example, more rapid permafrost thaw is resulting in an  increase in impacts on community infrastructure built on permafrost areas. Warmer  temperatures have also resulted in widespread melting of glaciers and the rate of melt  continues to increase. Yukon has lost 22% of its glacial cover over the last 50 years (Derksen et  al. 2012).    Annual precipitation (rain and snowfall), another  important indicator of climate change, has increased  by 6% in the Yukon over the past 50 years, with the  greatest increase seen during the summer months  (Streicker, 2016). Changes in precipitation cause  changes in surface and ground water, permafrost,  vegetation and wildlife. Yukoners have experienced  higher summer precipitation and more extreme rain  events, associated flood events, permafrost thaw  (more snow cover traps heat in the ground), and  river bank erosion. The trend points towards a  further increase in annual precipitation and possibly  more extreme variability in precipitation as well.   Yukoners have observed an increase in short-term  extremes in temperature and precipitation and data  suggests that variability is increasing in Yukon.  Projected future changes in temperature and  precipitation suggest that short-term extremes will  happen more often (Streicker, 2016).    Figure 1 shows how winter temperatures in  2015/2016 departed from the 1961-1990 average across Canada. The biggest departure from  average occurred in the central Yukon.   El Nino   During “El Nino” years, periodic   warming of the Pacific Ocean drives   warmer and more extreme weather   patterns across North America. In   2015-16 El Nino contributed to   Yukon winter temperatures that   were almost 70C above seasonal   averages (Environment Canada,   2017). Typically, El Nino years have   been observed 5 out of every 100   years, but new research suggests   that global climate warming is likely   to increase the number of El Nino   events to 10 in every 100 years   under current emission scenarios   (Guojian, et al., 2017).       Yukon ‘State of Play’:   Analysis of Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation November 14, 2017         RESEARCH NORTHWEST & MORRISON HERSHFIELD 6      Figure 1: Temperature Departures from the 1960-91 Average — Winter 2015/2016       (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2017)   2.2 EXPECTED FUTURE CHANGES IN TEMPERATURE AND PRECIPITATION    The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has developed three scenarios for future  temperature changes for Polar Regions. All scenarios show both an increase in temperature and  its variability. Temperature is projected to increase by more than 2°C over the next 50 years in  Yukon (Streicker, 2016). Winters are projected to warm faster than any other season (IPCC,  2014).     Precipitation is projected to increase by 10% to 20% over the next 50 years in Yukon. All  scenarios project a significant increase in precipitation. In practical terms, this means that  precipitation is expected to become more variable and increase in summer months. Snow fall is  projected to come later in the fall, become more variable with periods of little snow, and it is  likely that intense snow-fall events will be more common (Streicker, 2016).   These expected continuing changes in temperature and precipitation matter to Yukoners as they  will need to cope with, and adapt to changes in local environments, impacts on community  infrastructure built on permafrost areas, more extreme rain events and associated floods.    For more detail on how Yukon’s climate has changed and how it is expected to change in the  future see APPENDIX A at the end of this report.        Yukon ‘State of Play’:   Analysis of Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation November 14, 2017         RESEARCH NORTHWEST & MORRISON HERSHFIELD 7      2.2.1 Community-Level Climate Change Projections   The Scenarios Network for Alaska and Arctic Planning (SNAP) has developed a climate model  that projects temperatures and precipitation patterns for approximately 80 locations in the  Yukon. These projections give a sense of how, at a broad level, climate is expected to change at  those locations. SNAP releases these projections with the qualifier that there is inherent  uncertainty in projecting future climate change, but that the value of developing and using the  projections in community adaptation planning “allows for greater flexibility in the face of high  uncertainty” (SNAP 2017). One weakness in the SNAP model is that it does not take temperature  inversions (i.e. significant temperature differences between lower altitude and higher altitude  areas) into account, an important issue in many Yukon communities.    We have selected Whitehorse and Old Crow as examples to illustrate what the SNAP model  provides. See APPENDIX A. Some selected highlights of the SNAP projections for Old Crow and  Whitehorse are:    Winter temperatures are projected to increase significantly for both Old Crow and  Whitehorse;    Both Old Crow and Whitehorse are projected to have much warmer spring (May and June)  temperatures with little extra rainfall in those months;    Overall precipitation is projected to increase steadily in Old Crow; and    An overall increase in precipitation for Whitehorse but with more variability than Old Crow.   In general, the same changes are projected for both Whitehorse and Old Crow with notably  warmer temperatures and more precipitation expected in the coming decades. At a practical  level, these trends likely lead to different kinds of anticipated changes in both communities such  as:     A longer growing season that will allow more local agriculture and therefore more local food  supply;    Increased fire risk early in the fire season which will have the effect of extending the fire  season and its associated risks and costs;    A reduced period during which ice and frozen ground can be used for travel or food storage  which may reduce traditional activities; and    A shift in precipitation from snow to rain, which impacts water storage capacity and surface  water availability.   2.3 COMMUNITY-LEVEL OBSERVATIONS OF CLIMATE CHANGE   Yukoners have observed and experienced the impacts of climate change in their communities.  Indigenous elders speak to changes on the land, communities, and traditional practices  originating from changes in climate.    Sections 2.3.1 through 2.3.3 highlight three examples from of local climate change impacts that  have been observed at the community-level. These examples help to illustrate how our changing  climate is affecting people in different areas of Yukon, and helps us better understand potential     Yukon ‘State of Play’:   Analysis of Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation November 14, 2017         RESEARCH NORTHWEST & MORRISON HERSHFIELD 8      impacts that we may see in the future. They are also strong reminders of the need for improving  local climate monitoring and data collection, and partnerships that will sustain these efforts, to  better understand and adapt to climate change impacts that affect Yukon communities.    2.3.1 Yukon First Nation Elders see Climate Change Impacts to Water, Wildlife and  Traditional Foods   Yukon First Nations elders and  other community members have  concerns about the changes that  are taking place on their lands  that affect their way of life.  Elders have documented many  changes on the land and in their  communities and are concerned  about the future.   Elders highlighted the following  changes in forums held in 2003- 2004 in Yukon First Nation  Communities (Huntington, Fox,  and Dickson, 2005):      In northern Yukon, freezing  rains in the early winter have  created a layer of ice that  limit the ability of some  animals to access food  sources.     The bush and the forest are changing and shrubs are getting larger, and more abundant in  areas where they were not typically seen before.    Birds that usually migrate south in August and September are now being seen in October  and November.     In some areas, thawing permafrost has caused the ground to drop or has made the area  smell foul.    In more southerly communities, rings around the moon are no longer seen, although they  are still visible in the northernmost community.  Similar changes to the visual character of  the atmosphere have been observed by Inuit Elders who observed changes in the location of  the sunset on the horizon (Kunuk and Mauro, 2015). These observations indicate higher  levels of moisture in the air linked to increases in temperatures.     There are more frequent sightings of cougars, and mule deer, and new types of insects.    People used to be able to predict when it would get colder by looking at tree leaves. It has  become more difficult to do that now.   Indigenous Knowledge   Indigenous knowledge and observations are important   to understanding climate change in Yukon. This   knowledge indicates that important changes have   already occurred. “In the Yukon community members   are reporting changes including: unpredictable weather,   glaciers and permafrost are melting, wildlife migration   patterns, new species, insect populations, increasing   forest fires and different water levels.” (Champagne and   Aishihik First Nations and Alsek Renewable Resources   Council, 2009).    At another Yukon workshop elders described similar   experiences with the weather becoming unpredictable,   expressing growing concern about impacts of climate   change on wildlife, land, and water (Dickson, in   Henderson and Fox 2005 p. 77).        Yukon ‘State of Play’:   Analysis of Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation November 14, 2017         RESEARCH NORTHWEST & MORRISON HERSHFIELD 9       Lakes and streams are drying up or becoming choked with weeds, making the water  undrinkable.    Many animals are changing where they go and their behavior. Bears used to go into their  dens in October and November, but are now out until December.     There is a growing dependence on market foods and people eat fewer traditional foods.    These are just a few examples of the type of climate change impacts that are causing alarm for  many Yukon First Nation elders. Importantly, elders emphasize the need for each community to  have the ability to prepare for change and to be a part of designing the strategies that are being  developed to respond to climate change impacts.    Initiatives like the ongoing adaptation planning efforts of the Champagne Aishihik First Nation  (CAFN) and the Selkirk First Nation (SFN) are examples of this work in action. These initiatives  have sought to engage directly with community members to understand environmental changes  that First Nations citizens are seeing on their traditional territories, and develop new ideas and  approaches to preserving traditional practices in the face of climate change.   2.3.2 Ice Breakup on Yukon River in Dawson City    Long-term community level impact information like the breakup data discussed here is valuable  for measuring change, understanding the rate of change over time, and can help inform  planning for the future. The trend from the past 120 years of breakup data is strong evidence  that that fast ice cover on the Yukon River – the ice that extends into water from shore – will  continue to diminish in Dawson. Although still an uncommon occurrence, in the winter of 2016- 2017 an official ice road was not possible because of poor ice conditions. Long-term data on the  ice break up is an indicator that can help inform adaptation measures like extending the ferry  season, and planning for shorter ice road seasons.   The exact timing of the ice breakup on the Yukon River in Dawson has been recorded every year  since 1886. The practice that originated from a lively betting tradition now provides a long-term  indication of how changes in climate are impacting the breakup. Figure 2 shows the timing of  the ice breakup over the past 120 years. The trend line shows the spring breakup occurring on  average 6 days earlier per century.     Yukon ‘State of Play’:   Analysis of Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation November 14, 2017         RESEARCH NORTHWEST & MORRISON HERSHFIELD 10      Figure 2: Timing of the Ice Breakup on the Yukon River in Dawson City      (Environment Yukon, 2017)   Earlier breakup means that the ice road across the Yukon River that connects the town of  Dawson with West Dawson will experience shorter seasons, limiting access to food, medical  care, and work and recreation opportunities for West Dawson residents. All West Dawson  residents plan for the shoulder season when there is no access to town, however, when the  season extends longer than anticipated residents may be faced with shortages in food or other  essential goods that occasionally require expensive helicopter re-supplies. Furthermore, not  captured in the ice break-up data is that warmer and more variable temperatures increase the  risk of mid-winter and spring flooding. In 2009, ice jamming and unusual patterns of river ice  break-up triggered significant damage to infrastructure in Dawson City.   2.3.3 Changes in Vegetation and New Bird Species on Qikiqtaruk-Hershel Island    Documented changes in vegetation and the observation of new bird species on Qikiqtaruk- Herschel Island serve as an example of how climate change is affecting Yukon’s most northern  region.   A seventeen-year study of the vegetation communities on Qikiqtaruk-Herschel Island  documented rapid changes to the island’s vegetation ecology (Myers-Smith et al. 2017). Shrubs  and grasses are growing higher and expanding into areas that were typically bare or had  minimal vegetation. The changes were linked to warming air temperatures along with longer  growing seasons and increasing permafrost thaw.    Recent bird surveys conducted on Qikiqtaruk found several migratory bird species that are  normally only found in areas a thousand kilometers further south. The most striking example of  this was the discovery of a Calliope Hummingbird in the summer of 2017 (see Photo 2).      Yukon ‘State of Play’:   Analysis of Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation November 14, 2017         RESEARCH NORTHWEST & MORRISON HERSHFIELD 11      These observations indicate how changes in climate are changing local ecology and landscapes  across Yukon. This has far reaching consequences for wildlife and vegetation that are still not  fully understood. While we know that some birds and shrub are changing in response to shifting  temperatures, plant or animal species that cannot adapt or move to more favourable areas fast  enough may experience stress and other negative impacts.

YUKON’S CAPACITY TO ADAPT   Yukon’s climate change adaptation landscape involves a diverse group of governments and non- governmental organizations with a wide range of jurisdictional responsibilities, resources, and  areas of interest and expertise. While the variety of actors involved makes it difficult to  assemble a comprehensive picture of Yukon’s adaptation capacity, analyzing some of the  adaptation projects or initiatives that have been undertaken by these groups provides us with a  snapshot.   3.1 YUKON ADAPTATION EFFORTS TO DATE   Over $13 million has been invested since 2008 in the 80 adaptation projects identified in this  analysis, most of which (85%) was provided through federal government agencies and  programs. More than two-thirds of these projects were partnerships between two or more  organizations, with most implemented by First Nations or territorial government agencies –  often in partnership with other non-profit, indigenous, or academic organizations – and funded  by the federal government.    Two notable federal adaptation programs that have served as drivers of territorial efforts to  date to address climate change impacts are:    Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada’s Climate Change Preparedness in the North   program (formerly Climate Change Adaptation Program) supports identification and   assessment of climate-related risks, adaptation research and planning, and efforts to   address major climate change issues such as related to infrastructure, extreme weather   events, and permafrost degradation. This analysis has identified 35 projects financed   through the two funding streams of the program (for First Nations communities and   territorial government departments, respectively).        Health Canada’s Climate Change Health Adaptation Program has emphasized a community-  focused approach; projects address climate change-related needs identified by the   community, strengthen a community’s adaptive capacity, and involve community members   in the project’s results. This analysis identified 23 Yukon projects funded through this   program, many of which focused on food security and Traditional Knowledge transfer   between elders and youth.   The focus of most of these projects has been determined by the capacity and specific interests   of proponents, and the criteria set out by funding agencies. These criteria, designed to be   enabling rather than proscriptive, have provided significant flexibility for proponents to address   climate change impacts of interest to their organizations or communities. While this flexible,   project-based approach has helped to realize adaptation actions that might not otherwise occur,   it is also more piece-meal than strategic, and does not easily lend itself to a more coherent   effort to develop capacity or expertise in areas where they are most needed, or where they can   have the biggest impact.    A summary of adaptation projects identified for this analysis can be found in APPENDIX B.

Building on this work,  and re-focusing efforts towards the targeted development of capacity and resources will be an  important component of building resilience to climate change across sectors and communities.  There are, however, certain challenges that will need to be addressed along the way.    Most of these challenges relate to the multi-faceted nature of climate change (i.e., its  complexity and uncertainty) and difficulties related to governance (i.e., difficulty of  implementing adaptation due to limited annual budgets and competing priorities). The sense of  urgency to address challenges that limit Yukon’s capacity to adapt is growing as impacts of  climate change, and related issues of community development and sustainability, increase.  Other specific issues that limit Yukon’s ability to adapt to climate change include:    Climate change is complex and cannot be fully understood or dealt with by one organization  or government – especially in Yukon, which has eleven self-governing First Nations in  addition to federal, territorial and municipal agencies with overlapping jurisdictions and  interests.     Government departments and policy-makers sometimes struggle to prioritize long-term  planning objectives related to climate change adaptation when faced with immediate needs  and financial constraints. Furthermore, it is often difficult for many decision-makers to see  tangible connections between the issues they are mandated to address and the interaction  of these issues with climate change.    A challenge in the Yukon, as in the rest of Canada, is that there has been little effort to  actively support climate change adaptation through changes to existing legislation or  regulations. In part, this appears to stem from a general reluctance to open legislation for  changes and from a lack of clarity or consensus on what changes should be made.      Difficulties in integrating adaptation into long-term planning are compounded by limited  local-level information or projections about climate change impacts, which serves to  increase uncertainty about what actions should be taken to address climate change impacts  at a local scale.     Financial management and administration systems are sometimes designed in ways that do  not adequately consider the long-term financial costs of climate change in present-day  spending and procurement decisions (e.g., new buildings are not required to take into  consideration possible impacts of climate change).    Slow progress on mitigating climate change (i.e., reducing GHG emissions) in Yukon risks  slowing adaption as well. Successful climate change mitigation measures, particularly in the  areas of infrastructure and buildings, will help adaptation and vis-versa (see Figure 3).               Yukon ‘State of Play’:   Analysis of Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation November 14, 2017         RESEARCH NORTHWEST & MORRISON HERSHFIELD 14      Figure 3: Green Resilience: Adaptation and Mitigation Synergies      (Centre for Clean Air Policy, 2016)         As impacts of climate change become more apparent, the adaptive capacity of many   communities may be challenged or exceeded but the severity of these impacts, reducing their   ability to adapt. “Extreme impacts can exceed human and financial resources to address them,   and can cause physical, financial and psychological stress. Stress on local governments and   service providers, and other responders to disasters, can reduce adaptive capacity to address   climate change impacts in both the short and long terms” (Manuel et al., 2012 in Lemmen, D.S.,   et. al. 2016 p. 118). Building partnerships and relationships with communities so that they can   address key vulnerabilities over the long-term will help address this challenge.      No Regrets   The broader benefits of acting to adapt to climate risks is the low/no regrets model where   decisions or actions related to climate change make sense in development terms regardless   if a specific climate threat materializes in the future. This is achieved by building resilience to   changing economic, social and environmental conditions (Adapted from Siegel, 2011). This   approach is useful when considering how to plan and prioritize adaptation measures. One   can ask: will we regret doing this if the climate threat does not materialize? Is this action   good for Yukon communities even if the climate threat turns out to not be as severe as   some scenarios project?        Yukon ‘State of Play’:   Analysis of Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation November 14, 2017         RESEARCH NORTHWEST & MORRISON HERSHFIELD 15      Although progress has been made in this area, climate change adaptation still is not  systematically considered in most government policy decisions. This makes Yukon more  vulnerable to climate change impacts, as present-day solutions are developed without adequate  understanding of how the problems being addressed may be affected by climate change over  the long term.

EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS AND WILDFIRE   4.1 EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS   The variability of our climate is expected to increase. This will mean more extreme weather  events and greater fluctuations in precipitation, which are associated with increases in  landslides and flooding. Flooding can negatively affect communities in a range of ways, including  population displacement, impacts on critical infrastructure, interruptions to business activities,  decreased production due to worker displacement, impacts on physical health, and impacts on  mental health, including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (Henstra, D. and  Thistlethwaite, J., 2017).   Some of the direct and  indirect costs that result  from extreme rainfall  events are exemplified by  the flash floods that  simultaneously washed  out the Alaska Highway at  Rancheria and at the  south end of Kluane Lake  in 2012.   The highway was closed  for a total of four days at  Rancheria and two days at  Kluane Lake. During this  period, the costs that  resulted from these  closures included:    Both the emergency  road repairs and the permanent repairs;    The business costs to trucking companies as hundreds of trucks sat idle for days and trucking  schedules were disrupted;    The time costs to travellers, both locals and tourists, whose plans were disrupted and  delayed;    The costs to businesses who ran out of goods (particularly at grocery stores, where shelves  sat empty), and to others whose workers were unavailable due to the travel disruption;    The costs of delays in mail and parcel delivery services; and    The knock-on losses to tourism businesses as people changed their plans in response.     Alaska Highway Closed   “The Alaska Highway reopened Monday evening near   Rancheria following the completion of a road detour around   the substantial washout at Canyon Creek. Northbound   commercial trucks stranded at the highway lodge since the   washout occurred last Thursday night were the first to be   taken over the single-lane detour… Once Rancheria was   cleared, some 200 commercial trucks waiting in Watson Lake   to come north were released… Larger industrial vehicles   followed. Then private vehicles and RVs were released in   groups behind a pilot car. Southbound traffic backed up in   Teslin was released at about the same time as vehicles waiting   in Watson Lake to come north.”    (Whitehorse Star, June 12, 2012).     Yukon ‘State of Play’:   Analysis of Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation November 14, 2017         RESEARCH NORTHWEST & MORRISON HERSHFIELD 17      4.1.1 Adaptation to Flood Hazards   In Canada, flooding has surpassed theft and burglary as the largest single source of property  insurance claims (Henstra, D. and Thistlethwaite, J., 2017). Mitigating flood hazard risk requires  that we improve knowledge and awareness of what values (e.g. personal or commercial  property, public infrastructure, industrial infrastructure, sites for traditional activities, etc.) are  exposed to these risks, and what arrangements are currently in place to reduce vulnerability to  flooding.  In 2016, Yukon government collected digital elevation data in 13 communities to  identify what areas might be exposed to flooding at different water levels. This data is currently  available online and is being used to create flood risk maps for use by residents, decision-makers  and land-use planners.      Photo 4: Flooding at Army Beach      (Environment Yukon, 2007)        Yukon ‘State of Play’:   Analysis of Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation November 14, 2017         RESEARCH NORTHWEST & MORRISON HERSHFIELD 18      Other adaptations to climate change-driven increases in flood hazards in Yukon, both flash  flooding and other higher water levels, are currently being advanced through ongoing efforts to  reduce flood risks and damage, including:    Better land planning and zoning to account for flood risks;    Flood control infrastructure in already developed areas subject to floods;    Re-assessment of eligibility of property owners for compensation in areas subject to  repeated flooding;    Improved road infrastructure standards, including elevation and culvert size requirements;  and    Updated storm sewer standards.   4.2 WILDFIRE    Wildfire in Yukon forests is an existing hazard to Yukon communities and infrastructure that can  have environmental and economic consequences. Most Yukoners live in the boreal forest,  where fire is an integral part of the ecology: “fires are frequent and their ecological influence at  all levels—species, stand and landscape—drives boreal forest vegetation dynamics” (NRCan,  2017). In addition, many areas near communities, residences, and other infrastructure have  accumulated deadfall and forest debris. The Yukon has seen many large wildfires (e.g., in 1958)  and will see them again.   There are many factors — forest age, past fire suppression, lack of fuel management, insect   infestations, drought, and trees blown down by storms — influencing the likelihood of wildfires.  “Quantifying the multiple effects of climate change will be challenging, particularly because  there are great uncertainties attached to possible interactions among them, as well as with  other land-use pressures” (Price et.al., 2013). However, it appears that climate change is likely  increasing both the likelihood and potential severity of wildfire hazards in Yukon:     Analysis of historical wildfire data examining annual area burned does not reveal a  statistically significant increase in fire risks in Yukon, but a trend is apparent when looking  more broadly at regional data from Alaska and the Northwest Territories that indicates an  increased wildfire risk is expected (Streicker, 2016);   Whitehorse Saved by Rain   “Rain saved Whitehorse last week. If it hadn't come, forestry officials say there would have   been little hope for the town with a 30-mile front of fire advancing. In some places 20 miles   away, the fire came up within five miles of the White Pass tank farm and was seen plainly   from city streets Friday evening… Nobody outside was more worried than local inhabitants   who were told by Mayor Gordon Cameron to prepare for emergency evacuation. It was   decided… that in event of the fire getting too close, local residents would be sent to   Carcross either in their own cars or by special White Pass trains.”   (Whitehorse Star, July 24, 1958).        Yukon ‘State of Play’:   Analysis of Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation November 14, 2017         RESEARCH NORTHWEST & MORRISON HERSHFIELD 19       Natural Resources Canada states that climate change during the 21st century is expected to  result in more frequent large fires in many boreal forests: “Large wildfires, which can cause  serious economic losses, are expected to become more frequent, but increases in mean  annual area burned will be relatively gradual.” (Price et. al., 2013);    Climate change impacts that could add damaged or dead wood to the forest fuel load (for  example, from insect outbreaks, ice storms or high winds) may increase the risk of fire; and    Recent major wildfires in Fort McMurray (2016) and Interior British Columbia (2017) are  important reminders of our limited ability to supress intense wildfires and avoid major  losses of homes, businesses, and community infrastructure.   The mechanism by which climate change can be expected to result in increased wildfire risk  includes greater risk of dry winters and dry summers (through increased precipitation variability  despite average precipitation increasing) and through increased heat and desiccation of existing  fuel sources. There may also be trends in convective storms leading to more lightning strikes.   4.3 ADAPTATION TO WILDFIRE HAZARDS   In practical terms, the primary means of adapting to the increased likelihood and potential  severity of wildfires in Yukon largely overlap with existing efforts to reduce risks, including:    More robust emergency preparedness and public infrastructure (including communication  systems along with road access to vulnerable areas) will limit a broad range of risks and  improve overall public safety;    Evacuation and emergency response plans, both at the household and community level. The  Yukon Emergency Measures Organization is responsible for coordinating community-level  plans, but it is up to individuals to both be aware of these plans and to create their own  household plans;     Land use planning that accounts for increased wildfire risks when planning new  developments. One suggestion in the Whitehorse Community Adaptation Plan is to  strategically place agricultural land developments as fire-breaks to reduce wildfire risk;     Encourage the increased use of fire-resistant building materials, including metal cladding,  metal roofs and metal soffits, along with closing in areas under decks and porches, to  provide better protection from wind-driven embers. Yukon Community Services already  provides this advice to Yukoners, however, a more concerted public education campaign  and incentive program, or possibly changes to building code requirements for rural- residential lots, could further reduce risks;    Encourage fuel reduction (deadfall removal, tree thinning, replacement of conifer trees such  as spruce with more fire-resistant birch or aspen) on private property. Yukon Community  Services already provides this advice to Yukoners; however, a more concerted public  education campaign and incentive program could reduce risks; and    Systematic identification and prioritization of fuel rich areas for targeted fuel reduction on  public land near communities.        Yukon ‘State of Play’:   Analysis of Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation November 14, 2017         RESEARCH NORTHWEST & MORRISON HERSHFIELD 20      Photo 5: Yukon Wildfire         (Yukon Government Protective Services)   4.3.1 Adaption Opportunity: FireSmart Plus   Most Yukoners are familiar with the FireSmart program. FireSmart has an annual budget of  $850,000, and has spent approximately $15 million since 1999 on efforts to thin trees and  reduce fuel loads around most Yukon communities. The program’s primary aim is to reduce fire  risks, but it is also a local economic development tool that provides seasonal employment.    There are several issues, however, currently limiting the capacity of the FireSmart program to  effectively reduce wildfire risk to communities:    The program’s relatively modest funding is spread throughout the Yukon and is not  systematically focused on priority areas where wildfire risk is most significant;     Yukon ‘State of Play’:   Analysis of Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation November 14, 2017         RESEARCH NORTHWEST & MORRISON HERSHFIELD 21       Wooded areas are thinned but very little area is cleared. (Note that clearing at least small  areas of spruce further reduces fuel load. The cleared areas then begin the natural process  of succession with far lower risk of fire); and    FireSmart projects can and do provoke public objections that block them from undertaking  fuel reduction activities in certain areas.   The risks of wildfire are expected to increase with climate change and the likely impacts of an  extreme fire for Yukon communities (and especially for Whitehorse) become larger and costlier  every year as fuel loads increase and the community grows. A more aggressive and targeted fuel  reduction effort could significantly reduce this risk. This may be accomplished by exploring a mix  of tested and innovative approaches, including:    Improved community awareness and communications to enhance understanding of wildfire  risks and the importance of fuel reduction and management in reducing those risks;    Selectively cutting and clearing small patches and, where appropriate, replacing significant  amounts of spruce with naturally re-growing aspen, willow and poplar that is less prone to  wildfire; and    Actively maintaining a mix of increased aspen, willow or poplar trees to stop succession back  to spruce.   Building on the above actions, fuel reduction activities also present a further economic  development opportunity by supplying firewood and wood chips for bio-fuel heating. The  Dawson City wastewater treatment plant currently has been using local wood chips for heat for  several years and the Whitehorse Correctional Centre uses a wood pellet fired heating system.  There is considerable opportunity to expand the use of wood heat in Yukon, which presents a  unique synergy between efforts to reduce reliance on fossil-fuels for heating, while increasing  resilience to the impacts of climate change.   The very recent Teslin Tlingit Council (TTC) project to convert ten buildings in Teslin from either  propane or electric heat to a district biomass heating system is an example of the opportunities  to combine adaptation to climate change with local economic development. Some highlights of  the Teslin project include:    Community support for the project was built up over many years, beginning in 1998 in the  TTC forest management plan and being revisited in community plans in 2009 and 2015;    The project identified a sustainable and economical supply of wood chips processed from  locally-sourced waste wood – either from fire smarting activities, development-related, or  from the Teslin Tlingit Council-owned sawmill (Hogan, 2017);    The ongoing operations of the project are anticipated to provide one full-time position plus  an unknown employment benefit from local wood supply contracts.     There is a significant risk attached to not taking more action on fuel reduction as an adaptation  measure. The forest continues to age and wildfire fuel builds up year by year. There are obvious  economic benefits to going forward with a FireSmart Plus approach linked to biomass heating as  is clearly illustrated by the TTC’s efforts in Teslin. Even if greater risks of wildfire do not emerge     Yukon ‘State of Play’:   Analysis of Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation November 14, 2017         RESEARCH NORTHWEST & MORRISON HERSHFIELD 22      from climate change to the degree anticipated, a FireSmart Plus approach will still reduce the  existing risks while providing benefits.         Photo 6: Fighting Yukon Wildfire      (Environment Yukon, 2006)     Yukon ‘State of Play’:   Analysis of Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation November 14, 2017         RESEARCH NORTHWEST & MORRISON HERSHFIELD 23      5. INFRASTRUCTURE   Infrastructure in the  Yukon is already being  impacted by climate  change and the warmer  temperatures, higher  precipitation levels, and  greater weather variability  that is projected will  further increase  environmental stressors to  buildings, roads, power  and communications  systems, water and sewer  systems, and mine sites.  Specific climate change  challenges for Yukon  infrastructure include:    Most existing infrastructure was designed and built based on historical climate data that  may not be appropriate for future conditions. Even small increases in snow load, storm  severity and frequency, and thawing permafrost may directly affect structural integrity;    Buildings sited on permafrost are highly vulnerable as rising temperatures increase the rate  of thaw. The cost of repairs required to keep affected buildings open and functioning is  significant, but there are additional financial and social implications including periods of  closure that negatively affect users (e.g. Dawson City’s recreation centre in 2017);    Thawing permafrost, landslides,  erosion and other climate-driven  damage to infrastructure is having a  major impact on roads and highways  in Yukon. Highways and Public Works  reports higher operating and  maintenance costs for many roads  and bridges related to these climate  impacts. Risks to highway  infrastructure are of concern  because there are limited  transportation corridors through  which consumer goods and critical  supplies can enter the territory;    Thawing permafrost and increased precipitation has led to problems with mine  infrastructure both for operating mines and at abandoned sites. Changes in the hydrological  cycle – especially extreme precipitation events and melt patterns – are creating higher-than- planned-for water flows that can exceed the capacity of water management structures; and   Dempster Highway   Climate-related operations and maintenance   costs for the Dempster highway have increased   significantly in the past two decades. On   average, an additional $200,000 dollars per year   has been needed to maintain the Dempster   highway since 2005 (Burns, 2015). This trend is   expected to continue and financial challenges to   fund major road repairs are anticipated.   Art and Margaret Fry Recreation Centre   In August 2017, engineers deemed large portions of the Art   and Margaret Fry Recreation Centre structurally unsound due   to permafrost thaw, forcing the City of Dawson to close most   of the building for over a month until the decision was made to   re-open in September 2017. In 2009, Yukon government   allocated $4 million in funding to improve the centre, but a   2014 study estimated that $12.5 million in improvement costs   would be required (Yukon News, November 21, 2014). In   addition to repair costs, there are other financial and social   costs — including loss of recreational and social opportunities   and the staff time needed to manage the issue itself — that are   difficult to quantify.     Yukon ‘State of Play’:   Analysis of Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation November 14, 2017         RESEARCH NORTHWEST & MORRISON HERSHFIELD 24       Thawing permafrost and other climate hazards present a growing risk for electricity  generation and distribution infrastructure, including generation facilities and powerlines.      5.1 ADAPTATION TO INFRASTRUCTURE IMPACTS   Increasing the resilience of Yukon’s infrastructure to climate change will require a shift in the  way we think about design requirements of our built environment and the way that we evaluate  the financial costs of construction, maintenance, and repair. Long-term infrastructure planning  that takes future climate change into account will be an important aspect of this work. Other  factors that will influence the resilience of Yukon’s infrastructure to climate change include:    Developing critical infrastructure partnerships with federal government agencies, First  Nations, municipalities and the private sector to access funding and implement  infrastructure adaptation projects (see National Strategy for Critical Infrastructure, 2009;  National Action Plan for Critical Infrastructure, 2014);     Developing and applying new infrastructure standards and best practices. For example, the  Northern Infrastructure Standardization Initiative developed many national standards that  are directly relevant to land-based infrastructure in northern communities such as technical  guidance on factoring in future climate changes when building on permafrost. New  infrastructure design and maintenance standards that recognize climate resilience as a key  objective are currently under development and are expected to be completed by 2020;    Improving mechanisms for monitoring and data collection regarding buildings, roads and  other infrastructure impacts by climate change, and making this information more  accessible and transparent to a wide variety of user groups, may help to stimulate new  insights into climate-resilient design;    Providing opportunity for more innovative building design that leverages lessons learned  and best practices from other jurisdictions. More importantly, this approach may also create   Ross River School   Thawing permafrost beneath the Ross River School has led to structural damage requiring   significant repairs. It was built in 2001 with a thermosiphon system – a method for passive   heat exchange – designed to insulate and maintain the permafrost below the building. The   system has not been successful. The building has required repairs in 2004, 2006, 2013, 2015   and is still in need of further repairs. In 2015, the school was closed for 5 months, a major   disruption in a small community where the school is the center of many activities.   Approximately $3 million was spent on the repairs in 2013 and 2015 and cost estimates for   further repairs are approximately $1.7 million. (CBC North News reports, May 10, 2017, May   29, 2017 and August 4, 2017). In addition to the well-documented repair costs, there are   other financial and social costs — including the disruption of the school year, increased child   care costs, loss of recreational and social opportunities and the staff time needed to   manage the issue itself — that are difficult to quantify.

There are possible economic  benefits in the long-term but also some economic costs. However, a better accounting approach  to infrastructure will not likely result in regrettable outcomes even if the threats to  infrastructure posed by climate change turn out to be less than anticipated.      Photo 7: Thawing Permafrost and Roads      (Environment Yukon)      Yukon ‘State of Play’:   Analysis of Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation November 14, 2017         RESEARCH NORTHWEST & MORRISON HERSHFIELD 26      The Yukon government commonly uses life cycle costing (LCC) to help decide among options for  some infrastructure projects. LCC measures the total cost of infrastructure throughout its life  including planning, design, construction, operations and maintenance, and any other related  costs. LCC is an excellent tool that lays out the financial case for a decision such as whether to  completely renovate an old building for a new use or construct a new building, or to compare  the total costs of trade offs between capital and operating costs (e.g., investing more up front in  energy efficiency to save on operating costs throughout the life of the building).   There is the opportunity for the LCC approach currently used by YG to be expanded to explicitly  encompass climate-related infrastructure risks. Examples might include an LCC analysis of  culvert size selection when building or rebuilding highways. Installing a larger culvert costs more  than a smaller one, but the larger culvert may also prevent road washouts during future flash  flood events. Developing a metric to estimate the (increased) likelihood of such floods and  including the average of repair and disruption costs saved in the LCC may present an  opportunity to improve this decision-making process. Another example may be to develop a  metric to estimate the indirect costs incurred (e.g., loss of recreational and social opportunities)  when buildings are closed for repairs and include it in the LCC analysis from the onset.         The application of full life-cycle cost accounting to the mining industry presents a more complex  challenge. Mining companies build privately-owned infrastructure on public land and generally  have an interest in minimizing their up-front costs. Unless the mining company is large and has  ready access to capital, it may not be able to finance significantly higher capital costs associated  with a full LCC analysis even if those result in net financial benefits in the long-term.    Regulators are already requiring mines to account for climate change in mine design and closure  plans, particularly with respect to water management. Governments and the public have an  interest in ensuring the long-term stability of mine sites, but the industry continues to have a  strong incentive to minimize capital costs and trust that future cash flow and profits will cover  any future climate-driven cost-increases. These conflicting incentives make the application of  full life-cycle cost accounting to the mining industry challenging.      Minto Mine   The Minto copper gold mine in the central Yukon is an example of a successful operating   mine that has struggled to overcome mine design and water management shortcomings   since it began production in 2007. Some of these issues are a result of the site’s   discontinuous permafrost while others stem from higher than expected water levels on site   that exceeded the design requirements it was built for. In 2009, the mine had two   emergency discharges of untreated water into the Yukon River as its water containment   systems were overflowing.   Capstone Mining, owner of the Minto mine, has stated that “…future extreme weather in   Yukon could again result in excess run-off at the mine site, which could have an adverse   effect on the results of operations at the Minto Mine and on our business, financial   condition, results of operation and prospects...” (Capstone Mining Corporation, 2015)          Yukon ‘State of Play’:   Analysis of Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation November 14, 2017         RESEARCH NORTHWEST & MORRISON HERSHFIELD 27      Photo 8: Minto Mine      (Environment Yukon)     Yukon ‘State of Play’:   Analysis of Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation November 14, 2017         RESEARCH NORTHWEST & MORRISON HERSHFIELD 28      6. CHANGING CLIMATE, CHANGING LAND    There is clear evidence that vegetation zones are shifting, forests are more vulnerable to insect  infestations and animal species' habitat, ranges, and diversity are changing. Changes to seasonal  weather patterns and climate variability also have direct impacts on the way that some species  of wildlife feed and breed.   Climate is the most important factor that influences the development of terrestrial ecosystems.  Within areas of similar climate, ecosystems vary because of differences in topography and soil.  Shifting climates within these bioclimate zones may mean that some of the flora and fauna that  have adapted to the historical climate of that area may face increasing ecological pressure under  different present and future climatic conditions. These shifts drive changes in the type of  vegetation that is present or pervasive in certain areas, and also to the seasonal events (e.g.  flowering) in the lifecycle of native plants. Furthermore, climate change may also make areas  more hospitable to invasive species, as it enables some plants, insects and animals to survive  and thrive in parts of the territory that were previously less hospitable.   Photo 9: Caribou      (Environment Yukon, 2009)   Wildlife species ranges are projected to shift northward on both land and sea, bringing new  species into the north while limiting the range of other species already present on those  landscapes. Seasonal changes are also affecting reproductive cycles and species productivity for  some animals. In southern Yukon, for example, seasonal temperature increases have been     Yukon ‘State of Play’:   Analysis of Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation November 14, 2017         RESEARCH NORTHWEST & MORRISON HERSHFIELD 29      shown to advance the breeding cycle of rock and white-tailed ptarmigan and reduce the average  number of eggs produced (Wilson and Marten, 2010). Other documented ecological impacts  include more difficult winter and spring feeding for some animals due to deeper snowpack and  changes to freeze-thaw cycles that lead to thicker layers of ice on and in the snow. Spring and  summer have also seen greater levels of insect harassment of caribou (Furgal and Prowse, 2008;  Streicker, 2016), which interrupts summer feeding, reducing overall animal health and leading to  reduced reproduction.     Aquatic species are also affected by changes in water temperature and other climate change  impacts to Yukon’s hydrological regimes. Climate change-related impacts on ocean and fresh- water habitats for wild salmon exacerbate existing environmental and human-caused stressors,  jeopardising migration and reducing reproductive success. According to the federal department  of Fisheries and Oceans, the annual Yukon River Chinook salmon migration has historically  reached up to 150,000 fish; by 2016 this number declined to less than 75,000, and salmon  productivity has been consistently low since 2008. In response, several Yukon First Nations have  imposed restrictions on salmon fishing for their citizens, cancelling or limiting the amount of fish  available for seasonal fish camps.   The cumulative impacts of these ecological, biological and hydrological impacts are less well  understood. How these changes will impact the health of keystone species like caribou and  salmon, which serve as indicators of overall ecosystem health, is of significant concern for  Yukoners – especially Yukon First Nations whose traditional culture, diet and livelihoods are  intimately connected with Yukon’s landscapes and wildlife.   6.1 ADAPTATION TO THE CHANGING LAND   Yukon First Nations have a long history of adaptation to changing landscapes and wildlife.      30,000 Years   “People have lived in what is now called the Yukon for perhaps 30,000 years. During that   long period both the climate and the landscape have changed. The weather was sometimes   much colder than it is now, sometimes warmer. For at least half of the last 30,000 years,   instead of being covered by forests, most of the land was mossy or grassy tundra…The lakes   too have changed in number, location, and shape. Rivers once flowed in places where there   are none today, and salmon once spawned where they do no longer. Many of the animals   that the early peoples hunted were unlike those they hunt today…” (McClelland. 1987. P.17)     Yukon ‘State of Play’:   Analysis of Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation November 14, 2017         RESEARCH NORTHWEST & MORRISON HERSHFIELD 30      Several Yukon First Nations have undertaken community-based research and adaptation   planning to evaluate and respond to the effects of climate change on their land, water, and   wildlife. For example, Selkirk First Nation partnered with the Arctic Institute of Community   Based Research to develop a community based climate change adaptation plan (VanBibber and   Pratt 2016). This plan emphasized, among other aspects, the resiliency of the community and   ability to adapt as well as the importance of initiatives to connect youth with the land and work   to improve the mental wellness of young people in the community.      Shifting species distributions may also provide future opportunities for hunting/trapping (e.g.   deer) and warmer temperatures may contribute to higher survival rates for certain species.   However, the cumulative negative effects may outweigh these benefits. Currently, very little is   known about the full extent of ecological impacts on complex natural systems that will result   from climate change and how those impacts will interact with the landscapes and the animals   that are valued for food and other human uses. There is a lot of concern, but also a high level of   uncertainty.    Anticipating how regional ecological systems will be affected by climate change is very   important in determining the potential effects on traditional lifestyles and ecosystem services.   Ensuring that planning processes (land-use planning, development planning, park planning,   forestry, etc.) explicitly incorporate mechanisms for anticipating and accommodating future   climate change will influence the durability and effectiveness of land and resource planning   initiatives.   6.1.1 Adaptation Opportunity: Agriculture  Yukon’s agricultural sector is limited not only by soil, but by temperature and precipitation.   As   noted in Section 2, climate change has already resulted in 20C higher annual average   temperatures and a 6% increase in average annual precipitation. Further change is expected to   bring even higher average temperatures and generally higher levels of precipitation.    Southern Tutchone Resilience   “There are many examples of Southern Tutchone people being extremely resilient and   adaptable to change in the past, including the dynamic land, the Gold Rush, the   construction of the Alaska Highway, residential school, the dam construction at Aishihik   Lake, the pipeline coming through, etc. Change has always been happening...  The   conclusion of this study is that Southern Tutchone people are used to change and making it   work for them.” (Champagne and Aishihik First Nations and Alsek Renewable Resources   Council, 2009)     Yukon ‘State of Play’:   Analysis of Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation November 14, 2017         RESEARCH NORTHWEST & MORRISON HERSHFIELD 31      Higher average temperatures bring longer   growing seasons by increasing the average   number of frost-free days. In the Canadian   prairies, Agriculture Canada is anticipating   significant increases in the length of the   growing season over wide areas based on a   predicted 10C to 20C increase in average   temperatures over the 2009 to 2032   period. For example, while 33.6% of the   area had a growing season longer than 130   days in the 1971-2000 period, that is   expected to increase to 56.6% of the area   by 2032.    Although a similar level of analysis has not been done for the Yukon, a similar lengthening of the   growing season can likely be expected. And the increased summer precipitation from climate   change will also increase agricultural potential and decrease irrigation needs and costs. Some   general trends that emerge from the 2016 Census of agriculture, which largely combines the   Yukon with the NWT, include:    The number of farms was largely unchanged from 2011 to 2016;    The area of cropland remained stable from 2011 to 2016 but there was a shift away from  hay to the production of field crops, particularly field pea production;    The total area dedicated to fruit and berry production more than doubled between 2011  and 2016 while greenhouse production has fallen;    Overall the agriculture sector in Yukon and NWT reported gross receipts of $10.0 million for  2015, significantly higher than the $4.1 million in 2005; and    Poultry and egg farms accounted for 44% of reported gross receipts in 2015.   Increasing Yukon agriculture is a low-risk climate change adaptation opportunity. It is an   opportunity that may yield significant economic benefits and if properly managed does not have   significant downsides if the climate threat turns out to not be as severe as some scenarios   projected.    Factors other than climate change that may help to further increase Yukon agricultural   production include:    General trends toward higher demand for more local food. In the Yukon, the popularity of  farmer’s markets has been rising: Dawson City, Haines Junction, Mayo and Whitehorse have  all established local farmers markets (Yukon News, April 21, 2017).          The increased attention and interest in food security and the role of local food production in  enhancing food security in the territory, particularly among rural First Nations communities.  Since 2005, food security-related adaptation projects have been pursued by the Teslin  Tlingit Council, White River First Nation, Little Salmon Carmacks First Nation, Liard First  Nation, Vuntut G’witchin, and the Kluane First Nation. Little Salmon Carmacks First Nation   Willingness to Buy Local Food   “The consumers in the Yukon show a strong   desire to buy locally. This can be seen in the   support for community markets, and in   strong farm gate sales. This has also   translated into high premiums for a limited   amount of Yukon production. This local   premium may be as high as two to four- fold   over imported production.” (Serecon, 2007 P.   A15)     Yukon ‘State of Play’:   Analysis of Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation November 14, 2017         RESEARCH NORTHWEST & MORRISON HERSHFIELD 32      began a community greenhouse and garden program in 2000 and other communities and  First Nations have made similar efforts, including the Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in Teaching and  Working Farm, which began in 2015.      The price premium that many are willing to pay for local food. “There are studies that show  that consumers are willing to pay a premium for local products (Brown 2003; Schneider and  Francis 2005; Novotorova and Mazzocco 2008; Darby, Batte, Ernst and Roe 2008). But this  willingness to pay a premium is apparently contingent on local products being readily  available and easy to identify” (Equiterre, 2011).     The very small amount of local food in proportion to the total market for food in the Yukon.  The total gross receipts of farms (both Yukon and NWT) was $10.0 million in 2015 as noted  above. The Yukon Bureau of Statistics reports that food and beverage stores in the Yukon  had $203.4 million in sales in 2015. The farm receipts include sales (e.g., hay for horses) that  do not directly compare to grocery sales and there are significant grocery sales that cannot  be displaced by local production (e.g., soft drinks) but the numbers do indicate that local  food has a lot of room to grow its market share in the Yukon.          Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in Teaching and Working Farm   In 2015 the Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in First Nation stated the Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in Teaching and   Working Farm in the Klondike Valley near Dawson City. In the summer of 2017, the farm had   22 students of varying ages, most of them post-secondary. “Students spend three hours a   day in classes, which are taught in a large, open-air frame tent. The other four and a half   hours of the day are spent in practicum, doing things like tending the sprawling garden   beds, planting seedlings, operating and maintaining farm machinery and taking care of the   pigs. Most students live on-site in small frame tents.” (Yukon News, July 4, 2017)     Yukon ‘State of Play’:   Analysis of Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation November 14, 2017         RESEARCH NORTHWEST & MORRISON HERSHFIELD 33      7. HUMAN HEALTH AND WELLBEING   Human health and wellbeing can be impacted by climate change in a variety of ways, from  exposure to new disease and vectors to physical and psychological health effects of anxiety and  stress from extreme weather events or wildfire damaging homes or livelihoods.    Over the long-term, climate  change is projected to make the  Yukon more hospitable to  invasive species that are likely to  bring with them both vector- borne and zoonotic diseases.  Vectors are organisms (usually  insects) that transmit pathogens  or parasites from one person (or  animal or plant) to another.  Zoonotic diseases are diseases  that normally infect animals but  can make the jump to human  populations. Both can cause  human illness and can negatively  impact plants or animals that contribute to the food security and livelihoods of Yukoners.  Climate change may also increase existing health-risks connected to climate-driven hazards or  relationships between humans and natural ecosystems.   According to the 2012 Yukon Health Status Report (Government of Yukon, 2012), many  Whitehorse households and most rural households obtain at least some food from hunting (33%  and 58%) or fishing (44% and 62%). These traditional food sources, and our ability to access  these animals over land and water, are affected by shifting weather patterns and seasonal  changes occurring here in Yukon. This may generate changes in diet that lead to physical health  impacts, but also has implications for the mental health and psychological wellbeing of Yukon’s  First Nations people whose ability to participate in traditional cultural activities that are  intimately connected with traditional foods may become more limited.    The Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation is one of several  Yukon First Nations who have taken steps to  better understand the impact of climate change  on human health and wellbeing. Between 2007  and 2011, the First Nation undertook a multi- phased project to solicit community feedback on  local climate change impacts in the Vuntut  Gwitchin traditional territory, understand  historical adaptations to address food-related  concerns, and develop new actions to improve  community food security (Arctic Institute for  Community-Based Research, 2017).   Ticks in the North   In the summer of 2017, a black-legged tick was   discovered in Yellowknife, one of the most northern   locations in Canada that this insect has been   documented. The black-legged tick, also known as the   “deer tick” can be a carrier of Lyme disease. According   to Canadian Lyme Disease Foundation president Jim   Wilson, deer ticks are becoming increasingly resilient to   colder climates, and it is expected that more of these   insects will arrive in the north over the coming years.   (CBC North News. June 13, 2017).   Mental Health   “Many northern communities consider   traditional practices as a pathway to   mental health and wellness for First   Nation youth” Adapting to Climate   Change and Keeping Our Traditions:   Selkirk First Nation Adaptation Plan.   (VanBibber and Pratt 2016)        Yukon ‘State of Play’:   Analysis of Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation November 14, 2017         RESEARCH NORTHWEST & MORRISON HERSHFIELD 34      Photo 10: Drying Fish      (Environment Yukon)   Extreme weather events and wildfire also have direct and indirect implications for human health  and wellbeing. Flooding events affect the safety of individuals, the health of those whose  drinking water quality is impacted or whose access to medical supplies or treatment is affected  by flooding events, and the mental wellness of people whose property and living conditions are  negatively impacted. Similarly, wildfires that lead to community evacuations or property  damage can have significant impacts on the people in those areas. Furthermore, anticipated  increases in wildfire activity presents the potential for increased respiratory health impacts  related to wildfire smoke. In 2017, Yukon government’s Department of Health and Social  Services initiated a project to improve monitoring of wildfire impacts on human health and  improve emergency planning for extreme weather events and wildfires.     Yukon ‘State of Play’:   Analysis of Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation November 14, 2017         RESEARCH NORTHWEST & MORRISON HERSHFIELD 35      The threats posed by climate change to human health and wellbeing are a function of many  factors, including exposure to climate hazards, sensitivity of exposed populations to  environmental changes (especially the elderly and persons with pre-existing health conditions),  and the capacity of the individuals or populations to proactively plan for change and/or to  respond to disaster (Seguin, 2008; Seguin and Berry, 2008; Costello et al., 2009).    7.1 HEALTH AND WELLBEING ADAPTATION   Understanding the implications of climate change for public health and wellbeing depends  largely on our understanding of the breadth and depth of the relationship between climate and  health, and extent to which forward-looking public health programming incorporates climate  change considerations.    Specific opportunities to improve Yukon’s capacity to understand and respond to direct and  indirect climate change impacts on the health and wellbeing of its residents include:     Enhancing data collection and investing in research on the role of country foods in Yukoners’  diets, and the impact of climate change on availability and access to traditional foods;    Identifying populations most at risk to climate change-related health risks and developing  strategies and actions to increase awareness of these risks among these groups;    Enhancing mental health services in communities and supporting programs and initiatives  that enable First Nations to reconnect with traditional land-use activities; and    Investing in capacity to address health-related vulnerabilities that are increased by climate  change, such as food and housing security, poverty and marginalization.   Examples (see 9.APPENDIX B) of work on communities beginning to adapt to the health and  wellbeing issues of climate change include:    “Pilot Study on the Health Effects on the Selkirk First Nation due to Climate Change” in 2009;    “Climate Change and Health – Linking our Past and Future through our Traditions and  Culture: An Ethno-Botanical Resource Study to determine the Effects of Climate Change on  Traditional Ecosystems” in 2010; and    "Keeping our traditions for the mental wellbeing of Selkirk First Nations Youth: What do we  do at the fish camp when there is no fish?" in 2016.   7.1.1 Adaptation Opportunity: Community-Based Climate Monitoring   Community-based climate change monitoring initiatives may provide new opportunities to  gather valuable data on impacts of climate change, while simultaneously enabling community  members to re-connect with traditional and land-based knowledge.   Not taking the action of further community-based monitoring does pose some risks as lack of  local and community-specific data limits the effectiveness of adaptation efforts. It is important  that initiatives to establish community-based monitoring programs consider how monitoring  might help address local needs and vulnerabilities such as concern about the condition and  populations of local game species.     Yukon ‘State of Play’:   Analysis of Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation November 14, 2017         RESEARCH NORTHWEST & MORRISON HERSHFIELD 36      While the impacts of climate change on wildlife, and especially traditional sources of food, is of  great concern for Yukoners, there is limited scientific research on what these impacts will mean  in practical terms both for wildlife and for the population who rely on them for food. A  community-based climate monitoring program that provides resources and training for  community residents to monitor and collect data on key ecological indicators of climate change  could help to address this information gap while also providing modest economic benefit to  Yukon communities.   Integrating the data collected through this program with existing research and information  available through other public agencies (e.g. statistics on traditional food consumption, wildlife  population health data, forest health information, etc.) may help to provide improved insights  into the long-term implications of climate change for human health. The data can also be used  to inform and guide natural resource planning and development to ensure that regional  ecosystems and their capacity to support important traditional plant and animal species are  sustainably managed.     Beyond the information-gathering component of these initiatives, community-based climate  monitoring provides a valuable opportunity to integrate traditional knowledge and scientific  research on climate change and create new opportunities to re-connect with the land for  individuals who may be feeling alienated from traditional land-use activities. Historical insight  into local climate indicators related to, for example, the timing of seasonally significant events  such as the first snowfall, sightings of migratory birds, and the budding of flowers in spring  provide a deeper understanding of long-term climate trends in specific geographic regions. This  type of traditional and local knowledge could feed into such initiatives by soliciting the  participation of First Nations elders and contribute to cultural revitalization by providing a  framework to promote and preserve land-based skills and knowledge for younger community  members. (Lemmen et. al. 2016).   Community-based climate monitoring programs are low-risk regardless of how severe the  effects of climate change turn out to be. There is an opportunity for communities to benefit in  different ways from the programs and their costs tend to be relatively low.
