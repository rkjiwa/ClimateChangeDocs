The prevail-  ing view is that many new jobs will be created as the economy shifts from   dirty energy production to clean, renewable energy.  The authors of this study find the claims exaggerated. They show that   Canadian energy policy is explicitly driven by private market-based deci-  sions, rather than careful planning by government to ensure both good en-  vironmental and labour outcomes. To the extent that there is public plan-  ning, it is focused on delivering outcomes that the energy industry wants,   rather than taking into account long-term climate change improvements.   This has implications both for the greening of the energy sector, and the   types of jobs that are being created.  Rather than public policy in Canada focusing on the planning and train-  ing of a ‘green’ workforce, it reinforces reliance on traditional energy em-  ployment.  The findings indicate that Canada’s employment growth in the oil and   gas sector, despite the ‘green’ washing that occurs, for the most part, reflects   an increase in non-conventional types of fossil fuel production (tar sands,   shale and tight gas). These extraction methods tend to be environmental-  ly even more problematic than conventional oil and gas production. The   resulting jobs are similar to those that have been created in the past. New   production in renewable industries such as wind and solar is more labour-  intensive than in existing electricity production, but still constitutes a very     6 Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives  small proportion of the market so far. While these industries are likely to   grow considerably by 2020, their job creation potential is relatively small.  The paper includes a detailed discussion of employment trends in the   energy sector by gender, age, types of occupations, and level of trade union   membership. It also provides considerable information about future labour   needs in the renewable sectors. In virtually all areas of energy development,   there are skills shortages and the need for additional training. These short-  ages cover a wide range of different occupations, from engineers and archi-  tects to skilled trades, equipment operators, technicians and even construc-  tion labourers. Skills shortages also vary, regionally and by energy sector.   Most of the shortages are for jobs in conventional energy production. How-  ever, the renewable sector is also experiencing significant shortages of quali-  fied personnel.  The kinds of jobs needed in the renewable energy sector are not mark-  edly different from those required in the major energy sectors. While the   labour force of the energy sector has traditionally been largely male from   within Canada, labour shortages may force changes here. Job creation in the   electricity sector through green projects is characterized by small numbers   of permanent jobs, but under more unfavourable working conditions than   existed with electricity generation in the public sector. This is primarily be-  cause most new ‘green’ electricity projects are being built by the private sec-  tor, even though they are funded by public utilities. Almost all of the jobs cre-  ated are short-term construction jobs, usually through non-union projects.  The authors also examine the role of organized labour in advancing   green jobs in the energy sector. Trade unions have developed a number of   concrete proposals, which they define as a ‘just transition’ strategy. Their   goal is both to expand green employment and to ensure that these new   jobs are decent jobs. However, neither federal, nor provincial governments   treat trade unions as significant players in the policy process. This is a re-  flection of the failure of Canadian governments to establish an industrial   policy that incorporates a major green employment component. To the ex-  tent that unions have a voice in shaping policy it is largely restricted to a   relatively narrow area dealing with training and other aspects of workforce   development. While this is not insignificant, governments are ignoring the   views, experiences and objectives of trade unions in formulating their over-  all energy policies.  The paper argues that we need a fundamental rethinking of where Can-  ada is going in its energy policy. The country needs a comprehensive strategy   that would base its priorities on the urgent need to address global warming.     Climate Change and the Canadian Energy Sector 7  The strategy should include a much stronger government role in shaping Can-  ada’s energy future. It should also include a larger role for industrial policy   and a comprehensive training and employment program. Trade unions, as   well as environmentalists and civil society have much to contribute. They   need to be included in the development of a more environmentally respon-  sible approach to addressing climate change, one that does not rely simply   on furthering the individual market-based decisions of the corporate sector.      Climate Change and the Canadian Energy Sector 9  Introduction  global warming (or climate change) will be Canada’s most important   environmental, economic, and public policy challenge in the coming years.   A growing body of research is interested in the various ways dealing with   climate change will affect Canadians. The possible impact on labour is also   gaining attention in anticipation of a shift from a carbon intensive to a dif-  ferent kind of economy (Ubc 2009). These changes potentially could have   both contractive and expansive effects (Hildebrand et al 2009). The contract-  ive effects relate to the ways that actions taken to reduce carbon use could   result in lower economic activity and, therefore higher unemployment. The   expansive effects relate to new industries and jobs that may arise as a result   of abatement or mitigation policies. Of particular interest is how new forms   of work could lessen the negative impacts on the economy if there is a switch   to greater use of renewable resources in the energy sector (Marshall 2002).  The purpose of this research is to examine what is known about the   impact of climate change on labour in one sector of the Canadian econ-  omy — energy production. This sector is significant for two main reasons:   the production of energy is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions in   Canada, and public policy in various jurisdictions is beginning to focus on   the ways that some energy production, mainly electricity, could become   more reliant on renewable resources (or ‘green’ energy).  To explore this issue, we first examine some of the basic characteristics   of the energy sector itself, including the major production trends in its vari-  ous components — oil, gas, electricity and coal production — to understand     10 Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives  output levels projected for the near future. Second, we analyze the policy   context in which Canada’s energy future is being determined and the role   governments play and could play in determining that future. Most signifi-  cant for ‘green’ employment in the industry is the extent the future will be   shaped by market based decisions or by pro-active government decisions   that may move Canada in different directions.  Third, we examine what has been happening to the energy sector work-  force to understand where people are currently employed and how this em-  ployment has changed over time. Included in this will be an examination of   the characteristics of the workforce in terms of gender, age and other demo-  graphic characteristics, and the extent that the labour force is represented by   trade unions. Our fourth objective is to understand how climate change in-  itiatives are likely to change the nature of work in the industry and the char-  acteristics of the workforce. Included in this discussion will be an analysis   of the role of trade unions in the energy sector and how climate change in-  itiatives may affect their ability to protect workers in the future.    Climate Change and the Canadian Energy Sector 11  Canada’s Energy  Production Sector  canada’s energy prodUcTion sector includes a broad range of differ-  ent energy sources, technologies, facilities and employment patterns.2 The   principal sources of energy are: oil, natural gas, coal, nuclear power, large   hydro, and various renewable sources such as wind, run of river hydro,   solar, biomass and geothermal. Despite the considerable attention govern-  ments have given to expanding low ghg sources of energy, in reality fossil   fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal continue to dominate energy produc-  tion. Also, new investments are occurring in the further exploitation of fos-  sil fuels, particularly the expansion of the tar sands3, unconventional gas,   and offshore oil and natural gas.  Energy production is a major source of ghg emissions in Canada, ac-  counting for 274.5 megatonnes of ghg emissions in 2008, an increase of   slightly over 40% from the 196.7 megatonnes generated in 1990. In 2008,   the energy production sector contributed 37.4% to Canada’s total ghg emis-  sions, an increase from 35.6% in 1990. Currently the oil and gas sector con-  tributes over 21% of all ghg emissions and the electricity sector over 16%   (Canadian Energy Research Institute (ceri) 2009, p. vii).4  While conventional oil output declined in recent years from its peak in   1973, output from the tar sands has been expanding rapidly. It now consti-  tutes more than half of Canada’s oil production. The tar sands’ share of total   oil production is projected to increase much more in the coming years due     12 Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives  to major new investments planned by industry to exploit an estimated 173   billion barrels of bitumen. One recent study estimates that during the per-  iod from 2009 to 2025, total investment in the oil sands alone will amount   to $373 billion (ceri 2009, p. vii). The National Energy Board (neb) expects   the tar sands to constitute three-quarters of the supply by 2020. Both shale   and tight gas are similarly expected to increase significantly and account   for two-thirds of all gas production by 2020, compared with one-third pres-  ently (neb 2009).  The large scale investments in oil and gas create relatively few jobs com-  pared to other sectors of the economy. Employment impacts tend to be con-  centrated in the planning, exploration, development and construction of   energy projects and related infrastructure, as well as in the transportation   requirements associated with building and servicing these projects. These   jobs are mostly short term in nature (Canadian Energy and Paperworkers   Union (cep) 2009; Newcomb 2004). Long term employment in energy con-  struction is contingent on continuing expansion of energy projects (Garner   Pinfold Consulting 2008). Manufacturing linkages for materials and equip-  ment, as well as related administrative and technical services, do provide   some additional employment, particularly in Ontario and Quebec (Canadian   Association of Petroleum Producers 2009). But imports also meet a significant   share of the demand for manufactured goods needed in the energy sector.  Like production of oil and gas, electricity production shows no signs of   abatement and has increased significantly since 1993, with minor downturns   primarily reflecting fluctuations in economic activity.5 The major structur-  al changes in this sector relate to the shift away from coal for electrical gen-  eration, which has affected employment associated with coal production,   and the general change in the electricity market itself, as it moves away from   a predominately government owned utilities model, where increased pro-  duction and distribution is planned to meet growing needs, toward a more   market-oriented model of production.6 Two factors have contributed to the   changes in the industry: one was a response to pressures to adopt the U.S.   move toward a more market-oriented approach, and the other was pressure   from private power producers to have the ability to compete in the market   (esc, p. 25; cea 2004, p. 12).  Also like oil and gas, Canada’s electricity production is capital inten-  sive, creating relatively few permanent jobs compared with other sectors of   the Canadian economy. Total employment was 104,000 workers (Statistics   Canada 2007, table 7.1). Canada’s utilities (excluding industrial self genera-  tion output) produced 575 terawatt hours (TWh) of energy in 2009 (Statis-    Climate Change and the Canadian Energy Sector 13  tics Canada 2009). Electricity production is dominated by large hydro (58%)   with coal (17%), nuclear (15%) and natural gas (6%) playing lesser, but still   significant, roles in some provinces. Despite the increasing focus on new   sources of ‘green’ energy, large hydro remains the predominant source of   renewable electricity and renewable energy in Canada (See Appendix I for   figures). Some consider nuclear energy ‘green’ energy and this may well play   an increasing role in Canada in the future.7 Nuclear generation accounts for   14.6% of Canada’s electricity generation with the greatest concentration in   Ontario, where it provides 51% of the province’s power needs. In addition   to Ontario nuclear power is also produced in Quebec and New Brunswick.   According to Industry Canada, the nuclear generation industry employs   about 21,000 people directly and 10,000 indirectly. The multiplier effect from   direct and indirect work in the nuclear industry is about 40,000 jobs (www.  ic.gc.ca/eic/site/mse-epe.nsf/eng/home).  Proposals for expanding the share of renewable energy sources in Can-  ada’s energy production mix tend to focus primarily on further greening the   electricity sector through the construction of new hydro, wind, solar, tidal,   FIgure 1 Total Electricity Production in Canada By Fuel Type  Hydro  Coal  Nuclear  Gas Oil  Wind (Waste=0%)Biomass  Source Electricity Sector Council 2008.

So far, new renewable electri-  city (as opposed to existing large hydro) is still a relatively small contributor   to overall energy supplies. Wind energy, the fastest growing and largest part   of the renewable sector, still accounts for less than 1% of electricity output.   Despite the attention given to the need to expand the role of new renew-  ables in Canada’s energy mix, they are unlikely to make a major impact in   replacing fossil fuels or nuclear generation the near future, however desir-  able this objective may be in reducing ghg emissions.  At present, renewable energy projects tend to be relatively more expen-  sive per unit of energy produced compared with coal, oil and natural gas.   Part of the reason is that they are also more labour intensive both to con-  struct and, in some cases, such as biofuels, to maintain and operate (Kam-  men et al 2006; Blue/Green Alliance 2009; U.S. Dept. Energy 2005, p. 12).   They are normally much smaller in size, reducing opportunities to bene-  fit from economies of scale. While from an employment perspective this is   beneficial, from the perspective of cost, it constitutes a major barrier to their   expansion (Calvert 2007 pp. 91–93). Consequently, governments wishing to   expand green energy production have had to provide substantial subsides,   either by paying high prices for new renewable energy or by providing tax   breaks and other financial incentives to energy investors.    Climate Change and the Canadian Energy Sector 15  The Policy Context  canada’s abiliTy To meet the challenges arising from climate change   and, consequently, the nature of the labour force demands and character-  istics in the energy sector will depend, in part, on the kinds of policies that   federal and provincial governments follow in the coming years. The current   federal government, along with most provinces, has adopted the view that   the role of government is essentially one of supporting market based, pri-  vate sector solutions both to energy development and to Canada’s response   to climate change. The Federal Government has been explicit about its com-  mitment to the energy sector’s “market orientation,” which it believes will   provide the most efficient guide to meeting Canada’s future energy needs.   An example of the Federal Government’s policy approach is explained on   the Natural Resources Canada web site.  Canada’s energy policy is guided by a series of principles, agreements and   accords. The main principles of our energy policy are:  • A market orientation: Markets are the most efficient means of deter-  mining supply, demand, prices and trade while ensuring an efficient,   competitive and innovative energy system that is responsive to Can-  ada’s energy needs.  • Respect for jurisdictional authority and the role of the provinces: Prov-  incial governments are the direct managers of most of Canada’s resour-    16 Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives  ces and have responsibilities for resource management within their bor-  ders (Natural Resources Canada, nd).8  In relying on market forces and existing institutional and treaty arrange-  ments, the federal government seems to assume that it does not need to   carry out long range planning or adopt an activist policy agenda that would   take Canada in a direction different from that which market forces would   otherwise dictate. The federal government seems prepared to intervene in   some cases, but primarily through the support of market based policy, while   minimizing direct regulation of the energy market. The apparent approach   is that national leadership will not be required to plan and shape how Can-  ada will ‘green’ its energy sector. The Constitutional role of provinces/terri-  tories as resource owners reinforces the belief that national public planning   should be limited to supporting private initiatives. This has led to a patch-  work quilt of uncoordinated policies and a continuing reliance on the ex-  ploitation and export of fossil fuel (Doern & Gattinger 2003; Dwivedi, Kyba,   Stoett, Tiessen 2001).  This market-oriented method also means a continuation of the very sub-  stantial fossil fuel subsidies currently in place (Warnock 2006).9 The tax and   royalty regimes of both levels of government have been shaped by the goal   of expediting the exploitation of Canada’s fossil fuel resources and, in recent   years, a commitment to continued private ownership of the resource.10 In-  dustry payments to governments are low by international standards, while   environmental regulations are widely criticized as being far too industry   friendly.11 While the long term costs of viewing the environment largely as   an ‘externality’ are not easy to calculate, in provinces such as Alberta they   are likely to be very significant (Clarke 2008; McCullum nd.).  Reliance on market forces has also meant eschewing the development   of an explicit industrial strategy that would move the energy sector towards   more labour intensive, green jobs. In a number of European countries such   as Denmark and Germany — and, to a lesser degree in parts of the U.S. — na-  tional and state/provincial governments have consciously attempted to link   their efforts to build a green energy sector with the development of new   manufacturing and related energy service industries (Lehr et al 2008; Bo-  ettcher et al 2009; Ayee et al 2009; Engel and Kammen 2009). They believe   that employment and skills development in these sectors can make a con-  tribution equal to, or in some cases greater than, the creation of jobs in the   construction and installation of energy generation facilities. These govern-    Climate Change and the Canadian Energy Sector 17  ments view subsidization of green energy initiatives as a springboard to the   development of a world class renewable manufacturing sector.  International experience indicates that most manufacturing in the re-  newable energy sector occurs in countries where there is considerable gov-  ernment support (Germany, U.S. (led by states), Spain, India, and China)   and where this support is part of a larger industrial strategy. Unfortunately,   growing reliance on private sector development in Canada for green energy   in all renewable energy projects reduces government leverage to encourage   the domestic production of inputs.  To the extent that public pressure has encouraged governments to pur-  sue ‘green’ energy in Canada, provincial governments have generally taken   the lead, although the federal government has provided some limited sub-  sidies and tax breaks to stimulate private investment in this sector.12 Where   provinces, such as BC, have encouraged expansion of private ‘green energy’   projects, they have normally chosen not to impose local, or national, in-  dustrial offset requirements as a condition of public support (BC Energy   Plans, 2002, 2007 and BC Clean Energy Act, 2010). Rather, using the excuse   of commitments to various trade agreements (e.g., the Agreement on Inter-  nal Trade, Tilma and other provincial trade agreements), they ignore this   type of public policy tool, leaving corporations free to source components   and services in national and international markets.  Ontario is one province that has an energy program that requires lo-  cal content for participating in the feed-in-tariff (FiT) programs, which in-  clude substantial subsidies to green energy providers. The energy program   requires that up to 60% of the inputs of all green energy projects be manu-  factured in the province after 2011. This strategy is specifically designed to   create local jobs in manufacturing. The project was successful in attracting   foreign investors to manufacture in the province with the largest deal go-  ing to Korean based Samsung which received a $7 billion contract to locate   manufacturing plants within the province. In September 2010 Japan initi-  ated dispute settlement proceedings against Canada at the World Trade Or-  ganization (wTo) with the complaint that Ontario’s green energy plan un-  fairly pressures its producers of clean power to buy hardware from local   manufactures (Bridges Trade BioRes, vol 10, no 17). Japan argues that the   local content requirement for green energy producers to qualify for a gen-  erous guaranteed purchase price violates wTo national agreement obliga-  tions, breaches the Agreement on Trade-Related Investment Measures, and   constitutes a prohibited subsidy. Both the EU and the U.S. have joined Japan   in this complaint against Canada. The U.S. notes that it is Canada’s primary     18 Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives  source of imports for renewable energy, and has considerable concerns about   subsidies for local content (Bridges Weekly, vol 14, no 34).  A win for Japan at the wTo on this issue would very effectively obstruct   the development of hardware manufacturing for solar and wind energy pro-  jects in Canada. However, local content requirements are increasingly seen   in green energy policies of governments throughout the world, primarily be-  cause of the extensive subsidies governments are providing the private sec-  tor to develop this energy. A similar case filed by the United Steelworkers   union against China for unfairly subsidizing its domestic renewables mar-  ket underlies the basic issues: the extent that domestic content is considered   crucial to energy security and future economic growth (Bradsher 2010).    Climate Change and the Canadian Energy Sector 19  Current Employment in  the Energy Sector  while The energy production sector has a major impact on Canada’s   economy, direct employment in the sector provides only a small share of   the nation’s jobs. Total direct employment is slightly under 300,000 work-  ers, or roughly 1.8% of Canada’s 17 million employed workforce in 2009.13  Employment in the energy sector in Canada has increased steadily in the   21st century and all projections by the government and the industries indi-  cate that it will continue to increase into the future. However, there are fluc-  tuations in the long term upward trend. For example, during the 1990s em-  ployment in the largest sectors, electricity, oil and gas, and services dropped   dramatically. The electricity sector went from employing 112,600 workers in   1993 to 85,900 in 2000 (Electricity Sector Council (esc) 2008). Oil and gas ex-  traction employed about 32,200 workers in 1991, but dropped about 10,000   workers by 1996 (Statistics Canada, Employment (seph), Table 281-0024-4,14).  Employment in the electricity and oil and gas industries, which account   for over half of all energy sector jobs, has almost completely recovered from   the economic downturns of the 1990s. The oil and gas sectors are now grow-  ing more rapidly than the electricity sector, which still has employment lev-  els slightly below what it experienced in the early 1990s. Support services   have expanded dramatically and this area is now the second largest source   of employment in the energy sector, after electricity.    20 Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives  As can be seen in Figure 2, of the entire energy sector only employment   in coal mining has declined steadily since 1991 and now employs about   half of what it did in 1991.14 This specifically relates to changes to shift from   coal-fired electricity production to cleaner forms of energy, much of which   has been driven by public policy such the Ontario government’s decision   to phase out its coal-fired power stations (Ontario, Green Energy and Green   Economy Act, 2009).  Canada’s employment growth in the oil and gas sector, for the most part,   reflects an increase in non-conventional types of fossil fuel production.   These methods tend to be environmentally even more problematic than con-  ventional oil and gas production due, in part, to the significant volumes of   natural gas required to create steam for bitumen extraction, and the need   to clear large areas for surface mining and tailings ponds.  Because of the increased production of non-conventional fossil fuels,   employment trends in Canada are diverging from those in the U.S. and Eur-  ope. Unlike these jurisdictions, Canada is not experiencing overall reduc-  tions in employment in the fossil fuel (or dirty) energy sectors.

Like the EU and the U.S., Canada is experiencing a decline   in conventional oil while conventional gas production remains flat (plmi   2009). The major difference in Canada is that it has large deposits of uncon-  ventional forms of fossil fuels, such a shale and tight gas that are beginning   to be developed.15 Canada is also planning to increase extraction of oil from   the tar sands, including proposals for major new pipelines to export this oil.   In 2009, synthetic and bitumen production (77,266 thousand cubic metres)   overtook conventional oil production (70,615 thousand cubic metres) for the   first time in Canada’s history (capp 2010, table 3.1b and 3.3a).16 These new   oil sources indicate that fossil fuel resource availability will continue to gen-  erate expanded labour demands in these areas.  The major drivers for employment in the electricity sector in the future   will be in new infrastructure to meet growing demand (both for domestic   use and exports), and replacement needs (Electricity Sector Council (esc)   2008, p. 39; cea 2004). Given the age of much of Canada’s electricity infra-  structure, considerable investment will be required to replace existing trans-  FIgure 3 Changes in Canadian Population and Electricity Demand (Index: 1990=100)  100  110  120  130  1990 1995 2000 2005 2009  Changes in Population  Changes in Electricity Demand  Source Calculated from Statistics Canada, Energy Statistics Handbook 2011, Fourth Quarter 2010, p. 32    22 Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives  mission lines, turbine generators and aging power plants. Although Can-  ada is a major consumer of electricity and uses more on a per person basis   (at 17,307 KWh) than does the U.S. (at 13,640 KWh), according to the esc,   per capita electricity consumption is not expected to decrease in the future   (esc 2008, p. 41).17 As can be seen in Figure 3, electricity consumption is ris-  ing faster than population growth in Canada.18  According to a 2006 Natural Resources Canada (nrc) forecast, electri-  city consumption is projected to increase by 1.3% annually until 2020 with   most growth occurring in the commercial market (nrc 2006). Increases in   exports are likely to occur as well, since provinces like Quebec, BC and Mani-  toba rely heavily on electricity exports for provincial income and have initi-  ated ‘clean energy’ plans with substantial export components.    Climate Change and the Canadian Energy Sector 23  Employment Trends in  Oil and Gas Production  The oil and gas sector constitutes four major types of activities and 37 core   occupations. The four main types of activities are exploration and produc-  tion (E&P); the oil sands; services; and pipelines.  E&P includes exploration and production activities associated with both   conventional oil and gas reserves and unconventional reserves, such as coal-  bed methane, tight gas and shale gas and oil. 40% of the oil and gas sector   workforce is employed in E&P.  The oil sands include producer-operated extraction and the upgrading   of bitumen and employs about 7% of the oil and gas sector’s workforce.  Services include contracted exploration, extraction and production   services to the conventional E&P and oil sands sectors. More specifically,   these services include well services, oilfield construction, production ser-  vices, maintenance and turnaround, transportation services, drilling, and   geophysical services. Workers in services account for about 50% of the oil   and gas labour force.  Pipelines refer to mainline transmission and employment in pipeline   work and accounts for about 3% of the industry’s labour force.  The historical hiring practices in the oil and gas sector resulted in a large-  ly white, male labour force, with an under-representation of immigrants   and women. The increased demand for labour associated with expanded   production in the future, coupled with an aging workforce and natural mor-    24 Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives  tality rates (replacement demand) is forcing the industry to consider work-  ers that had previously had low participation rates in this industry (plmi   2010; Alberta, Employment and Immigration 2007; Jothen & Kunin 2007).   According to 2006 Census figures women account for about 28% of those   working in engineering, trades, and technology in the Canadian labour   force, but they accounted for only about 8% of these positions in the pet-  roleum industry. Immigrants fare slightly better, accounting for 20% of the   comparable labour force, and 9% of the workers in the petroleum industry.   New entrants to the labour force and Aboriginal workers represent a slight-  ly larger share of the petroleum industry’s labour force than they represent   in the comparable total labour force.  Altogether women account for 28% of the employees in the oil and gas   sector, an increase from 25% in 1997. Generally the oil and gas labour force   is characterized as being younger than the rest of the Canadian labour force,   with a greater percentage of workers under 35 than in other sectors of the   economy.  As can be seen from Table 1 union coverage in the entire oil and gas sec-  tor (including all related activities) is low and is declining.

Most of these unionized workers are   in manufacturing and gas distribution. In the manufacturing sector about   32% of the labour force is unionized, a figure that is relatively unchanged   since 1997 and in gas distribution about 45% is unionized, down from 50%   in 1997. The level of unionization is very low in extraction (9.2%), and sup-  port industries (10.2%), but both have experienced about a 2% growth in   unionization over 10 years.19  There is almost no unionization of gas station workers (4.8%) even though   this sector of the industry is a major employer. Of the 74,000 gas station work-  ers, 35% had part time jobs in 2006. Almost 60% were under the age of 35   and average hourly wage rates were only $8.61. A much higher proportion   (42%) were women as well. Employment in this sector has declined slight-  ly in recent years as a result of rationalization of the number of service sta-  tions and a shift to greater customer self-service (Williams 2007, Table 3).    Climate Change and the Canadian Energy Sector 27  Future Employment  Growth in Oil and Gas  The peTroleUm hUman Resources Council of Canada estimates that by   2011 100% of the Canadian labour supply growth will come from immigra-  tion and given the fierce competition that is likely to arise from a tight labour   market in the future, the industry will need to diversity its workforce (Pet-  roleum Labour Market Information 2009, p. 34). Considerable pressure will   come from employee losses due to retirement and natural deaths over the   next 10 years, with the greatest pressure from this in the pipeline sector.  The projected expansion in new demand for workers comes primarily   from the oil sands production, as new operations and production come on   stream, and in the services sector. The main driver in services is the sup-  port that is required by in-situ oil sands extraction. The industry estimates   that the following occupations will need the largest number of additional   workers by 2020 (pmli, p. 9):  • Oil and gas drilling, servicing, and related labourers  • Oil and gas well drillers, servicers, testers, and related workers  • Operators (steam and non-steam)  • Heavy equipment operators, supervisors, oil and gas drilling and   service    28 Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives  • Oil and gas well drilling workers and service operators  • Drilling coordinators/production managers  • Truck drivers; millwright and machinists  • Petroleum engineers  • Geologists and geophysicists.  The employment growth in some occupations will be very large, with   mining engineers demand up 66% over the 2008 workforce. The demand   for almost all core occupations is expected to rise between 30 and 50% over   the same period. Altogether the petroleum industry will need to hire about   105,000 workers between 2010 and 2020 to meet replacement demand and   to support new industry activity (plmi, p. 13). In the short term, that is by   2011 or 2012, labour shortages are expected in five groups of the industry’s   core occupations: engineers, geologists and geophysicists, trades, operators   (steam and non-steam), and services (drilling & geophysical workers, oper-  ators & labourers) (plmi, p. 19).  Most of the labour market growth will occur in provinces that focus on   oil and gas production: British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, New-  FIgure 6 Top 10 Contract Areas (April 2005 to June 2010)  N um  be r   of  W  or ke  rs  0  20,000  40,000  60,000  80,000  100,000  120,000  2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 2016 2018 2020  Oil Sands  E&P  Services  Pipeline  Source PLMI 2009, p. 8    Climate Change and the Canadian Energy Sector 29  foundland and Labrador, and Nova Scotia (plmi, p. 17). The industries that   have experienced serious economic stress and restructuring in recent years,   such as forestry, pulp and paper, sawmills, and lumber manufacturing in-  dustries, are likely to be the source of potential workers, as will industries   that compete for workers with technical skills, such as chemical manufac-  turing and mining.    30 Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives  Employment Trends  in Electricity  as noTed earlier, just over 100,000 people work in the electricity in-  dustry in Canada.20 The main demand for future employment in this sector   will come from retirements, which are expected to proceed at about 5% per   year. The industry itself is less certain about labour needs for the future than   is the petroleum sector, so presents its labour needs in both low and high   growth scenarios. In the low-growth labour scenario, the supply-demand   gaps in the short term (by 2012) are likely to be in the trades and other non-  support positions (2,355) and for engineers (679). In the high growth scenar-  io the supply-demand gaps will be more significant at 3,466 for trades and   other non-support positions and 1,189 for engineers (esc 2008, p. 97–98).   However, the industry is careful to note that this is a ‘hypothetical’ gap and   that employers will likely have access to employment pools, such as con-  tractors that act as a ‘contingent workforce’ for the electricity industry, to   meet labour needs.  Due to the existence of large, relatively stable employers in the electri-  city sector, employment patterns are somewhat different from the oil and   gas industries (with the possible exception of natural gas distribution util-  ities and oil refineries).  In general the electricity sector workforce is highly educated, predomin-  antly working in full-time permanent positions, well paid, working in large   organizations, and has workers who are more likely to be represented by     Climate Change and the Canadian Energy Sector 31  trade unions than other workers in Canada. A large proportion of workers in   this sector (76%) have a post-secondary credential, compared with 57% for   all workers in Canada. Earnings in the sector are 52% above the average in   Canada. Two-thirds of workers are employed at locations with 100 or more   employees, and 70% of all workers in the industry are employed in Ontario   and Quebec (esc 2007, p. 12–19). A high proportion of the workers in this in-  dustry, 73%, are covered by collective agreements, compared with 32% for   all workers in Canada. But there are variations in union coverage by region   with the low being in Alberta (50%) to a high in Manitoba (83%) (Ibid, p. 18).  Occupations are dominated by the trades, transport, and equipment   operators group, which account for 35% of workers in the sector. Manage-  ment and administration is also large, accounting for 32% of the total labour   force (Ibid. p. 19). According to the Electricity Sector Council, the 15 key oc-  cupations in the electricity sector are as follows:  • Electrical Power Line & Cable Workers  • Power Systems & Power Station Operators  • Electrical & Electronics Engineers  FIgure 7 Employment Trends in the Electricity Sector in Canada (# of Employees)  0  20,000  40,000  60,000  80,000  100,000  120,000  1993 1997 2003 2007  Source Chart created from ESC, 2008, p. 33, based on Statistics Canada, Labour Force Survey, 2007    32 Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives  The electricity workforce is not one characterized by diversity, since it   employs fewer women and immigrants than are represented in the Can-  adian workforce. In general it is largely white, male and older than average.   As can be seen from Table 2, women constitute only 25% of total employ-  ment in the electricity sector, considerably less than female representation   in the workforce, and most of the women in electricity are employed in trad-  itional female administrative occupations within the sector. The sector em-  ploys about the same proportion of Aboriginal persons and those from vis-  ible minorities as are represented among the employed in Canada, although   it hires a considerably smaller proportion of immigrants than are repre-  sented in the workforce. The aging of the electricity sector workforce pre-  sents the largest challenge for recruitment in the near future. 74% of the   electricity sector’s workforce is over the age of 40 and only 11% is between   the ages of 25 and 40. The Canadian Electricity Association projects that be-  tween 2007 and 2012 a total of 28% of the sector’s workforce will have re-  tired (esc 2008, p. 7).  As the Electricity Council notes, workers in this sector are unlike workers   in other industries in that in addition to being largely male and older than   the average Canadian workers, they also are more likely to be trade union   members with considerably better wages and working conditions than the   average worker (Ibid, p. 21; cea 2004, p. 12). There are several reasons for   this. Canada’s major electrical utilities are in the public sector where the rate   of unionization is much higher than in private industry. Most workers in the   sector are employed by large utilities, and large employers with stable em-  ployment patterns also tend to be more highly unionized. In addition, a sig-  nificant proportion of the workers in the electricity sector are skilled trades.

The future labour needs in the electricity sector will be fairly consist-  ent with past requirements for labour. As in most areas in the energy sec-  tor, specific types of occupations are in demand. ‘Target occupations’ are   as follows:  • Power plant operators  • Power system operators and electricians  • Engineers: electrical and electronics, mechanical, civil  • Stationary/substation engineers and auxiliary equipment operators  • Electrical and electronics engineering technologists and technicians  • Construction millwrights and industrial mechanics  • Utilities managers  • Contractors and supervisors  • Accountants  • Electrical power line and cable worker    Climate Change and the Canadian Energy Sector 35  Labour Needs in  Renewable Sectors  iT is diFFicUlT to get a clear picture of the possibilities for ‘green jobs’   in the energy sector in Canada for several reasons. First, there is no clear,   widely accepted, definition of what constitutes a ‘green’ job (Global Advan-  tage Consulting 2009; Bezdek 2009; BlueGreen Alliance 2009). This issue   is very important for understanding the nature of job growth in the energy   sector. Second, there is a tendency to assume that the kinds of job creation   that has occurred in other countries with the introduction of green technol-  ogy could be transferred to Canada. And third, there is a tendency for po-  tential ‘green’ projects to over-estimate the total number of jobs that will be   created with each project. Too often temporary construction, or assembly,   jobs are treated as if they constitute permanent employment.  No standard classification exists for ‘green’ industries or ‘green’ occupa-  tions. Green jobs are defined in a number of different ways, ranging for any   job associated with the environment, to jobs dealing specifically with renew-  able energy. Sometimes a more strict definition is used that defines a green   job as something that itself is not environmentally damaging (Renner 2008).  In Canada the most complete accounting of environmental employ-  ment is in the Profile of Canadian Environmental Employment 2007. This re-  port was funded by the Government of Canada’s Sector Council Program   and produced by Eco Canada. Its definition of environmental employment   includes individuals who work in sectors of the economy related to three     36 Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives  main areas: 1) environmental protection (air quality, water quality, land   quality, waste management, restoration and reclamation, human and en-  vironmental health and safety, environmental protection management); 2)   conservation and preservation of natural resources (fisheries and wildlife,   forestry, agriculture, mining, energy, parks and natural reserves, natural re-  sources management), and 3) environmental sustainability (education, re-  search and development, policy and legislation, communications and policy   awareness, management for sustainable development) (eco Canada 2007,   p. 5). This is a definition that encompasses a very broad range of jobs, even   those in environmentally damaging sectors (such as the tar sands), as long   as it relates in some way to something as nebulous as ‘policy awareness’   about the attempts to clean up the environment. This means that a com-  pany in the tar sands that employs someone in advertising to publicize its   new environmental contributions in tree planting would be counted as an   ‘environmental worker.’21  According to this report, about 3.2% of the Canadian workforce (530,414)   is engaged in either full or part-time environment related work. The cat-  egories of this work are: trades and technology occupations (50%), man-  agement jobs (31%), administrative jobs (11%), and sales and service jobs   (8%). (Ibid, p. 8). The report does not specifically look at the energy sector,   but does list mining and oil and gas extraction as an industry group. Ac-  cording to the report, 23% of the establishments have at least one environ-  mental worker (Ibid, p. 18).22 It also says that the mining, oil and gas sec-  tor is expected to have the highest growth in environmental employment,   at 2.6% per year (Ibid, p. 24).  The most recent in-depth look at the employment effects of investment   in the electricity sector was produced to examine the effects of the Ontario   Government’s Green Energy and Green Economy Act. This research, Build-  ing the Green Economy was sponsored by several environmental groups and   specifically examines what level of investment would be necessary to meet   the Ontario government’s goal of creating 50,000 new green jobs. It also   examines the types of jobs that are likely to be created (Pollin and Garrett-  Peltier 2009). This report based its predictions on two levels of investment,   one which is relatively modest ($18.6b over 10 years) would produce about   35,000 jobs per year, and the other on an expanded program ($47.1b over 10   years) would produce about 90,000 jobs per year. These jobs include direct   jobs in the targeted green activities, indirect jobs associated with supply-  ing goods and services to the targeted green industries, and induced effects,   which counts the multiplier effects of the direct and indirect employment on     Climate Change and the Canadian Energy Sector 37  the rest of the economy (Ibid, p. 6). The report makes it very clear that the   35,000 or 90,000 jobs created each year cannot be aggregated for a 10 year   period. This is because these jobs are largely temporary jobs related to con-  struction, including both trades and the service activities. So, while 35,000   jobs may be created each year, 50,000 jobs may not be created in 10 years.  The more the overall level of activity is locally based, as will certainly be   the case with construction, but may not be the case with manufacturing or   engineering services, the higher will be the employment effect. The study   is careful to point out the vast majority of jobs that will be created would be   in the same areas of employment where people already work (Ibid, p. 22–  23). These jobs would include construction labourers, sheet metal workers,   financial auditors, engineers, concrete-forming operators, secretaries, ac-  counts, building inspectors, and research scientists. Most of these jobs pay   over $20 per hour. The jobs paying less than $20 per hour are most likely to   be in construction and manufacturing.  A Canadian-wide estimate for employment in renewable electricity de-  velopment was provided earlier in the 21st century by a report of the Clean   Air Renewable Energy Coalition. According to this report, renewable energy   generation employs on average six people per 10 MW of capacity. It also es-  timated that increasing the capacity by 35,600 MW by 2020 would create be-  tween 12,700 and 26,900 jobs. The major assumption behind the estimates   is that all parts manufacturing, development, and construction would be   filled domestically. Of the four largest contributors to potential renewable   electricity generation (offshore wind, small hydro, biomass, and offshore   wind) the small hydro (or run-of-river) was predicted to be the most labour   intensive per MW for pre-operational work, while biomass would be the   most labour intensive in the operational phase (Clean Air Renewable Energy   Coalition, nd.).  The estimate of job creation by the renewable industry itself is consider-  ably higher than those cited above. Some of the estimates need to be treat-  ed with scepticism. For example, in BC the Sustainable Energy Association   claims that the province has the potential to generate 84,250 gwh of sus-  tainable, renewable energy. This would create over 400,000 jobs over the   next 30 years (BC Sustainable Energy Association 2005). This seems to in-  clude direct, indirect and multiplier effect job creation, but even that would   not explain how BC renewable energy creation in the electricity sector could   create more jobs than exist in the entire energy sector in Canada at the mo-  ment. It is very unusual for any promise of job creation in the energy sector   to be monitored to compare the promise with what actually happens. One     38 Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives  study that did examine this (although not in the renewable sector) confirms   that the anticipated job creation was vastly exaggerated and even with a   long-term approach to job creation it could have been anticipated that the   promised level would not occur (Gunton 2003).23 The accounts of possible   jobs to be created by the associations of renewable energy producers should,   therefore, be treated with considerable caution24.  Wind  As noted earlier, wind energy is experiencing the largest growth among the   renewable sector. The neb estimates that it will form 10% of installed cap-  acity by 2020, although this could be difficult to achieve, considering that it   provides about 1% of capacity in 2010 (neb 2009, p. X). Employment in this   sector, while very small, has grown rapidly from 1,000 in 2004 to over 4,000   in 2010. The government estimates that it will be 13,000 by 2012 (www.ic.gc.  ca/eic/site/wei-iee.nsf/eng/00169.html). Over 430 private companies who   are heavily subsidized by utilities and governments undertake all activity   in this sector. Most of this production relates to project development, pro-  ject operation and independent power generation. Only 16% of the activity   is associated with manufacturing. The manufacturing firms make wind-re-  lated components such as rotor blades, control systems, turbines, invert-  ers, nacelles, towers and meteorological towers.25  The government and the industry see the wind sector as having a great   potential for generating energy in the future. If this does occur, its primary   job potential would be in the construction stage, but even here the num-  bers will be fairly small in comparison with employment in the rest of the   energy sector. It should be noted, however, that wind generates more jobs   per megawatt hour than coal, gas, and nuclear industries (Ayee et al 2009;   Harding; Kammen et al, 2006). If a substantial manufacturing sector were   to develop, much greater job creation could be associated with the pub-  lic investments in this form of renewable energy. Labour shortages exist in   jobs related to operations and maintenance for wind turbines throughout   North America and Europe (sQwenergy 2008; European Wind Energy As-  sociation (ewea) January 2009, p. 10–11). These are specialist jobs that re-  quire training, but again, they do not constitute a large number (Industry   Canada, Wind Energy).    Climate Change and the Canadian Energy Sector 39  Solar  The Canadian Solar Industries Association conducted a survey of employ-  ers in the industry with esc and estimates a total labour force of 1,524 full-  time job equivalents existed in 2008, but expected this labour force to grow   over 100% by 2011 to 3,069. This dramatic increase is based on the belief   that environmentally friendly green technologies will lead to future econom-  ic growth. The jobs expected to have the highest growth rates in the solar   industries include project management (178% growth), installation (146%   growth), sales (120% growth), and manufacturing (107% growth). The ma-  jor constraint the industry sees to reaching these levels of growth relate   to labour shortages (esc 2008). Solar thermal refers to energy that is har-  nessed for heat and photovoltaics converts solar energy directly into elec-  tricity. The majority of solar manufacturing jobs in Canada are concentrat-  ed in five firms whose products are primarily for export. According to one   report, these firms are leading firms, internationally, but there is little Can-  adian demand for their products (McMonagle 2005, p. 2).  Biomass  The major producers of biomass energy are China, Brazil, U.S. and Ger-  many, and nearly 1.2 million are employed in biomass energy in these four   countries (Ubc 2009). The largest use of biomass energy for electricity is in   countries where labour costs are very low. Of all of the renewable energy   sources, biomass is the most labour intensive during production (after the   construction stage). Since the devastation of BC forests by the pine beetle,   considerable interest has been generated in expanding the biomass indus-  try in that province. Biomass also has government support in Saskatch-  ewan for the production of ethanol. Biomass currently accounts for 6% of   energy demand in Canada (Natural Resources Canada), however this is not   largely in a ‘green’ form. That is, the burning of wood for fuel is still exten-  sive in Canada. It will take considerable changes in technology to convert   most of this production to a clean, renewable energy source. Clean energy   biomass production employs a very small proportion of the energy sector   labour force and this probably will not change in dramatic ways in the fu-  ture. Estimates of job creation from biomass, based on UK data, indicate that   1.27 employment/years occur per gwh of electricity produced, regardless of   technology or scale of implementation (Thornley et al 2007). This includes   direct employment related to the bioenergy plant, agricultural production     40 Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives  and transportation, the jobs related to development and construction of the   plant, and the indirect effects from upstream manufacturing and the induced   economic effects from increased economic activity. On a more understand-  able level, a very large 25MW plant would create jobs of about 160 full-time   equivalents over the lifetime of the plant, a figure considerably higher than   the 20 people who would be employed at the plant (Ibid, p. 1925).  Other Renewables  The largest employment in the renewable sector is with large hydro projects,   although many environmental groups consider large hydro to be too environ-  mentally damaging to be championed as a new source of renewable power   in the 21st century. New projects are coming forward in this area in prov-  inces that have typically had large hydro as the main supplier for electricity   (such as BC and Quebec). In the large hydro sector the main job creation oc-  curs in the construction stage of the project. Smaller, micro-hydro (or run-  of-river) projects are increasingly gaining popularity among private power   producers and governments. The job creation associated with micro-hydro   is at the construction stage, with almost no permanent direct jobs created.  In Canada there is some small tidal and geo-thermal electricity genera-  tion, but the technology associated with these forms of energy generation   have not advanced to the stage that this type of production is likely to in-  crease rapidly in the near future.    Climate Change and the Canadian Energy Sector 41  The Role of Organized  Labour in the Energy  Sector  in addiTion To examining the pattern of employment in the energy sec-  tor, the question of what role unions have — and will have — is important for   understanding the future of labour in this sector as governments respond   to climate change. The strength of trade unions will determine to what ex-  tent workers will have a voice in shaping labour, environmental and broad-  er economic policies. Will union density increase or decrease, and how will   union membership reflect the increasing diversity of workers in the energy   sector workforce? Will unions be able to develop effective responses to the   numerous challenges their members will face in the coming years resulting   from global warming, or will they be confined simply to reacting defensive-  ly to the priorities of governments and employers?  Unfortunately, these questions are not easy to answer. This is not only   because the characteristics of the industry resulting from climate change in-  itiatives are uncertain. Equally significant is the challenge of obtaining ac-  curate data on union membership in some parts of the energy sector and,   particularly, oil and gas in provinces such as Alberta, which is key to get-  ting a clear picture of the existing role and influence of unions. Unlike most   industries that have relatively stable unions certified to individual employ-  ers, the oil sands are characterized by highly fluctuating employment lev-    42 Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives  els, numerous small, mobile employers and a mix of union recognition sys-  tems that includes the union-based building trades’ approach to defining   union membership and the more conventional employer-based certifica-  tion system that is characteristic of union recognition in other parts of the   economy. Although Statistics Canada’s Labour Force Survey provides some   useful data on union membership in this sector, the data does not fully cap-  ture the complexity of employment practices in what is a somewhat unique   labour relations system. This is compounded by the gaps in the data col-  lection system of the Alberta Labour Relations Board, the body formally re-  sponsible to collect data on collective bargaining and union membership.   The dominant role of Alberta in Canada’s oil and gas industry makes this   gap particularly significant.  What we do know is that union density varies significantly within the   energy sector. Some areas of energy production, such as upstream oil and   gas exploration, particularly in Alberta, are largely unorganized (telephone   interview with Gil McGowan, President, Alberta Federation of Labour, July   20, 2010). In contrast, others, such as electrical utilities are highly union-  ized, notably in provinces with major publicly owned utilities such as Que-  bec, British Columbia and Manitoba. Unlike oil and gas development, the   electricity sector is generally characterized by relatively stable employment   patterns and well established union representation. But even within these   two broad sectors there are significant variations. Oil refineries tend to be   highly unionized, while private renewable electricity projects such as run   of river hydro facilities and wind farms tend to be poorly organized.    Climate Change and the Canadian Energy Sector 43  Trade Unions in  Oil and Gas  as noTed earlier, union membership is generally quite low in the oil   and gas sector. The notable exceptions are maintenance of gas pipelines,   gas distribution utilities and oil refineries across the country and offshore   oil platforms on the East Coast. There are a variety of reasons for this. Em-  ployers in the oil and gas industry have strongly resisted unionization, par-  ticularly in the key province of Alberta, but also in BC and, increasingly, in   Saskatchewan. As George Bain and other industrial relations theorists have   noted, the willingness of employers to accept unions is a major factor de-  termining workers’ ability to organize successfully (Bain, 1970). According   to Gil McGowan, President of the Alberta Federation of Labour, provincial   labour legislation in his province imposes major barriers to unionization,   resulting in low union density compared with other provinces (McGowan   op. cit. July 20, 2010).  Legislative constraints on unionization are exacerbated by the way work   is organized. Exploration and drilling are characterized by numerous small-  scale operators. Small employers tend to be hard to unionize in all sec-  tors of the economy, but the highly dispersed — and mobile — character of   these operations makes organizing even more difficult. Rapid labour turn-  over also makes organizing and servicing members a major challenge for   most unions. Even when certified to represent a group of workers, unions   can find it difficult to maintain their certifications, as high turnover gives     44 Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives  employers the opportunity to screen out new applicants who are support-  ive of union membership.  Much of the oil and gas industry is characterized by sub-contracting, a   practice that results in small employers offering short term, insecure jobs.   According to Wayne Peppard, of the BC and Yukon Building Trades Coun-  cil, approximately 90% of the contractors in the construction industry are   small businesses. They are highly mobile, with the capacity to hire and fire   workers at very short notice (interview with Wayne Peppard, BC and Yukon   Territory Building and Construction Trades Council, Jan. 7, 2011). It is nor-  mally more difficult to organize workers whose perception is that their em-  ployment is essentially temporary.  In recent years, the oil and gas sector has witnessed significant employ-  ment instability. Sharp fluctuations in oil prices, as well as major internation-  al economic developments, have resulted in very large changes in invest-  ment levels within remarkably short time frames. The 2008 downturn, for   example, resulted in widespread lay-offs, with many workers leaving the   province to return to their former homes, either in other provinces or abroad.   More recently, this has been followed by a gradual return to pre-recession   employment levels with employers again reaching out to recruit national-  ly and internationally to meet anticipated labour requirements and hedge   against future labour shortages. Alberta’s boom and bust employment pat-  tern has resulted in a transitory workforce — yet another factor negatively   affecting union organizing.  Nevertheless, unions have maintained representation rights with a few   of the larger employers operating major extraction facilities. The Communi-  cations, Energy and Paper Workers of Canada (cep) represents about 2,400   workers in the oil sands plant at Suncor. Although not customarily thought   of as a building trades union, it also represents a smaller number of work-  ers in the construction of oil and gas extraction facilities in Alberta. How-  ever, due to the need for specialized skills, members of the traditional build-  ing trades unions have also been employed in some of these projects. The   cep also represents a total of about 600 workers at the Hibernia and Terra   Nova projects in Newfoundland and Labrador (email correspondence, Kei-  th Newman, Research Director, cep, July 9, 2010). The Christian Labour As-  sociation of Canada (clac) represents approximately 6,000 workers at the   Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (cnl) $7 billion Horizon facility north of   Fort McMurray. However, these are the exceptions. In the sector as a whole,   most work is done by unorganized workers.    Climate Change and the Canadian Energy Sector 45  Because construction is such a major component of employment in   the oil and gas industry, the building trades are also major union players   in the sector. This reflects the fact that the members of the building trades   unions have skills employers need and which they cannot readily access   by recruiting elsewhere in Canada, or internationally. Since the construc-  tion unions still play a major role in apprenticeship and training, employ-  ers are dependent, to some degree, on the role of unions in mentoring skills   development. Consequently, construction contractors and sub-contract-  ors in the oil patch have been willing to hire union members and negotiate   agreements with their unions to ensure that their projects are properly built.  On its web site, the Building Trades of Alberta, which includes 16 con-  struction unions, states that its affiliates represent a total of 60,000 union-  ized construction workers in the province. Separate construction union   density figures for the oil and gas sector are not readily available, and will   fluctuate significantly from year to year for reasons discussed elsewhere in   this study.26 In general the trade union density of construction work in the   oil and gas sector could be as high as 20%, with major variations among the   individual building trades unions (National Post, 2007).27  Union recognition in the construction industry is different from that of   most other areas of employment, a fact that is reflected in provincial labour   codes in most provinces having a separate section, or a separate act, devot-  ed specifically to construction. This is because union membership is con-  trolled by the unions and is not contingent on certification by any specific   employer. Union members are normally dispatched to employers via union   hiring halls and return to the hall once a specific project has been complet-  ed. Even if they are employed directly by companies, rather than through   the hiring hall, they can — and often do — maintain their membership in   the union. As a result, they may work side by side with non-union workers   in the same trade on the same worksite for the duration of a construction   project. The mix of union and non-union workers on projects is a common   feature of such projects. However, building trades members may also seek   formal union recognition from their employer once a sufficient proportion   of union members from their trade are active on a worksite. In some cases,   the building trades union itself may negotiate a company-wide agreement   that covers all its trades members working for a specific firm, regardless of   the project on which they happen to be employed.  While each building trades union may negotiate recognition for its mem-  bers on an individual worksite, or with individual employers across the sec-  tor, this does not necessarily mean that all workers on a project are union-    46 Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives  ized. Commonly, a project may have a mix of unionized skilled trades and   unorganized labourers, general workers and support staff. Unions such as   the Plumbers and Pipefitters, International Brotherhood of Electrical Work-  ers, Operating Engineers, Ironworkers and United Brotherhood of Carpen-  ters have been successful in gaining recognition on larger, more stable pro-  jects. The shortage of skilled workers has reinforced their ability to negotiate   with employers.28 At the same time, as the data on union density presented   earlier indicate, it is important not to exaggerate the proportion of union-  ized construction workers active in the oil and gas sector. Union influence   in construction has been in decline for some years. The building trades have   been squeezed entirely out of residential construction in Alberta. They now   represent less than one third of commercial construction — and only on ma-  jor projects. Most of their unionized work that they do have is now on large   industrial projects, primarily in the oil patch.  As noted, one factor that has enabled some of the trades to maintain a   significant foothold in the industry is that they still play a role in apprentice-  ship and training. Many employers remain dependent, to some degree, on   the contribution of unions in facilitating skills development. However, with   declining union density, most of the building trades are no longer able to   guarantee that their apprentices will obtain sufficient work to complete their   training and obtain certification. One of the exceptions is the Ironworkers’   Union which has maintained control over apprenticeship within its trade.   It takes responsibility for ensuring that its apprentices are able to complete   their training and thus ensures that the trade itself remains highly union-  ized. The UA, which represents plumbers and pipe fitters, also exercises   significant control over the 5 year apprenticeships of its members. Accord-  ing to John Telford, Canadian Director of the 50,000 member United Asso-  ciation of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipefitting In-  dustry of the United States and Canada (UA), the union itself spends many   thousands of dollars to train each of its apprentices (Telephone interview,   Jan 11, 2011). As a result of this mentoring arrangement, on completion of   their apprenticeships, workers tend to remain with the union.  Union membership in the traditional building trades unions has also   been affected by the growing capacity of major, predominantly non-union,   construction firms such as Ledcor, to handle even the very largest projects.   In the past, the non-union oil and gas construction sector was limited to   smaller jobs. But now non-union firms are capable of bidding on the largest   as well, giving the oil and gas industry the option of selecting construction   contractors that do not recognize unions. In addition, clac has moved into     Climate Change and the Canadian Energy Sector 47  the training business in a major way, setting up its own apprenticeship pro-  grams covering trades such as operating engineers, teamsters and plumbers   and pipefitters. Increasingly, it is able to provide qualified members to com-  panies that do not wish to recognize the traditional building trades unions   and to negotiate agreements that exclude building trades’ members that   are not members of clac.29  Jurisdictional disputes among the various unions representing workers   in the oil sector have also affected union strength. There have been a number   of conflicts over turf between industrial unions affiliated to the clc, such as   the cep and the international building trades. The building trades unions   view the expansion of the cep into construction as a negative development.   They see cep as an industrial union, not a construction union. For its part,   the cep believes it can do a better job of organizing and representing work-  ers at several of the larger facilities. In its view, it is better that these work-  ers be organized with an industrial union than not organized at all.  But arguably the main source of conflict within the labour movement is   between unions in the more established union federations and clac. Both   the international building trades and the cep, which is affiliated to the Can-  adian Labour Congress, are very critical of clac’s expansion in the sector.   They question how effectively it represents its members and whether it is   too friendly with the employers and the Alberta government. They are par-  ticularly critical of the way in which clac gained union recognition for the   6,000 workers at the cnl Horizon upgrader facility. They believe that cnl   chose to recognize clac as the exclusive bargaining agent for workers at the   facility to prevent other unions from organizing it. The Alberta Federation of   Labour notes that this wall-to-wall agreement, which includes all workers   below management on the site, was reached after the company persuaded   the Alberta government to invoke Division 8, a rarely used provision of the   Alberta Labour Relations Code to facilitate a project wide certification for   clac (National Post, 2007). The established unions also believe that the way   this was done effectively denied workers on the site the option of choosing   a different union to represent them. These internal conflicts, both among   the established unions and between them and clac, make it much more   difficult for labour to speak with a unified voice on questions affecting cli-  mate change and the pace of energy development.  Unions also confront another challenge in the oil and gas sector: how   to accommodate the increasing numbers of temporary foreign workers. No   one knows for sure the size of this temporary foreign labour force in the oil   and gas sector in Alberta, but it is widely recognized as one that is growing     48 Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives  rapidly. Responding to pressure from employers complaining of worker   shortages, the Federal and Alberta governments have greatly expanded this   source of labour in recent years (Sanborn, 2010). In 2009 the Federal Gov-  ernment allowed 178,640 workers to enter Canada under the Temporary For-  eign Worker Program. Alberta employers have recruited a disproportionate   number of these temporary workers. The Alberta Federation of Labour has   noted that by 2009 the number working in the province had reached 65,748.   This represented a fourfold increase in five years (Alberta Federation of   Labour, 2010). There are now more workers on temporary work permits com-  ing to Alberta each year than landed immigrants.  Although many of these workers end up performing relatively low wage,   service sector jobs in hotels, restaurants, retail outlets and so forth, in other   parts of Alberta’s economy, a significant number are now working in the   tar sands, as labourers, cleaners, cooks and truck drivers, as well as some   skilled trades (de Guerre).30 While noting that the absolute numbers of work-  ers entering the construction industry was low, compared with other sec-  tors of the economy, the Construction Sector Council pointed out that the   exception was Alberta. “Labour Market Opinion (lmo) applications for 2006   and 2007 show a clear trend of increasing use of the TFw program. Alberta   FIgure 9 Alberta: New Permanent Residents vs. New Temporary Foreign Workers  0  5,000  10,000  15,000  20,000  25,000  30,000  35,000  40,000  2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008  Permanent Residents Temporary Foreign Workers  Source Alberta Federation of Labour “Report on Temporary Foreign Workers in Alberta” Dec. 16, 2010, p. 13    Climate Change and the Canadian Energy Sector 49  shows dramatic and exponential growth” (Construction Sector Council 2007,   p. 5). Since this was written the number of temporary workers entering Al-  berta has increased substantially. According to Alberta Construction Maga-  zine, Canadian Natural Resources $9.3 billion Horizon Oil Sands Upgrader   Project recruited 80% of its workers from outside Alberta, most from other   parts of Canada but a significant number from the U.S. and abroad (Alberta   Construction Magazine, 2008). This figure seems a bit high, and no source   for the number is given, but it does underscore that companies are actively   recruiting outside the province.  The terms under which employers are able to bring in foreign workers   severely limit their ability to question their working conditions, pay or liv-  ing arrangements. Unions and human rights organizations have been very   critical of the labour practices of employers and also the labour contractors   involved in bringing temporary workers to Canada. The Alberta Federation   of Labour (aFl) has questioned the exorbitant fees workers pay to brokers,   the misleading job advertisements used to recruit them, the sub-standard   accommodation often provided and the racism that is experienced by many   of these workers (Alberta Federation of Labour, 2010).  Given the tenuous nature of their immigration status, their dependency   on the employers that sponsor them and the ability of these same employers   arbitrarily to have them removed from Canada, these workers face signifi-  cant barriers to joining a union. In addition, many are not fluent in English   while many others work in isolated locations, making contact with unions   difficult. To address the numerous problems facing temporary workers, the   aFl established a temporary foreign worker advocate in 2007.  Since then, the aFl has encouraged workers to contact him for help in   resolving their grievances. The advocate has been flooded with requests for   assistance (Alberta Federation of Labour, 2007; Cryderman, 2008).  What is also significant about this program is that neither the Federal,   nor the Alberta governments has been willing to implement the key pro-  posals by organized labour to protect the rights of these workers. Accord-  ing to Katherine de Guerre of the University of Sussex Centre for Migration   Research, who has done a major study of the temporary foreign worker pro-  gram in the tar sands:  The Government of Alberta and the Government of Canada do not pro-  vide direct compensation to local workers or consult with workers, interest   groups, unions, or the general public regarding their TFW policies. This is an   area where the Government could improve. The strong opposition to the pro-    50 Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives  grammes from Alberta’s unions, which represent a large proportion of work-  ers in Alberta, should be heard in regards to their opinions on these policies   (de Guerre, 2009. p.15).  As noted earlier, the oil industry plans a major expansion of the oil sands   over the next decade — plans which are supported by the recent rise in oil   prices. As part of this expansion it also sees a growing role for temporary   foreign workers in meeting anticipated labour shortages. Consequently,   the terms under which the Federal and Alberta governments recruit foreign   workers for jobs in the oil and gas sector is likely to become a significant   issue in the coming years.  While considerable attention has been focused on the employment im-  pacts of the construction and operation of tar sands facilities, manufactur-  ing employment is also a very significant part of the energy sector, particu-  larly in Alberta. This study does not attempt to assess the overall impact   of the industry on manufacturing in Canada. However, due to the extent   to which Alberta’s manufacturing sector has specialized in producing the   equipment and machinery that the industry requires for its massive invest-  ments, a brief account of this provincial aspect of oil and gas development   is warranted. Oil and gas projects need large quantities of a wide range of   specialized items such as fabricated metals, steel pipe, heavy equipment   and a variety of construction materials. Alberta’s manufacturing sector is   different from that of other provinces in that it has developed primarily in   response to the needs of the energy industry. According to Gil McGowan,   roughly three quarters of manufacturing in Alberta is tied directly to oil and   gas production (McGowan, op. cit. 2010). As a result of the 2008 downturn,   Alberta lost about 20% of its manufacturing jobs (Statistics Canada, 2010b).  Although manufacturing employment in the province has recovered sig-  nificantly over the past two years, one major consequence of the cost cut-  ting triggered by the downturn was that a number of the major oil compan-  ies, such as Imperial Oil, have decided to move some of their manufacturing   contracts offshore. South Korea and China are now emerging as major sup-  pliers of equipment for the industry, including entire production modules   formerly built almost exclusively in Alberta. Now that offshore companies   have gained a foothold in the industry, they have a major incentive to ex-  pand their role as lower cost suppliers. Major energy corporations are in-  creasingly willing to use offshore suppliers as a way of ensuring that they   will not have to pay a price premium for locally produced manufactured   equipment as the current expansion gains steam. This development will     Climate Change and the Canadian Energy Sector 51  not only constrain the recovery of manufacturing employment in the prov-  ince: it will also act to undermine the efforts of unions to recover lost mem-  bers. In addition, some companies are now exploring the feasibility of out-  sourcing a portion of the technical, engineering and administrative jobs to   countries such as India (Vanderclippe 2010).  Another part of the energy sector, pipeline construction, also has a sig-  nificant union presence, but only in the larger projects. Oil and gas needs   to be transported to markets across the continent. According to the Na-  tional Energy Board, which regulates pipeline construction and operation,   $127 billion of oil, gas, and petroleum products were shipped through pipe-  lines in 2008. Operation and maintenance of pipelines cost $4.4 billion that   same year. Consequently, pipeline construction is a very significant com-  ponent of the energy sector. It is also a segment of the industry that spans a   number of provinces, even though the bulk of the oil and much of the nat-  ural gas originates in Alberta.  The principal pipeline construction unions are the Teamsters, Labour-  ers, Operating Engineers and Plumbers and Pipefitters. This specialized   type of construction requires highly skilled workers. Large pipeline pro-  jects are planned such that work proceeds, incrementally, according to a   clearly defined schedule. Instead of hiring local residents for each segment   of the construction, the companies move their workers from town to town   as construction proceeds. Consequently, work crews tend to be very stable   and there is relatively little labour turnover during construction of a pipe-  line. Employers require well-trained, specialized workers who they hire for   the duration of a project.  The specialized nature of the work and the key role that the unions still   play in apprenticeship and training in this energy sub-sector has made it   easier for them to maintain a significant presence in the construction of large   diameter pipelines.31 Over 90% of the Canadian portion of the Alberta Clip-  per pipeline that crosses Saskatchewan and Manitoba on its way to Chica-  go was built with unionized workers by the time of its completion in 2010.   (Telford, op. Cit. 2011). However, construction of smaller lines — normally   pipe of less than 24 inches in diameter — is now overwhelmingly non-union.   While we were unable to find data on the share of all pipeline construction   that is organized, the unions themselves believe that when all sizes of pipe   are taken into account, as much as 90% of this work is now done by non-  union crews. (Telford, op. Cit. 2011).  While Alberta’s tar sands and related pipeline construction are the ma-  jor component of Canada’s oil and gas industry, other sectors of the industry     52 Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives  also merit attention. According to the Canadian Petroleum Products Insti-  tute, Canada currently has 18 major refineries (Canadian Petroleum Prod-  ucts Institute 2011). In contrast to the low rate of unionization in oil and   gas production, oil refining, over 70% of which is carried out in central and   eastern Canada, is relatively highly unionized. The cep represents most   of the unionized workers at the major refineries in Quebec, Ontario, Sas-  katchewan, Alberta, and British Columbia. Workers at the Irving Refinery   in Saint John had been represented by the cep, but the local was decerti-  fied a number of years ago after a bitter strike. The United Steelworkers of   America (Uswa) represents workers at a major refinery at Come by Chance   in Newfoundland and Labrador.  Refinery workers tend to have stable employment, good pay, reason-  able pensions and considerable job security. However, the number of refin-  eries has been declining over the past two decades due to corporate mer-  gers within the industry, a shift to larger, more efficient plants, consolidation   of North American gasoline refining, surplus capacity in Europe (resulting   in refined petroleum products being shipped to North America), and little   growth in demand for gasoline in recent years (personal communication,   Keith Newman, July 7, 2010). Union membership in this sector is likely to   decline gradually as the industry further consolidates in the coming years.  Unions in the natural gas distribution utilities currently represent about   45% of the Canadian workforce in this sector. Workers are represented by a   number of different unions, including the cep, which has members at En-  bridge’s Ontario facilities and SaskEnergy. The Canadian Office and Profes-  sional Employees Union (cope 378) represents workers at Terasen Gas in BC.    Climate Change and the Canadian Energy Sector 53  Unions in the  Electricity Sector  as noTed earlier, union density is quite high in the electricity sector in   Canada. According to a 2004 Canadian Electricity Sector Human Resource   Study, 81.8% of non-salaried electrical utility workers were union members   (Canadian Electricity Association 2004).32 This reflects the generally high-  er level of unionization in Canada’s public sector (as Canada’s major util-  ities are public) and also the size and employment stability that character-  izes large utilities.  The Canadian Union of Public Employees (cUpe) with over 38,000 elec-  trical utility members is the largest union in the sector. It represents over   17,600 trades, technical and administrative workers at Quebec Hydro. The   Ontario Power Workers Union (cUpe Local 1000) represents approximate-  ly 14,400 employees working in the former components of Ontario Hydro.   This includes trades, technicians and other classifications working at nucle-  ar, coal and gas fired power plants, as well as maintaining Ontario’s trans-  mission infrastructure. cUpe also has approximately 2,400 members em-  ployed in local electrical distribution utilities in the province, the largest of   which is Toronto Hydro Local One (Keith Cameron, cUpe Research Officer,   email correspondence, July 9, 2010). cUpe Local 998 represents just over   1,100 clerical and technical workers at Manitoba Hydro.  The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 2034 repre-  sents approximately 2,800 trades and electrical workers at Manitoba Hydro.     54 Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives  ibew Local 258 represents 1,900 trades and electrical workers at BC Hydro   which supplies electricity to 94% of BC’s residents. ibew Local 1615 repre-  sents trades and office workers at Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro Nal-  cor. The ibew also has a number of certifications in smaller private electric-  al utilities in various provinces across Canada such as Fortis in BC, Nova   Scotia Power, New Brunswick Power and a significant number of local elec-  trical distribution utilities, both public and private, in Ontario.  The Canadian Office and Professional Employees Union (cope 378) rep-  resents 2,100 clerical, administrative and technical workers at BC Hydro. It   also represents a small number of workers in similar classifications at pri-  vately owned Fortis BC (Formerly West Kootenay Power). In Saskatchewan,   the Communications, Energy and Paper Workers’ Union of Canada (cep) is   the major union at publicly owned SaskPower for trades, technical and ad-  ministrative workers.  There are also a handful of smaller unions or independent locals repre-  senting workers at various private utility generation facilities or local elec-  trical utilities, such as the Canadian Energy Workers Association (cewa),   which has certifications with various aTco subsidiaries in Alberta.  In the construction of new electricity projects, the pattern of unioniza-  tion varies somewhat depending on whether the owner is public or private,   the region in which construction takes place and the provincial labour rela-  tions regime.33 Large hydro, thermal or nuclear construction projects com-  missioned by publicly owned utilities tend to be highly unionized. Prov-  inces such as Manitoba still maintain the practice of negotiating project   agreements in which all workers on a new power generation facility will be   members of one of the building trades unions. Major new power lines are   generally built by unionized labour, but smaller distribution lines may be   built by both union and non-union workers. Projects commissioned by ma-  jor private utilities have a mix of union and non-union construction work-  ers, depending again on the contractors and sub contractors selected to do   the work. A few of the private ‘green’ electricity projects are built by union-  ized construction trades, notably Operating Engineers, ibew and plumb-  ers and pipefitters, but the overwhelming majority are being built and oper-  ated primarily by unorganized workers with a few unionized skilled trades   brought in to do specialised components of the work.  The level of unionization in the electricity construction sector also var-  ies among provinces. Quebec has the highest rate of construction unioniz-  ation. This is partially due to the higher overall level of support for unions   in the province. Quebec shares with Newfoundland and Labrador the dis-    Climate Change and the Canadian Energy Sector 55  tinction of having the highest rate of unionization in Canada. In construc-  tion, its more supportive labour law (the Act Respecting Labour Relations,   Vocational Training, and Manpower Management in the Construction Indus-  try) facilitates a high level of union membership. It allows workers to select   the union that will represent them in the four main sectors of the industry   through a vote every three years. The legislation also facilitates province   wide agreements in these four sectors. Most major new energy construc-  tion is commissioned by Quebec Hydro, which further reinforces the use of   unionized workers in energy projects in the province.  In Ontario, the picture is more mixed. Major public energy construction   projects including nuclear facilities, natural gas power plants, transmission   infrastructure and some of the larger public hydro facilities tend to be high-  ly unionized. However, the provincial government has a policy of sourcing   much of its future energy requirements from the private sector. This has re-  sulted in a growing number of new private electricity generation facilities.   Construction work on these may be either union or non-union, depending   on size, location and the commissioning firm. In addition, small hydro pro-  jects often require lengthy penstocks to move water to the turbines in the   power plant. Due to the skills required, unionized plumbers and pipefit-  ters do much of this work, even on projects that are built by predominant-  ly non-union contractors.  As with oil and gas, Alberta has the lowest overall rate of unionization   of construction workers in the electrical sector. But, as noted, the high de-  mand for workers with particular skills, such as electricians, plumbers and   pipefitters and boilermakers has meant that employers needing particular   skills have been prepared to hire union members or recognize the unions   to which they belong. However, union representation in the electricity con-  struction sector has been declining in recent years, a trend that parallels   developments in some other parts of the construction industry.  Energy projects have significant upstream impacts resulting from their   need for manufactured goods, heavy equipment and fabricated materials   such as steel. They also create demand in a wide range of other areas of   Canada’s economy. A number of unions in the manufacturing sector, princi-  pally in Ontario and Quebec, have certifications in plants that manufacture   equipment and supplies for the conventional energy sector and, particular-  ly, the expanding tar sands. These include the Canadian Auto Workers, the   United Steel Workers of America (Uswa) and the cep, among others. Similar-  ly, unions represent some of the manufacturing workers employed in plants   that are making renewable energy components. However, as noted earlier,     56 Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives  while this is an important area, it is outside the scope of this study to pro-  vide a detailed breakdown of union representation or the role of unions in   this sector of the economy.    Climate Change and the Canadian Energy Sector 57  Unions, Energy Policy  and Global Warming  iF There is one significant observation about the current role of unions in   the energy sector, it is that they are increasingly marginalized in the public   policy debate, except with respect to a narrow range of collective bargaining   and labour relations matters. In some sectors like construction, they still play   a modest role in shaping government policy on trades training, apprentice-  ship and inter-provincial programs such as the Red Seal certification process.   In the electricity sector, the major unions have been active in campaigning   against deregulation and privatization and, arguably, have slowed this pro-  cess in a number of provinces such as Quebec, Manitoba and BC. But over-  all, governments and employers in the energy sector do not see the labour   movement as having any significant role in shaping energy policy or in de-  veloping responses to global warming.  There are a variety of reasons for the limited role of unions in the policy   debate. The influence of organized labour in Canada has eroded significant-  ly in the past three decades. Increasingly the media and governments sim-  ply ignore what unions say on policy issues. There is no longer even a sin-  gle labour reporter in any major newspaper in English Canada, while labour   reporting in Quebec is far less comprehensive than even a few years ago.   Unions in the energy sector have not been immune from this development.   In addition, declining union density, particularly in some provinces such     58 Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives  as Alberta, has weakened the ability of unions to argue that they speak on   behalf of all workers.  Larger economic trends have also reduced union influence. The triple im-  pact of free trade, deregulation and privatization has weakened union bar-  gaining power in a number of key sectors of the economy. The shift towards   a more service based economy, which is less well organized, coupled with   the decline of some of the most highly unionized sectors of the economy   such as manufacturing, forestry and mining, has also reduced the clout of   the labour movement. And while overall union density has not fallen pre-  cipitately in Canada, compared with a number of other countries in recent   years, the seemingly good retention rate conceals the extent of the decline   in the private sector, where most of the key energy unions have members. 34  Unions are not unaware of these developments. As the cep noted in its   2002 policy statement on energy and the environment:  International treaties to stop climate change, environmental campaigns, and   the forces of economic globalization are each advancing an energy agen-  da in conflict with each other. Yet there is an essential voice largely absent   from these crucial decisions. It is time that governments, companies and   decision makers include and listen to workers, and in particular to energy   workers. There can be no successful, meaningful or viable energy policy for   Canada that does not respect the views and interests of the working people   who produce, distribute and process this country’s energy resources (cep   Policy 917, 2002, p1).35  Energy sector unions are very concerned about the impact of global   warming on the work their members do and on the wider consequences for   the planet, as is illustrated by a point made in the more recent version of   cep Policy 917:  cep members understand the necessity of taking action on climate change,   and they signal through this policy their determination to take on the issue.   We have a positive vision of a sustainable environment and a prosperous   economy that requires a stable energy supply. The energy industries of the   future will be increasingly diversified, renewable and smaller scale. Our   homes, workplaces and transportation systems will be more energy efficient   and technologically advanced. Greenhouse gases produced by non-renew-  able fossil fuels will be reduced, with tremendous implications for workers   and whole regions of Canada. However, in our view, these changes do not   necessarily mean a lesser standard of living or fewer good jobs in energy     Climate Change and the Canadian Energy Sector 59  industries. The key to this positive future is democratic, public control and   regulation of our energy resources and just transition measures to ensure   that today’s working families and communities are included in tomorrow’s   energy industries (cep 2008).  A number of the unions discussed in our report, such as the cep, Uswa,   cUpe, and caw, as well as many of the building trades, are also deeply con-  cerned about the long term future of Canada’s energy sector. They are wor-  ried about how global warming will affect employment levels, incomes, em-  ployment security and the kinds of jobs, skill sets and training workers will   need in the future. They are frustrated that governments do not seem to have   a viable transition strategy to address the fundamental economic changes   that global warming will trigger. In the tar sands, unions are particularly   concerned about the `boom and bust` pattern of development which has   been so disruptive to the employment of their members and the commun-  ities in which their members live.  Unions also believe that much of the potential employment associated   with the oil and gas industry is being lost because the companies are failing   to maximize the value added potential of the resource. For example, meth-  ane is the major component of natural gas. However, it also contains other   fraction products such as ethane which are used in the production of chem-  icals and plastics. These other products can be separated from the methane   and then manufactured in chemical plants. The industry has succeeded in   building new pipelines in recent years that enable it to ship the gas direct-  ly to the U.S. without extracting any of these products. Hence the jobs as-  sociated with this area of production are being transferred out of Canada.   The export of largely unprocessed bitumen has similar consequences. For   this reason, the cep and other energy unions have opposed the expansion   of pipeline capacity for export (cep Policy 917, 2008; Canadian Labour Con-  gress, 2008). Similarly, the outsourcing of manufacturing components for   upgraders and other oil and gas facilities is eliminating significant num-  bers of jobs. More prudent management of the resource, in the view of the   unions, could maintain employment levels without having to continually   raise output and exports. Increasing value added job creation is thus a key   component of a transition strategy advocated by labour. Similarly, a well   thought out labour adjustment program would make it much easier for work-  ers to support a move away from jobs associated with high ghg output to   jobs that are more environmentally sustainable.    60 Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives  At a broader level, Canada’s energy sector unions have been quite critic-  al of the overall direction of government policy — or perhaps more accur-  ately, the abandonment of public policy — in favour of a market based ap-  proach that allows corporations a free hand to shape the country’s energy   future. In the oil and gas sector, they have raised concerns about the un-  critical reliance by both levels of government on the decisions of private in-  vestors, as well as the incremental integration of Canada’s oil and gas sector   into a North American market dominated by the U.S. They have also ques-  tioned the export oriented growth trajectory promoted by the industry, the   negative environmental impacts of the rapid, if erratic, expansion of the   tar sands and the failure of governments to engage in long range planning.   They have been highly critical of policies that are based on further deregu-  lation of the industry. In their view, Canada needs a comprehensive plan   to address global warming that would respect the country’s Kyoto commit-  ments, encourage conservation and incorporate an effective labour transi-  tion strategy (cep Policy 917, 2008).36  Energy sector unions also prompted the clc to develop a comprehen-  sive policy statement to address the future of Canada’s energy development   in the context of global warming (clc 2003). The statement acknowledged   the serious environmental threat Canada now faced and argued that gov-  ernments should take major steps to address this threat in the immediate   future through a ‘just transition’ program. It supported the Canadian gov-  ernment’s decision to endorse the Kyoto Accord but was critical of Canada’s   lack of progress in implementing the Accord’s basic objectives. While recog-  nizing that Canada would continue to need significant energy supplies as a   consequence of its cold climate and the desire of Canadians to maintain a   decent standard of living, it argued that reliance on fossil fuels must be sig-  nificantly reduced and tax breaks for the fossil fuel industries be curtailed.   Consequently, it supported a variety of measures to shift energy production   towards renewables through targeted subsidies, tax measures and slowing   the growth of fossil fuel extraction. It endorsed higher taxes on fossil fuels   to encourage more efficient use of energy. However, it argued that govern-  ments should use the additional revenues to support the transition to sustain-  able, low ghg economy and cushion the impact on low income Canadians.  One of the key planks of the clc policy statement was to challenge the   negative environmental impact of the Canada-U.S. FTa and naFTa. These   agreements locked Canada into an export focused approach to energy de-  velopment. They promoted the rapid expansion of oil and gas production   without regard for Canada’s future requirements. And they exposed Can-    Climate Change and the Canadian Energy Sector 61  adian consumers to unpredictable price changes based on fluctuations in   the U.S. energy market. In the document’s words:  There is an urgent need to re-establish Canadian control over the long-term   future of the energy sector to meet the public interest. This will demand chal-  lenging the energy provisions of naFTa by re-regulating oil and gas exports   through the National Energy Board (neb), and rejecting proposals for fur-  ther ‘deep integration’ of energy on continental lines as well as further do-  mestic deregulation and privatization (clc 2003).  The alternative, according to the clc, was a new national energy plan   that would focus on curbing the growth of fossil fuel production and re-fo-  cusing Canadian production to meet Canada’s needs, rather than exports   to the U.S. market. Complementing a domestically focused energy policy,   Canada should implement a comprehensive just transition program that   would provide financial assistance and retraining to workers displaced as   a result of the shift to a low carbon economy. It should also provide sup-  port for communities negatively affected by this shift, while encouraging   the development, or expansion, of new climate friendly industries. These   various proposals underlined the need for a much stronger government role   in regulating Canada’s energy sector. International market forces would not   address the challenge of global warming: it was essential that governments   provide the needed leadership (clc 2003).  Unions representing workers in Canada’s major public electricity corpor-  ations have been very critical of the incremental privatization and deregula-  tion of Canada’s electricity system, the break-up of integrated utilities such   as Ontario Hydro and the negative impact of other market based reforms   such as those promoted by the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.   They have strongly opposed policies that further integrate Canadian utilities   into the U.S. grid, fearing that this will compromise the ability of Canada to   develop its own approach to energy security. cUpe, ibew, cep and cope,   among others, have attempted to play a role in influencing the policy dir-  ection of provincial governments. Typical of these efforts is a statement in-  cluded in a presentation to Saskatchewan’s Standing Committee on Crowns   and Central Agencies by the cep:  CEP strongly supports public ownership of large scale electricity generating   facilities as well as the power distribution system. Electricity is not a commod-  ity like any other. It is an essential public service. The provision of electricity   should not be left to market forces with their fundamental drive for short term     62 Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives  profit regardless of social cost, environmental impact or worker health and   safety. (Bailey and Sol, 2010, p.8)  cUpe makes similar points in a major research paper analyzing the   problems resulting from the Harris governments deregulation and partial   privatization of Ontario’s electricity system. The paper asserts that it was a   mistake to break up vertically integrated public utilities, such as Ontario’s.   Rather than promoting north-south integration of Canadian and U.S. elec-  tricity systems, it argued that Canada should explore further east-west trans-  mission linkages to improve energy security and maintain domestic con-  trol over the country’s electricity system. It claimed that deregulation and   the introduction of a competitive electricity market had undermined util-  ity conservation programs and called for their reinstatement. It also high-  lighted what the union viewed as the negative impact of naFTa in narrowing   the public policy options of government while facilitating the integration   of Canada’s electricity system into a continental framework dominated by   the U.S. (cUpe 2003).  These policies have been accompanied by specific actions designed   to stop deregulation and preserve public ownership in this sector. For ex-  ample, in 2009, cUpe and other civic unions launched a court challenge to   the decision of the city of Edmonton to privatize the electricity generating   assets of Epcor. In Ontario, the cep and cUpe successfully challenged the   government’s proposed $5.5 billion sale of part of the transmission assets of   Hydro One, forcing it to scrap its plans for the largest ipo in Canadian his-  tory. The court ruling in 2002 directed the government to halt the sale be-  cause it had no legislative authority to do so. In BC, two unions, the Can-  adian Office and Professional Employees (cope) Local 378 and ibew Local   258 have engaged in a decade long fight to prevent the break up and priva-  tization of BC Hydro. They supported a class action lawsuit by BC Citizens   for Public Power to stop the contracting out of the administrative and bill-  ing services of BC Hydro to Accenture. Although the lawsuit was eventually   dropped because the government amended the legislation on which it was   based, the action focused public attention on the government’s efforts to   weaken BC Hydro. cope also financed a major campaign to oppose the in-  cremental privatization of electricity production in BC. It set up a special   website for its Take Back the Power campaign and populated it with cred-  ible, union funded research reports and videos illustrating the negative im-  pacts of private power projects (cope 378, 2011).    Climate Change and the Canadian Energy Sector 63  In recent years, energy sector unions, along with the broader labour   movement, have been pushing for new policies that are explicitly focused   on ‘greening’ the economy, both in terms of a more environmentally respon-  sible approach to energy production and in terms of creating a manufactur-  ing sector with the capacity to provide the products needed in the transition   to such an economy. A number of major unions have passed policy state-  ments and convention resolutions that reflect this approach.37  Unions have also attempted to build bridges with parts of the environ-  mental and social justice movements, taking initiatives to establish a variety   of forums in which labour activists and members of these other organiza-  tions can discuss co-ordinated responses to climate change. One such re-  cent initiative is the Green Energy Network. It is sponsored by the Canadian   Labour Congress, a number of major environmental organizations such as   Greenpeace, the Sierra Club, the David Suzuki Foundation and the Pembi-  na Institute. It also includes a number of leading ngos such as the Coun-  cil of Canadians, the Polaris Institute and Kairos. The goal is to develop a   collaborative process in which the various partners can develop policy re-  sponses to climate change that will incorporate environmental, employment,   training and social justice considerations (Green Economy Network, 2010).  At the provincial level, cope and ibew as well as the BC Federation of   Labour have supported public policy advocacy groups such as BC’s Citizens   for Public Power, which brings together labour, environmental and citizen   representatives. Its focus has been to challenge the provincial government’s   electricity privatization agenda and to work with other organizations to pro-  mote policies that give priority to energy conservation, rather than the ex-  pansion of export led private power development.  The BC Federation of Labour and its major affiliates sponsored a ma-  jor conference in September, 2010 entitled “Jobs, Justice and the Environ-  ment.” It was co-sponsored by the Sierra Club, the Pembina Institute, the   David Suzuki Foundation, Eco Justice and the Canadian Centre for Policy   Alternatives among others. It brought together labour, environment, social   justice and community organizations to build a broader coalition for the   promotion of fundamental policy changes needed to combat the challenge   of global warming in British Columbia. It also invited representatives of the   BlueGreen Alliance in the U.S. to share their experience in coalition work.   Energy sector unions and provincial federations of labour in other prov-  inces have also initiated similar kinds of campaigns.  It would be misleading to argue that there are no tensions between or-  ganized labour and environmental groups. The kinds of changes that global     64 Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives  warming will trigger will also create ‘winners and losers’. While energy sec-  tor unions are supportive of major policy changes they are also concerned   that these changes do not unreasonably or unfairly impact their members.   This is one reason why the question of how to transition to a greener econ-  omy in a manner that shares the burdens fairly is high on the agenda of   many unions. Nor would it be accurate to say that the unions themselves   are in full agreement on the policy changes needed. Union members are   part of the larger society in which they live and work. They are influenced   by the overall climate of public opinion on these issues. They have practical   concerns about their own jobs and their economic futures. To some degree   their opinions reflect the circumstances — and the interests — of the indus-  tries in which they work. While it remains to be seen how unions will meet   these challenges, certainly there is evidence that many unions understand   the seriousness of the climate change issue and are attempting to find a way   to develop effective responses.  In sum, it is premature to speculate on how much influence these vari-  ous union initiatives to address the challenge of climate change may have   on the future direction of Canada’s energy sector. As noted earlier in this   paper, the Federal Government appears intent on a massive expansion of   the tar sands, as well as further integration of Canada’s electricity system   into the U.S. grid. It has pushed this agenda forward through negotiating   a number of new agreements with the U.S. which have set the country on   a trajectory that may be very difficult to change. Whether unions and the   workers they represent will be able to affect this trajectory will depend in   large part on how energy policy unfolds in the coming years and how quick-  ly Canada experiences the impact of global warming.    Climate Change and the Canadian Energy Sector 65  Conclusion  The general assUmpTion that policies that would bring about substan-  tial reductions in carbon emissions would have a negative effect on employ-  ment in the energy industry in Canada is undoubtedly true (Jaccard 2008).   However, Canada is unlike the U.S. and European countries: it is not ex-  periencing reductions in oil and gas production as is occurring elsewhere.   While conventional oil and gas production is declining, as elsewhere, Can-  ada’s production from unconventional sources is expanding. Canada’s use   of electricity is also increasing. Associated with this expanded energy pro-  duction are government policies that encourage the growth of oil and gas   production while doing relatively little to encourage reductions in consump-  tion of either oil and gas or electricity. In the electricity sector a large pro-  portion of generation comes from hydro-based systems with some provinces   also heavily reliant on nuclear energy, both of which are renewable resour-  ces that do not contribute to climate-related emissions.38  Our review of the existing literature on employment in the energy sec-  tor concludes that the kinds of employment demands that have existed will   continue for the foreseeable future. If government introduces substantial   carbon-reduction policies, this may change, but this is not the current tra-  jectory. New production in renewable industries such as wind and solar is   more labor-intensive than in existing electricity production, but constitutes   a very small proportion of the market so far. While these industries are likely   to grow considerably by 2020, their job creation potential is relatively small.    66 Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives  It should be noted that these industries will be competing with existing   generating companies for labour and since this is a sector where wages are   high, the cost of labour may well be a barrier to continued expansion of   these industries. This is because the kinds of jobs needed in the renewable   energy sector are not markedly different from those required in the major   energy sectors. While the labour force of the energy sector has traditionally   been largely male from within Canada, the industry recognizes that labour   shortages may force changes here. In virtually all areas of energy develop-  ment, there are skills shortages and calls for additional training. These   shortages cover a wide range of different occupations, from engineers and   architects to skilled trades, equipment operators, technicians and even con-  struction labourers. Skills shortages also vary, regionally and by energy sec-  tor (Alberta Employment and Immigration 2007; Lorenz 2007; sec 2007b;   sdi 2003). Most of the shortages are for jobs in conventional energy produc-  tion. However, the renewable sector is also experiencing significant short-  ages of qualified personnel (Robitaille & Etheverry 2005; sQwenergy 2008).  Other than large-scale hydro projects where several provincial govern-  ments, such as Quebec, Ontario and Manitoba, have attempted to link some   of the spending with local employment or industrial offsets, public support   for private green energy projects has produced fairly limited job growth   outside direct construction. Even where provinces have attempted to link   ‘green energy’ subsidies to industrial development, their efforts have been   very modest. Since most permanent jobs related to ‘green’ energy are creat-  ed through the manufacturing of green technology, the absence of a policy   to increase domestic use of this technology through Canadian based manu-  facturing means the loss of the employment potential of renewable energy   expansion. Somewhat perversely, governments in Canada now believe that   many of the policy tools associated with activist industrial strategies are   ‘protectionist’. If Canada is to realize the full job creation potential of green   energy development, this view may have to change.    Climate Change and the Canadian Energy Sector 67  Bibliography  Alberta.

The latter issues are also of critical importance in addressing ghg   emissions and climate change, but are outside the scope of this research. The use of energy to   produce oil, gas, coal and other energy products is not the same as the resulting energy output.  3 The terms ‘tar sands’ and ‘oil sands’ refer to the extraction of very heavy oil, bitumen, in Al- berta. The common term used is ‘tar sands,’ although there is an attempt by the industry to shift   the name to ‘oil sands. “Green bitumen” refers to the attempt to achieve emissions reductions   below that of conventional crude oil (McColl 2009).  4 In 1990 the oil and gas and electricity sector contributed about the same proportion of ghg  to the Canadian total.  5 Thus economic downturns in major industries, such as pulp and paper or mining, can have a  very substantial impact on energy use by industrial customers.  6 A significant factor in the future use of coal to generate electricity will be the extent that On- tario is able to implement its commitment to phase out coal fired generation in the coming years   (neb 2009).  7 The nuclear industry defines its energy generation as ‘green’ because nuclear generation of  electricity does not produce ghg emissions. However the industry itself is the primary propon-  ent of defining nuclear energy as ‘green.’ (Timisina et al 2008, pg. 13). Environmentalists tend to   see the possibility of environmental destruction on a massive scale from nuclear accident and   the enormous environmental issues associated with nuclear waste serious problems in classify-  ing nuclear energy as ‘green’ energy (Marshall 2002, p34).  8 The website also acknowledges that it is sometimes necessary to have government interven- tion: “Where necessary, targeted intervention in the market process to achieve specific policy ob-  jectives through regulation or other means: These policy objectives include issues of health and     Climate Change and the Canadian Energy Sector 77  safety (e.g., pipeline regulation) and environmental sustainability”. The government goes on to   note that the Western Accord, the Agreement on Natural Gas Markets and Prices, the Atlantic Ac-  cords and, most significantly, the North American Free Trade Agreement effectively frame its policy   orientation. (http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/eneene/polpol/owevue-eng.php) downloaded June 13, 2010.  9 Clare Demerse of the Pembina Institute believes that federal subsidies to the industry now  amount to approximately $2 billion annually (Demerse, nd).  10 Neither the federal, nor the provincial governments have shown any appetite in recent years  for revisiting the issue of privatizing Petro Canada or establishing a state oil company similar to   what many other countries, such as Norway, have done. The largest oil companies and the lar-  gest reserves throughout the world are currrently owned by nation states (Cohen 2006, p. 14).  11 In this regard it is interesting to compare the approach of Alberta with Norway. While the  timing of their respective production rates varies, both jurisdictions have produced about the   same volume of oil over the past four decades. According to the Sovereign Wealth Fund Insti-  tute, as of December, 2010 Norway has over US$512 billion in its ‘rainy day’ pension fund for fu-  ture generations — a fund built up principally from its oil and gas revenues. (Sovereign Wealth   Fund Institute, 2011). In comparison, Alberta’s Heritage Savings Trust Fund, which was started   in 1976, had accumulated assets of $14.8 billion as of September 30, 2010. (Alberta Heritage Sav-  ings Trust Fund. 2010)  12 Over the last decade various incentive programs have been initiated to promote private sec- tor green energy development. Typically, these programs provide tax abatements, or direct sub-  sides, such as a 1 cent per KWh payment for energy produced from new renewable projects for   a fixed time period. See for example the $1.48 billion ecoEnergy for Renewable Power fund an-  nounced in 2010 by the Federal Government. Information downloaded from nrc web site July   9, 2010.(http://www.ecoaction.gc.ca/ecoenergy-ecoenergie/power-electricite/index-eng.cfm).  13 This number does not include estimates of the employment generated in the upstream trans- portation, manufacturing, services, government and other economic sectors.  14 Figures for pipeline transportation are not available after 2001, which explains the appear- ance of a decline in employment in that sector.  15 Shale gas is produced from a sedentary rock formation composed of clay minerals and other  minerals. Until recently, it was difficult to extract natural gas from such formations. However, a   new process, known as hydrolic fracturing, or ‘fracking,’ now enables gas producers to open up   the seams in the clay, allowing the gas to escape. As a result, large new pools of natural gas can   be commercially exploited. The process remains controversial due to its potential environment-  al impacts on water supplies. Tight gas is gas that is difficult to extract from the sand in which   is found with conventional technologies. This can be due to low pressure or low permeability of   the sand or rock formation in which it is found. For a discussion of recent advances in extracting   shale and tight gas, see: National Petroleum Council, “Topic Paper #29: Unconventional Gas”   Washington: July 18, 2007.  16 Synthetic and bitumen production has increased by 387% since 1990.  17 Canada is the third largest per person consumer in the world, after two other cold countries  whose electricity largely comes from hydro: Iceland and Norway.  18 The decrease in demand in 2009 relate to the economic crisis that began in 2008, however  the long-term trajectory is for changes in demand to rise faster than the changes in population.  19 The last section of this paper provides an analysis of issues facing trade unions in the energy  sector.    78 Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives  20 The estimates of the size of the electricity labour force range considerably, from the Electri- city Industry Survey Publication (2005) of 76,498, to the Labour Force Survey of 105,500 (Electri-  city Sector Council 2008, p. 31).  21 See, for example, the full-page ad in the Globe and Mail, May 31, 2010 which is a message from  Canada’s Oil Sands Producers. It features Garrett Brown, of ConocoPhillips saying “I Grew up   on a farm. I know what it means to have the land restored.” The ad goes on to say that for years   the petroleum producers have been planting grass and they are now beginning to plant trees, so   that in a few years the forest will be re-established.  22 It is not possible to get information about the electricity sector from the report.  23 This study relates to the Northeast Coal Project and compares pre-project forecasts to post- project outcomes for one of the largest megaprojects ever undertaken in Canada. Less than half   the expected regional employment occurred and the project’s proposal greatly over-estimated   both direct employment and its multiplier effect. The project wound up having a negative effect   on regional development.  24 This is aside from whether the jobs themselves will be good jobs. For a test of assumptions  that green jobs will be good jobs see Mattera 2009.  25 A nacelle is the casing, or housing, for the electrical generator and other related mechanic- al components of a wind turbine.  26 For a detailed estimate of the number of workers from the various trades that are currently  working in Alberta, as well as for estimates of future demand for these trades, see: Construction   Sector Council. “Construction Looking Forward: An Assessment of Construction Labour Markets   from 2010 to 2018 for Alberta.” Ottawa; May, 2010. http://www.csc-ca.org/english/index.html.  27 Given how much of Alberta’s economy is dependent on the energy sector, it is also difficult to  distinguish between construction work done directly for the industry, and work that is being done   as a result of the industry’s demands for various economic inputs needed to support its activities.  28 This also underlines one of the challenges of getting a clear picture of construction union  membership on oil and gas projects. Due to the demand for their skills in other areas of construc-  tion, building trades workers can readily move in and out of the oil and gas sector. Internal union   data on the number of members is often not disaggregated according to the sector in which they   work. Consequently, knowing the number of members of a particular trade who are members of   an individual union local, or the total number in the parent union working in a province does   not necessarily indicate the number active in the oil patch. Conversely, knowing the number of   workers with specific trades qualifications working in the oil and gas sector does not necessar-  ily provide reliable data on the number who are union members. To further complicate matters,   construction contractors may be working in a number of different sectors of the construction in-  dustry, some of which are not oil and gas related. They may move their employees frequently   from sector to sector depending on the contracts on which they have successfully bid and the   skill requirements and timing of the different projects.  29 See, for example, the listing of the trades noted above that are included in clac Local 63`s  collective agreement with Ledcor Utility Infrastructure Inc. for the period 2008 to 2010. This and   similar clac agreements can be found on the Alberta Employment and Immigration website.   http://employment.alberta.ca/apps/cba/search.asp  30 In her paper examining Alberta’s temporary foreign worker recruitment program for the tar  sands, Katherine de Guerre notes that the oil industry still differentiates between recruiting man-  agers who they bring in as landed immigrants and skilled trades and other workers, who normally   enter as temporary foreign workers. The former are permitted to move their families and take up   permanent residency, while the latter often end up living in camps on their own, separated from     Climate Change and the Canadian Energy Sector 79  their families and with no right to remain in Canada unless they continue to work for the same   employer. (de Guerre 2009). For an overview of the principal elements of the temporary foreign   worker program in Alberta, see: Human Resources and Skills Development Canada, Citizenship   and Immigration Canada and Alberta Learning (2008) and Construction Sector Council, (2007)  31 Interestingly, because provinces exercise control over labour relations matters within their  jurisdictions, it has been more difficult for the building trades’ unions in Canada to negotiate   comprehensive project agreements than in the U.S. For example, the recently announced start   to the U.S. leg of TransCanada’s Keystone project was accompanied by a news release that the   four major unions involved in its construction will represent all the workers in their respective   trades throughout the project’s construction across a number of U.S. states. This is because U.S.   federal labour legislation permits this type of agreement.  32 The percentage cited only includes hourly workers such as skilled trades classifications (line- workers, electricians, etc.), maintenance workers, labourers, vehicle drivers and other manual   workers. As noted earlier in this paper, about 73% of all workers in this sector are represented   by trade unions.  33 One of the challenges in obtaining data on the number of union members in the energy sec- tor is that unions such as the ibew have many locals that include both energy and non energy   workers. As much of their work is project based, members may work on an energy project one   year and an industrial or commercial project the following year. Also many employers in the con-  struction sector work on a variety of different types of construction rather than focusing exclu-  sively on energy projects. Project based work also results in wide fluctuations in the number of   worker involved in energy construction from one year to the next. These and other factors make   data collection a challenge in this part of the energy sector.  34 Interestingly, union density has not fallen very much during the past decade. According to  Statistics Canada, union density in 2010 is 29.6%, a marginal decline from 32.2% a decade earli-  er. However union coverage is considerably below the 1981 figure of 38%.  35 Both the 2002 and the 2008 revised cep 917 policy statements present very well thought out  analyses of the seriousness of global warming and the inadequacy of the response of corpora-  tions and governments to it, particularly with respect to meeting Canada’s Koyo commitments.   They lay out a clear policy agenda, both for labour and for governments which focuses on the   need for fundamental changes to how Canada manages its energy sector. As such cep Policy 917   and its 2008 revision are probably the best overall statements of a progressive labour response   to global warming.  36 This policy document strongly criticizes naFTa for locking Canada in to a policy of increas- ing energy exports to the U.S. It argues that the deregulation of prices has eliminated Canada’s   competitive advantage in downstream processing while providing a huge windfall to the oil and   gas companies at the expense of Canadian consumers.  37 See, for example: Strategic Alliance Between Environmental Defence and Uswa. May, 2008  and cep and cUpe policies noted elsewhere in this paper.  38 As has been noted earlier, nuclear energy does have the potential to be extraordinarily dam- aging to the environment and many environmentalists point to other damages that occur through   large-scale hydro development.
