                                           Climate Change Adaptation Plan       Climate Change Adaptation Plan   September 2012    City of Windsor     Climate Change Adaptation Plan 2012     2     Executive Summary   Regardless of the cause, the average temperature in Windsor has increased by almost 1°C since 1940.   Scientists predict that by 2050, the average annual temperature in Ontario will increase by 2.5°C to   3.7°C from the1961-1990 baseline average. This change, along with predictions that the number of   “hot” days (over 30 °C/86 °F) in Windsor could almost quadruple by 2071-2100, is cause for concern.   Heat related illnesses place a strain on our health care services and energy used to cool our buildings is   expensive.  In addition, this shift in the average weather for the region allows for the survival of invasive   species and the expansion or introduction of insect vectors that carry disease.   As air temperature increases, so does the capacity of the air to hold more water. This can lead to more   intense rainfall events, which Windsor has already experienced directly including events in 2007 and   2010 which caused severe flooding. In 2011, Windsor experienced the wettest year on record,   measuring 1,568mm of rain compared to the average annual rainfall of 844mm. Increased temperature   and intense rainfall events are two climate change impacts that have resulted in direct costs to Windsor   residents through basement flooding and heat related illness expenses.   Municipalities have a significant role to play in climate change adaptation as many climate change   impacts will directly affect the services provided by the City of Windsor and our agencies. This plan was   developed through consultation with all City departments and select City agencies.  Each department   was asked to look at all of their potential impacts and determine which impacts would present the most   significant challenges to operations.  Once these impacts were agreed upon, a vulnerability and risk   assessment was completed to further narrow down the potential impacts that pose the greatest risk to   the municipality as a whole.     The focus of this adaptation plan is on the following five potential climate change impacts which were   rated as posing substantial risk and therefore may result in the greatest impact on our municipal   operations:   1. Increase in operating/maintenance demands to deal with climate extremes.   2. Increased chance of flooding to basements, roads and other infrastructure   3. Increase in demand to all areas of Operations when responding to an increase in severe storms   (during and after).   4. Increase in public health risks due to extreme heat.   5. Implementation of development policies which were created in the absence of Climate Change   considerations, which may increase our vulnerability.   The list below summarizes the proposed short-term adaptation actions suggested to increase Windsor’s   resiliency to weather extremes. Many of these short-term actions build on existing programs in   recognized areas of vulnerability.  Other adaptation options may be fairly new to the City of Windsor,   however there is a growing level of expertise available amongst other municipalities.

The   following strategies should be undertaken to ensure that the City of Windsor continues to be a leader on   adaptation well into the future:   1. Incorporate climate change adaptation into city policies and high level plans;   2. Create internal mechanisms to ‘ask the climate question’ for all new major infrastructure   projects;   3. Monitor climate change, evaluate the effectiveness of adaptation strategies and adjust as   needed (adaptive management);   4. Use best available science to analyze how the climate is changing locally and how this may   impact the community;   5. Routinely review the City of Windsor’s vulnerability to climate change;   6. Continuously conduct risk assessments to identify priority impacts requiring adaptation actions,    7. Engage the public, business and other stakeholder groups.   The actions taken today by the City of Windsor to proactively adapt to the changing climate will enhance   community resilience to climate change while reducing the human and economic costs of climate-  related impacts. Adaptation actions can often lead to great cost savings as intense storm events and   extreme heat can result in devastating expenses to repair infrastructure, basement flooding and   minimize health care costs.

The City of Windsor is already experiencing the effects of climate change.  We’ve seen   more intense summer storms than in previous years which have contributed to increased basement   flooding.  The summer of 2010 was reported as the second hottest on record, only 0.3⁰C degrees cooler   than the summer of 2005, the hottest on record. Warming of the Great Lakes has contributed to major   ecosystem impacts such as extensive algae growth, the invasion of non-native species, pathogen and   water borne diseases and falling lake levelsi. The West Nile virus and the increase in Lyme disease in   Ontario are other consequences of climate changeii.     The climate will continue to change.  Although reducing greenhouse gas emissions is vital to limiting the   rate and amount of change, it cannot prevent climate change from occurring over at least the next   several decadesiii.   As a result, governments and communities must now consider how to adapt to the   unavoidable effects of climate change.  Therefore, in addition to the City of Windsor’s initiatives to   mitigate climate change, it is becoming more evident that the City of Windsor needs to increase the   adaptive capacity of the community.     ICLEI Initiative   ICLEI – Local Governments for Sustainability (Management) Inc., referred to as ICLEI Canada is an   international association of local governments as well as national and regional local government   organizations that have made a commitment to sustainable development.  On November 8th, 2010,   Windsor City Council approved participation in ICLEI’s Climate Change Adaptation Initiative (CR   408/2010). This program provided a straightforward methodology to adaptation planning which   resulted in the creation of this Plan. The initiative will continue to build capacity internally for ongoing   implementation and monitoring of our Plan.    Vision   The overall aim of Windsor’s adaptation strategy is to create a more resilient city to the effects of a   changing climate. A well-adapted city is able to absorb the effects of climate change, such as extreme   summer heat or intense rain events, through the advancement of sustainable policies, infrastructure   investment, and public education. This requires forward thinking and initiative. Being prepared to   handle the climate challenges facing us will be beneficial to our health, our environment and our   economy.            Climate Change Adaptation Plan 2012     6     What is Adaptation?   Adaptation to climate change includes any activity that reduces the negative impact of climate change   while taking advantage of new opportunities that may be presented. This type of action differs from   mitigation as adaptation aims to minimize the actual or expected effects of climate change while   mitigation is action to reduce the sources of anthropogenic greenhouse gases.    Why is Adaptation Required?   The average temperature of the planet has increased by 0.74 °C since 1900.  A similar trend is seen right   here in the City of Windsor.     The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has concluded that the evidence for climate   change is “incontrovertible” and that a large part of the ongoing change is due to human activities,   notably the release of greenhouse gases (GHGs) to the atmosphere.  The Earth’s atmosphere has 38%   more carbon dioxide (CO2) than it had before the beginning of the industrial era i.       GHGs released decades ago are a main contributor to the change in our climate today.  That means that   even if globally, greenhouse gases were eliminated, changes will continue due to what was released in   the past.   Public Safety Canada has been documenting “significant natural disasters” for over a century in the   Canadian Disasters Database. A “significant disaster” is a disaster that meets one or more of the   following criteria:    10 or more people killed    100 or more people affected/injured/infected/evacuated or homeless    An appeal for national/international assistance    Historical significance    Significant damage/interruption of normal processes such that the community affected   cannot recover on its owniv   Figure 1 below clearly shows the increase in “significant natural disasters” occurring across Canada from   1900 to 2011.      Regardless of the cause, changes in weather patterns already impose risks to life, property,  and the natural world in Ontario that cannot be ignored. Reducing those immediate risks is  the only prudent course of action for all levels of government, as well as communities,  corporations, businesses, and individual citizens.  - Climate Ready Ontario   “And now our world is different. The climate has been permanently altered and is on an  escalating vector of change, not because of what we are going to put into the atmosphere in  the future but as a consequence of what we have already done”. - Environmental  Commissioner of Ontario, 2009/2010 Annual Report.       Climate Change Adaptation Plan 2012     7                                   Climate Change and the Economy   A recent report “Climate Ready Ontario’s Adaptation Strategy and Action Plan 2011-2014” highlighted   the economic reality of failing to adapt to climate change.  Based on the Economics of Climate Change   (2006), Ontario could see annual costs of about $5.66 billion dollars annually to respond to extreme   weather brought by climate change.v For example, the Ontario Disaster Relief Assistance Program has   provided over $60 million since 1998 for flood relief alone in part due to an increase in the number of   significant urban flooding events, including floods in Peterborough, Ottawa, Sudbury, Hamilton and   Toronto.     In 2011, the National Round Table on the   Environment and the Economy (NRTEE) published   their report “Paying the Price: The Economic   Impacts of Climate Change for Canada”.  In this   report, the NRTEE expects the costs of climate   change to escalate over time from an average of $5   billion/year in 2020 to $21 to $43 billion/year by   2050 depending on global emissions.vi  These costs   will not be equally distributed across the country   with greater costs predicted for some coastal areas.     At first glance, the costs of adaptation are often   readily identified and dismissed as too expensive by   many governments and businesses.

Municipalities have a significant role to play in climate change adaptation.  Many of the impacts of   climate change will directly affect the services provided by the City of Windsor and our agencies,   including:  wastewater and stormwater management; transportation; parks and urban forests; social   services; emergency services; public health; and electricity distribution.   The actions taken today by the City of Windsor will enhance community resilience to climate change   with the objective to reduce the human and economic costs of climate-related impacts.     Windsor’s Changing Climate   Between 1948 and 2008, the average annual temperature in Ontario has increased by up to 1.4 °C, with   scientists predicting that by 2050, the average annual temperature in Ontario will increase by 2.5 °C to   3.7 °C from the 1961-1990 baseline average.   Annual Average Temperature   The Environment Canada weather station located at Windsor Airport has been monitoring and recording   weather data since 1941.  Since this time, the average annual temperature has increased by almost 1 °C.                                    The Canadian Climate Change Scenarios Network (CCCSN), supported by Environment Canada’s   Adaptation and Impacts Research Section (AIRS), with support from universities and other partners   0   2   4   6   8   10   12   14   16   18   1 9  4 1     1 9  4 6     1 9  5 1     1 9  5 6     1 9  6 1     1 9  6 6     1 9  7 1     1 9  7 6     1 9  8 1     1 9  8 6     1 9  9 1     1 9  9 6     2 0  0 1     2 0  0 6     2 0  1 1     Te m  p e  ra tu  re  °  C    Year   Figure 3: Average Annual Temperature in Windsor (1941 - 2008)   Mean Max Temp Mean Temp Mean Min Temp     Climate Change Adaptation Plan 2012     9     provides the ability for municipalities to undertake regional modelling on climate change.  The Localizer   Reports developed by the CCCSN uses an “ensemble” approach, which means that numerous models   are used to determine projections rather than basing projections on just one model. Comparisons with   past climate models show that ensemble projections are usually more realistic than any single modelvii.   Throughout the City of Windsor’s adaptation planning process, two climate change scenarios were   examined: the high (A2) and the low (B1) emissions scenarios. Each scenario projection is completed as   an ensemble of over 20 different global climate models. However, it has been noted that the highest   emissions scenario (A2) is closest to the observed trends with recent data showing climate change is   advancing more quickly than previously estimated.      The following table shows the average annual temperature projections above the baseline period   (1971-2000) based on the two scenarios. Projections to 2050 are often the most reliable as model   results begin to diverge after 2050.   Table 1: Average Annual Temperature Projections for Windsor.   Year  B1 Scenario  (Low Emissions)   A2 Scenario  (High Emissions)   2020  1.3 ± 0.3 °C 1.2 ± 0.3 °C  2050 2.0 ± 0.5 °C 2.6 ± 0.5 °C  2080 2.6 ± 0.6 °C 4.4 ± 1.0 °C   Though the average projection increase may be perceived as a minor change, it actually can have a   significant impact on the region.  As figure 4 below indicates a slight increase in the mean average   temperatures will lead to more ‘hot’ and record ‘hot’ weather with less cold weather.  This shift in the   average weather for the region allows for the survival of invasive species, the expansion or introduction   of insect vectors that carry disease, increase in ‘heat alert’ days and increase evaporation of surface   waters that contribute to an increase of extreme precipitation events.                              Figure 4: An increase in mean temperature leads to a shift towards a new, hotter climate.

The City of Windsor was one of a few communities that were selected for analysis of extreme   temperature.  The temperature projections were completed by the Canadian Regional Climate Model   (CRCM) developed by the Ouranos Consortium on Regional Climatology and Adaptation to Climate   Change (Figures 5 and 6). The conclusions of the analysis predict that the number of days over 30oC/86°F   in Windsor could almost quadruple by 2071–2100 over that experienced prior to 2000.  The number of   warm nights (over 22oC/72°F) is expected to increase even more dramatically—a tenfold increase by   2071–2100.viii                                                                      Figure 5: Projection of the number of hot days (above 30 oC) per year.    Figure 6: Projection of the number of warm nights (above 22 oC) per year.      Climate Change Adaptation Plan 2012     11     Figure 7 highlights the association between all   non-traumatic daily deaths that occurred from   June 1 to August 31 from 1986 to 2005 and the   historical maximum daily temperatures in   Windsor. There is a strong association between   temperature and excess mortality in the City of   Windsor. As the figure shows, at approximately   29°C/84°F excess mortality begins to increase as   ambient temperatures increase.ix        Annual Precipitation   Using the information obtained from the Windsor Airport station, an increasing trend in annual   precipitation has been documented.                                  Based on the Canadian Climate Change Scenarios Network model described above, the future   precipitation projections have been established in the following table.

Since 1970, there has been increasing evidence of heavier short duration (24   hours or less) rain events in southern Ontario.  The following table summarizes the average trends in the   amount of annual maximum rain events.     Table 3: Summary of the observed and projected increases in rainfall over time in Windsor.

And Noble, D. (2006) x      Recent extreme rain intensities in North Toronto 2005,   Peterborough 2004 (photo insert) and the northern Grand River   basin 2004 suggest there may be even more rapid trends   towards increasing magnitude of heavy rain events in isolated   storms.     The City of Windsor has also been experiencing more intense   rain events including:    Intense rainfalls estimated at or above the 1:50 year climate normal return frequency   o Westside flooding in 2007.  Anecdotal evidence and numerous reports estimated that   100mm of rain fell in less than an hour.    o June 5 & 6 2010 flooding.  Approximately 90mm of rain fell in 4 hours     2011: Windsor’s wettest year.  In 2011, the City of Windsor experienced the wettest year ever   on record with 1568.2mm of rain compared to the average annual rainfall of 844mm.    November 29th, 2011 alone received 75mm of rain.     Surface Water Temperatures and Great Lakes Water Levels   The temperatures of surface waters will continue to rise with the increase in annual temperatures.  This   increase may allow for the establishment of new invasive species, as well as an increase in algae growth.    Based on historical temperature monitoring of western Lake Erie, the length of winter (days with water   temperatures below 4°C) is getting shorterxi.  A loss of ice cover may result in increased erosion of   shoreline that was typically protected by winter ice.  Open surface water also allows for more   evaporation.   Figure 9: A flooded street in Peterborough.     Climate Change Adaptation Plan 2012     13     Although most scenarios of future climate projects increases in regional precipitation, the increase in   evaporation caused by higher temperatures is expected to lead to an overall decrease in the Great Lakes   System water levels.  Increased evaporation is expected in all seasons, and particularly in winter as a   result of decreased ice cover on the lakes.  The impacts of lower water levels will be most pronounced in   parts of the system that are already shallow, specifically western Lake Erie, Lake St. Clair, and the St.   Clair and Detroit Riversxii. Canadian modelling predicts a significant lowering of lake levels by 2050 as a   long-term average, with a predicted decline of 0.8 m for Lake Eriex.    The lowering of water levels in the Great Lakes –St. Lawerence System may impact several sectors as   identified in the figure below.         Some economic losses associated with a decrease in lake levels are easily calculated.  For a 2.5 cm   lowering of Lakes Michigan-Huron, cargo ships must reduce loads by 90 to 115 tonnes worth   approximately $25,000 US per tripx.  Based on historical water level changes, it is known that   hydroelectricity output may be reduced by up to 26% at some stations with lower water levelsxii.

Climate Change Adaptation Plan 2012     14     Examples of Climate Change Impacts   The City of Windsor has already been impacted by the effects of climate change. The figure below   outlines some of the issues we have already faced and the consequences we have had to deal with. As   shown, the effects vary across city departments and range from environmental, to economic, to human   health risks.              Figure 11: Examples of climate change impacts already affecting the City of Windsor.     Climate Change Adaptation Plan 2012     15     What Windsor is Already Doing   The City of Windsor has already instituted a number of programs that increase the resiliency to potential   climate change impacts (Figure 12).  Several of these programs were instituted or expanded following   significant events identified in the previous section.  For example, the downspout disconnection   program was expanded following the intense rainfall events of 2006, 2007, while the basement flooding   program was initiated after the 2010 intense rainfall event.                 Figure 12: Examples of how the City of Windsor is already adapting to climate change.     Climate Change Adaptation Plan 2012     16     Towards the Development of a Climate Change Plan   City Council Direction   On January 23rd 2012, City Council passed a motion approving the development of a corporate wide   Climate Change Adaptation Plan with a focus on impacts with a medium high – extreme risk rating as   recommended by the Environment and Transportation Standing Committee (M29-2012).   Risk is defined as the combination of an event’s likelihood and the severity of its consequences – risk   therefore equals the probability of projected impact multiplied by the consequence severity of that   event.  This initiative interpreted the risks levels, broadly speaking, as follows:    Extreme risks demand urgent attention at the most senior level and cannot be simply accepted   as a part of routine operations without executive sanction.    High risks are the most severe that can be accepted as part of routine operations without   executive sanction but they will be the responsibility of the most senior operational   management and reported upon at the executive level.    Medium risks can be expected to form part of routine operations but they will be explicitly   assigned to relevant managers for actions, maintained under review and reported upon at   senior management levels.    Low risks will be maintained under review but it is expected that existing controls will be   sufficient and no further actions will be required to treat them unless they become more   severe.   Internal Consultation   Through consultation with all City departments and some City agencies, a list of over 250 potential   impacts was realized.  Using the ICLEI climate change adaptation initiative framework, vulnerability and   risk assessments were completed to give each impact a designated risk level.    City of Windsor Potential Climate Change Impacts   Medium High – Extreme Risk Impacts   The following five potential climate change impacts were rated as posing at least a high risk to our   municipality. Therefore, the focus of this adaptation plan is on the following impacts:   1. Development policies created in the absence of Climate Change considerations may create   additional vulnerabilities to the impacts of climate change.   2. Increase in operating/maintenance demands to deal with climate extremes.   3. Increased chance of flooding to basements, roads and other infrastructure.   4. Increase in demand to all areas of Operations when responding to an increase in severe storms   (during and after).   5. Increase in public health risks due to extreme heat.     Climate Change Adaptation Plan 2012     17     Medium– Low Risk Impacts   Though the focus of this plan is to minimize medium high - extreme risk impacts, it is important to be   aware of the other potential impacts discussed during internal consultations. Various adaptation   measures may provide resiliency for more than one potential impact. Though the majority of the   potential impacts discussed are negative (table 4), it is important to consider the possible advantages   that may occur under a changing climate (table 5).    Table 4: Potential Low – Medium Risk Negative Impacts of Climate Change in Windsor: At a Glance   Projected Climate Potential Impacts   Increase in Average  Temperature    Increased opportunity for invasive species    More opportunity for vector borne diseases (West Nile, Lyme disease)    Increased demand for active transportation options  Increase in Winter  Temperatures    Increase in freeze/thaw cycles damaging roads, increasing winter control    Reduced ability to maintain outdoor ice rinks  Increase in Summer  Temperatures    A shift in physical activities to indoor venues    Decrease in air quality/increase in the number of smog days    Increased demand for electricity    Increase risk of brown/blackouts due to the demand for electricity    More rapid deterioration of infrastructure     More premature equipment failure    Increase chance of food-borne illnesses  Increase in Annual  Precipitation    Increase in plant growth    Increase risk of flooding to basements, roads and other infrastructure    Increased risk of erosion of stream banks, drains    Increase costs for storm water management  Increase in Winter  Precipitation    Increase risk of ice damage to urban forest    Increase in winter control costs    Increased risk of winter flooding/ice jam related flooding  Decrease in Summer  Precipitation    More stress/failures among tree plantings    Increased need for irrigation    Decrease in aquatic habitat  Increase in Frequency  of Extreme Weather    Increase risk of flooding (basement, road, stream)    Increase flooding of sport fields requiring closure    Damage to existing tree cover    Increase demand for emergency services to respond to extreme events    Increase in combined sewer overflows or waste water  bypasses  Increase in Surface  Water Temperatures    Increased opportunities for invasive aquatic species    Decrease in surface water quality (more algae, e-coli)    Increase in shoreline erosion  Decrease in Great  Lakes Levels    Possible loss of access to marinas    Increased erosion    Undermining of shoreline protection structures, exposure of outlets            Climate Change Adaptation Plan 2012     18     Table 5: Potential Low – Medium Positive Impacts of Climate Change in Windsor: At a Glance   Projected Climate Potential Impacts   Increase in Average  Temperature    More opportunities to participate in active transportation or outside  recreational activities   Increase in Winter  Temperatures    Reduced heating costs    More moderate winters,  more attractive for retirement  Decrease in Summer  Precipitation    Increased opportunities for use of solar power technologies (streetlights,  parking meters)   Increase in Surface  water temperatures    Increase in water recreational opportunities   Proposed Adaptation Options   The table below summarizes our proposed short-term adaptation actions in response to the medium   high – extreme risks identified above.  The anticipated changes in climate that garnered the most   concern to the City of Windsor were: increase in precipitation and increase in extreme summer heat   events. The adaptation actions in Table 6 are divided into sub-categories, based on the type of risk they   reduce. Many of these short-term actions build on existing programs in recognized areas of   vulnerability.  Other adaptation options may be fairly new to the City of Windsor, however there is a   growing level of experience for such actions amongst other municipalities.   Table 6: Proposed short-term adaptation actions for the City of Windsor   Adaptation Action Anticipated Benefit Co-Benefits   Reducing Risks Associated with Increased Precipitation  Mandatory Downspout  Disconnection   Reduce flooding, and pressure  on storm, sanitary and combined  sewer systems , reduces number  of treatment plant overflows   Improved storm water quality   Mandatory Backwater valves Reduce the risk of basement  flooding to individual homes      Enhance Sewer Maintenance &  CCTV Program (camera  inspections of sewers)   Reduce the risk of basement  flooding    Allows prioritization of sewer  repairs/replacement, identifies  problems before the required  repairs become very costly and  disruptive to residents   Consideration of additional Off- Line Storage for Stormwater   Reduce the risk of basement  flooding   Reduce the amount of combined  sewer overflows   Increase the Use of Flow  Restrictors on Catch basins   Reduce the risk of basement  flooding    Reduce the amount of combined  sewer overflows   Seal Manhole Covers Reduce the risk of basement  flooding   Reduce the amount of combined  sewer overflows   Update of the rainfall intensity  duration frequency (IDF) Curves   Improves ability to design storm  drainage infrastructure for  extreme runoff events, reduces  future City maintenance costs         Climate Change Adaptation Plan 2012     19     Initiate flow monitoring of  priority sewers   Enhance the resiliency of the  sewer system and improve  assessment of risk to flooding      Undertake Public Education  on  Sewer Use, Waste Water  Treatment   Enhance the resiliency of the  sewer system as the public  understands their impact on the  system      Targeted Education towards  homeowners with suspected  cross-connections to sanitary  sewer   Direct engagement with the  public to increase individual  resiliency to basement flooding      Use Social Media and other  Communication tools to warn  public of Risk of Basement  Flooding   Direct engagement with the  public to increase individual  resiliency to basement flooding      Enhanced Maintenance &  Inspection of roads and  sidewalks during snow or  extreme weather events   Reduce opportunity for bodily  injury and reduced potential for  liability       Reducing Risks associated with increasing precipitation and temperatures   Development of a Green Roof  Policy   Reduction in storm water runoff,  improved storm water quality   Mitigation of the Urban Heat  Island Effect and reduces  summer air conditioning demand    Develop pilot projects for the  use of Porous Pavement on City  properties and develop  guidelines for development    Reduction in storm water runoff  and flows to the waste water  treatment plant   Improved storm water quality   Installation of Rain Gardens as a  pilot project to determine  effectiveness   Reduction of storm water runoff  and temporary storage for larger  events   Improved storm water quality   Improvement and Enhancement  of Green Space to improve rain  water retention   Reduction of storm water runoff  Mitigation of the Urban Heat  Island Effect, improvements to  air quality, improved quality of  life for the residents of the City   Increase Tree Planting Reduced Urban Heat Island  Effect   Reduce storm water runoff,  improved quality of life for the  residents of the City   Reducing Risks associated with increasing temperatures  Increase Capital for Shade  Structures   Decreased risk of heat illness for  Windsor residents and visitors      Increase in Heat Education at  Community Centres and Pools   Increased awareness of heat- health risks which increases the  resiliency of individuals      Complete an Urban Heat Island  Study   Identification of Windsor’s ‘Hot  Spots’ and their causes as well as  the prioritization of actions to  reduce them   Reduced heat-health  vulnerability     Climate Change Adaptation Plan 2012     20     General   Develop Clear Policies for  Weather Response   Increase resiliency of  departments to respond to  major events      Creation of an Extreme Weather  Fund Reserve   Minimize the impact to annual  operating budgets      Note: Each of these adaptation options are outlined in more detail in Appendix A    Continual Improvement of the Climate Change Plan   While these short-term actions may help reduce Windsor’s vulnerability to current events and future   climate change scenarios, the City also needs to develop on-going strategies that will continue to   address the changing climate over the long-term.  As the science of climate change continues to advance   and the knowledge outlining the most effective ways to reduce climate change impacts develops, the   City must continuously look at enhancing the resiliency of the community using the best available   knowledge.  The following strategies should be undertaken to ensure that the City of Windsor continues   to be a leader on adaptation well into the future:   1. Incorporate climate change adaptation into city policies and high level plans;   2. Create internal mechanisms to ‘ask the climate question’ for new major infrastructure projects;   3. Monitor climate change, evaluate the effectiveness of adaptation strategies and adjust as   needed (adaptive management);   4. Use best available science to analyze how the climate is changing locally and how this may   impact the community;   5. Routinely review the City of Windsor’s vulnerability to climate change;   6. Continuously conduct risk assessments to identify priority impacts requiring adaptation actions,    7. Engage the public, business and other stakeholder groups.   Conclusion   As stated in the City of Windsor’s Environmental Master Plan, “The City of Windsor is committed to   being a leader through its daily actions and services to enhance the environment for present and future   generations”.  This is shown through the commitment of City Council and City administration on the   development of this Climate Change Adaptation Plan.  As one of the first municipalities in Ontario and   Canada to undergo adaptation planning, Windsor has committed to building a more resilient and livable   community.   This adaptation plan is not the end of the climate change discussion.  As highlighted in this report, the   City of Windsor must continue to review the science and risks associated with the potential impacts of   climate change and modify the plan as required.  In addition, the creation of this adaptation plan does   not negate the necessity of developing and implementing a climate change mitigation plan.  The   mitigation of greenhouse gases is still required to minimize the extent of future climate change impacts.
