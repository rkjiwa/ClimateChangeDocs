This  Guide has been written to primarily to assist  local and regional governments understand  the risks of predicted climate impacts and  how to manage them.  The Guide should  also be useful for health officials, emergency  managers, and businesses.    Risk management is a process for selecting  the best course of action in uncertain  situations.  It does this by helping us identify,  understand, analyze and communicate about  risks. The Guide follows the framework for  risk management described in the Canadian  national standard “Risk Management:  Guidelines for Decision-makers” (CAN/CSA- Q850-01).    There are six simple steps in the process:             Step 1: Getting Started   For a specific climate change problem the  team members and concerned stakeholders  are identified and an initial work plan is  drafted.     Step 2: Preliminary Analysis   Team members do a general analysis of the  climate change hazards and identify risk  scenarios created by these hazards. For  each risk scenario vulnerabilities are  identified and a preliminary risk estimation of  frequency and consequence is done.   Step 3: Risk Estimation   A more detailed analysis is made of the  frequency and consequences of the events  in the risk scenarios from Step 2. Also, the  perceptions of those people or groups  affected by this process are identified and  the effects of these perceptions on the risk  scenarios are assessed.   Step 4: Risk Evaluation   The project team evaluates and compares  the risk scenarios from extreme to negligible.  Negligible risks are eliminated from further  consideration. The remaining risks are  ranked and effort is focussed on those  deemed unacceptable.    Step 5: Risk Controls and Adaptation  Decisions   For those risks assessed as unacceptable in  Step 4:     Adaptation measures or risk control  strategies are identified to reduce  risks to acceptable levels.    The effectiveness of the adaptation  measures are evaluated including  their costs, and benefits.    Optimal adaptation measures are  selected and the acceptability of  residual risks is considered.     Step 6: Implementation and Monitoring  The adaptation and implementation plan is  developed including a monitoring process.    Following these six steps will:    Ensure the participation of the  appropriate key people and  organizations;    Ensure that the most serious climate  change adaptation issues are  identified; and      C O  M M  U N  IC A  T IO  N S &   D O  C U  M E  N T  A T  IO N        Getting Started   Preliminary  Analysis      Risk  Estimation      Risk  Evaluation   Adaptation  Measures or Risk   Controls    Action and  Monitoring   Risk  analysi  Risk  assessmen  t  Risk  managemen  t    iii    Provide a format to present climate  change adaptation issues to senior  decision makers.    This Guide suggests using a short version of  the process as a useful technique for getting  started.  It focuses on using readily available  data and a small risk management or project  team.  This will help the team explore the  issues and possible outcomes rapidly and  inexpensively.  The results, supported by  good documentation can be used to make a  strong business case for taking action.  The  documentation from the overview process  can also support a more comprehensive risk  management study if one is needed.       Communication and Documentation  Accurate, inclusive and timely  communication with all participants is vital   throughout the whole risk management  process.  As well, it is important to ensure   that careful records are kept to support  conclusions and to allow for a review of risk  scenarios as the climate change situation  changes.     Presentation  The Guide includes a workbook section (see  Volume 2 of the Guide) that contains  templates for recording information that will  assist in presenting the results in a clear and  lucid manner.      Also included in Volume 2 are case-study  examples from a variety of regions of the  country that will help the reader and the risk  management team understand and apply the  process laid out here.     iv   Foreword      Based on what is known about our changing  climate, communities and governments need to  proceed with urgency to examine their  vulnerability.  As outlined later in this Guide,  there is now convincing evidence that the  climate is changing in response to rising  concentrations of greenhouse gases in the  atmosphere and that the change is accelerating.      Warming in most of Canada, particularly in the  northern regions, has been greater than in most  of the rest of the world. Warming is projected to  be even greater in the future and changes even  faster than in the recent past.     Canada has unique characteristics that makes  the examination of climate impacts and the  responses to them urgent and very important.   Some factors that are particularly important   include, large temperature increases during the  annual climate cycle, in many regions, widely  separated communities with small populations   and modest resources, sparse transportation  infrastructure and huge geographic areas.    This Guide emphasizes simplicity and common  sense in its use.  It can assist municipalities and  others organizations to reduce their  vulnerabilities to the adverse impacts, of our  changing and more variable climate.    Natural Resources Canada and the Institute for  Catastrophic Loss Reduction supported the  development of this Guide to help municipalities  understand and manage risks associated with  climate change and variability.              1  1. Introduction    Global climate change is widely recognized as  one of the world’s greatest environmental, social  and economic threats.  In Canada, climate  changes over the past 35 to 40 years are in part  responsible for the exponential rise in economic  losses from extreme weather events, premature  weathering of infrastructure, stresses on water  supplies, worsening air quality and related  health and economic effects.  Extreme events  and rising temperatures are becoming more  damaging as recent severe rainfalls, thawing  permafrost and melting sea ice have  demonstrated.   Efforts to manage and adapt to climate-related  risks have not kept pace with the challenges.  It  is virtually certain that the climate will continue to  warm and become increasingly variable over the  coming decades.  We are becoming more  vulnerable to the impacts of climate variability  and change because of increasing urbanisation,  a growing and aging population and  deteriorating public infrastructure.  These  changes put more people, property and  ecosystems at risk.     Regional and community governments have  primary responsibility for or can significantly  influence many of the factors that determine  Canadians’ vulnerabilities to climate-related  risks and many of the decisions that help to  manage these risks. Local government officials  increasingly understand projected climate  impacts and are beginning to implement  adaptive strategies.   Provincial and territorial legislation require in one  way or another that local governments take  action to prevent, mitigate or respond to threats  to human health and safety, public property and  the environment within their jurisdictions.      1.1. About the Guide  This Guide will assist regional and local  government planners, health officials,  emergency managers, infrastructure managers  and others understand the risks of potential  climate impacts and the priorities and means of  managing them. The guide should also be useful  for other organizations such as local industry   and businesses to help understand how to  anticipate and deal with a changing climate.   The Guide describes a risk-based approach that  communities can use to adapt to climate change  through long-term planning and short-term  responses.   It can be used in three main ways:    As a reference manual to incorporate risk  management into planning and  management activities related to climate  adaptation,    As a source of examples that illustrate  techniques for managing climate-related  risks and promoting adaptation efforts, and    As a training tool for regional and local  government staff.   The Guide explains how to use the risk  management process as a simple, quick and  logical way to determine the best solutions to  climate adaptation.  The Guide suggests a  straight-forward and simple approach that will  get communities started thinking and acting  about adapting to our changing climate. A time- consuming, expensive or complicated analysis  process is not needed to reach decisions about  climate adaptation.   Chapter 2 and Annex 1 provide insights into  what could be expected in the future climate.  It  offers some suggestions to help officials  incorporate a risk-based approach into planning.     Chapter 3 explains the risk management  process used in the Guide.  It is based on the  Canadian National Standard, “Risk  Management: Guidelines for Decision-makers”  (CAN/CSA-Q850-01).  A standard provides the  benefits of having a nationally accepted process  and terms and is a credible starting point for the  process.   Chapter 4 explains each step in the risk  management process and includes:    A description of the purpose of each step;   An explanation of what to do and how to   do it;    A description of the expected output;   A description of the decision to be made at   the end of each step;      2   A checklist to help ensure that the main  tasks for this step have been undertaken,  and    Case studies or examples illustrating in  detail what is done in each step are  included in Volume 2.   The examples are based on observed and  projected impacts of climate change and  evidence to date of adaptation efforts.1  They are  also based on the actual experiences of  municipal and other users in workshops during  the development and testing of the Guide.        1.2 Reducing vulnerability to  climate change   Climate change literature refers to “adaptation”,  “adaptive capacity” and “vulnerability” and for  the purposes of this guide:    Adaptation to climate change means  making adjustments in natural or human  systems to moderate harm or exploit  benefits arising out of actual or expected  climatic changes     Adaptive capacity is the ability of a  system, region or community to adapt.    Vulnerability means how susceptible  social, economic and environmental  systems are to the adverse effects of  climate change or climate variability.    Adaptation to climate change aims to reduce  vulnerability to the adverse effects and to  enhance adaptive capacity.   1.3 Why risk management?  Risk management is a framework that can be  easily used to identify and understand the  impacts and vulnerabilities of climate change  and also for estimating and ranking risks.  The  process helps us select the best actions to  reduce risks to acceptable levels even when  there are uncertainties about future climate.                                                          1 e.g. Chapters 7 and 8 of “From Impacts to  Adaptation:  Canada in a Changing Climate  2007”, NRCan, 2008 See  http://adaptation2007.nrcan.gc.ca      The impacts of a changing and more variable  climate involve almost every aspect of society  and create risks to the social, economic, cultural  and environmental fabric of our communities.   Making decisions about how to avoid these risks  or to reduce them to an acceptable level can  involve many different decision-makers and  other players, some with conflicting values and  competing interests.     The process outlined in this Guide is a simple  way of getting started, engaging the people who  are affected and identifying other key people  who should be involved. It will also clarify the  important issues that will have to be considered  and how to decide what are the best adaptation  options.   For every climate impact there is a range of  possible responses in time, complexity and cost.   For example, to deal with increasingly frequent  and severe extreme weather events, short term  responses might range from better warnings,  increased maintenance of water management  infrastructure, reduction of storage levels in  reservoirs.  Longer-term responses might  include upgrading water management systems  and better communications equipment.  Multi-  jurisdictional responses could involve the re- routing major transportation arteries and  changes to building codes among others.  The  risk management process will help identify the  best solutions and a range of possible  responses.     Most local governments tend to be focussed on  current issues.  Adapting to an uncertain future  climate may not be a high priority. However,  addressing climate change risks can also benefit  current operations, making them more resilient  to extreme weather, and reducing the need to  repair or rebuild systems sooner than planned.   In some communities the adaptation problem is   being addressed as a strategic issue similar to  environmental issues.  Others deal with climate  change issues pragmatically as problems arise  such as smog, heat waves, wastewater or  emergency management concerns.  Whatever  the approach, the process described in this  Guide will help officials  to identify the issues  and produce well thought-out recommendations.   In summary, risk management offers a simple,  practicable and highly credible approach for  identifying and ranking climate change risk  issues and selecting the best risk-reduction      3  strategies.  The process can be used to rapidly  scope out the complexity of a particular issue.   This is the approach recommended in this  Guide.  However, the process can also cater to  a larger fully comprehensive assessment that  could involve a large number of representatives   from many agencies over a longer period of  time.  Whatever the process, the assessment  will provide a persuasive business case for  adaptation action for decision-makers.   .        4  2.  Climate Change Adaptation Decision-making in Local  Governments     The Earth’s climate is naturally variable due to a  number of factors, including the presence of  naturally occurring greenhouse gases (GHG) in  the atmosphere. The Intergovernmental Panel  on Climate Change concluded that, up to the  mid1960s, the Earth’s warming was attributable  to both human-caused and natural factors, but  since about 1970 it is caused almost exclusively  by increased atmospheric GHG concentrations  from human activities.    Given the current concentrations and the  persistence of GHGs, and the projected further  increases in GHG concentrations, it seems  certain that the climate will continue to change.   International efforts to reduce GHGs, such as  the Kyoto Protocol, would only slow the rate of  change.  Most assessments of future climate  change impacts have been based on  greenhouse gas emissions, and atmospheric  concentration scenarios developed by the  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  (IPCC)  and published in 2000.  The  International Energy Agency, in a 2007 report,  indicated that greenhouse gas emissions to  2030 are likely to increase more rapidly than the  fastest of the IPCC scenarios.  At the same time,  the rate of increase of global atmospheric  concentrations of CO2 have risen since 2000 to  1.9 or 2 parts per million per year compared to  earlier (since 1970) increases of 1.6 ppm/yr.   Thus, climate change impacts are likely to  proceed at a more rapid pace than hitherto  expected and generally reported upon.  For  example, Arctic sea ice and Greenland ice cap  melting have recently occurred more rapidly  than in earlier projections.  Thus, adaptation is  an essential response to ensure that society is  not unduly adversely affected by climate change  impacts.    But adaptation to what?  Some people  mistakenly believe that climate change is simply  a gradual global warming.  It is increasingly  evident that other aspects of climate are  changing, too, especially the frequency and  intensity of extreme weather events.  These two  changes, the general warming and the  increased climate variability, have significant   implications for many aspects of our sustainable  livelihoods.   2.1 Climate trends and projections     Over the last 40 years Canada’s climate has  changed in a number of ways.  Some of the  changes are presented by Province and  Territory in Volume 2 of this Guide.  It is  instructive to compare recent climate trends to  those projected for the coming decades, to  consider whether modeled projections can  reliably inform adaptation decision-making.    The Table below provides an example of the  climate changes observed and projected for  British Columbia. Projected changes take into  account both model results for 2050 and the  observed trends since 1950 to 1970, also driven  primarily by increases in greenhouse gases.      Table 1: Present estimates (2008) of  observed and projected climate changes for  coastal British Columbia    Change To date (2000  from 1950)   By 2050   Mean annual  temperature   1 TO 2°C 2°C to 3°C   coastal   up to 4°C  interior   Mean spring  temperature   1.5 to 3°C 2°C to 4°C   coastal   up to 5°C  interior   Frost free days +10 per decade +10 per decade  Growing degree  days   +5 to 16% per  century   +10%   Precipitation –  Annual   +10 to 25% +10% North;   +5% South   Precipitation –  Spring   10% North;   +30 to 40%  South   +10% North;   +5% South   Rain intensities Heavy precip  days:   5% to l5%  increase      5  Change To date (2000  from 1950)   By 2050   +5%/decade  South   River flows Increased  Winter Spring;     Declined  Summer and  Fall   Peak 15 to 40  days earlier   Trends to  continue   Snowpack, April  1   20 to 60%  decline   Continued  decline   Glaciers Rapid decline  1965 to 2005   Mostly  disappear by  2100   Sea Level Rise 4 to 12cm  over century   0.3 to 0.6 plus  metres by 2100  Significant wave  heights   +1cm/decade More than  +1cm/decade   Intense Winter  Storms   Increased  frequency 10%   +13%  frequency   Other increasing  extremes   Insect  infestations,  wildfires   Winter floods,  storm surges   Threats  continue to  increase   Note:  The above figures are estimates of average  changes.  Trends in specific locations, particularly in  mountainous areas, may be different.    Large-scale internal variations in the climate  system such as the El Nino-Southern Oscillation  (ENSO), the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO),   and the North Atlantic (NAO) related to the  Arctic Oscillation (AO) cause shorter term  departures from the general trends indicated  above.  These departures from the general trend  are for a period of a year or two to a decade.        2.2 The local government planning  context      Many social systems are already vulnerable to  various climate-related and non-climate-related  risks.  Projected climate changes will exacerbate  many of these pre-existing vulnerabilities.     Local governments are accustomed to dealing  with climate-related issues in the course of their  planning and management activities.  For  example, they manage water supplies, design  drainage systems and flood protection, design  and implement heat and smog alert systems,  and control mosquitoes and other disease  vectors.     But dealing with a more rapidly changing climate  is new and may be unfamiliar. The implications  of climate change are not well understood  across departments in many municipalities and  as yet, there are few staff explicitly responsible  for adapting to climate change.  At this time,  most municipal strategic or long-range plans do  not address adaptation to climate change and it  can be difficult to get the issue on the municipal  agenda.     In Canada, the provincial and territorial  governments have a number of laws and  policies which, although they may not reference  climate change and adaptation directly, include  strong provisions for dealing with risks to  municipal infrastructure and the health, safety  and environmental protection of their residents.   This creates a strong and justifiable case for  adaptation planning in a number of key areas.     Another problem facing municipalities is that,  because of heavy staff workloads, it is extremely  difficult to attend to issues that do not seem to  have an immediate impact on municipal  operations.  Sometimes, in order to pursue a  new initiative such as climate change, staff may  have to make a case for the work to take priority  over existing responsibilities.  This could require  a strong business case for approval by senior  management. A relatively quick initial run- through of the process in this Guide can produce  enough evidence of the potential risks and  responses  to form the backbone of a business  case for a more thorough study.     Whether the project is a large one, such as  writing a strategic adaptation plan or a smaller,  one focussed on a particular hazard or  adaptation issue, it is important that council and  senior managers support the project so that it  has adequate resources.     6  3. Overview of the Risk Management Approach     3.1 The risk management process  Risk management is a systematic process for  selecting the best course of action in uncertain  situations.    Risk management provides a framework for  developing strategies to respond to potential  climate changes that create or increase risk.  As  mentioned above, whether it is as a study  around a specific issue such as extreme rainfall  events or as large as a community strategic plan  for climate adaptation, the risk management  process will guide us towards the best solution.   The framework in this Guide is based on the  Canadian national standard “Risk Management:  Guidelines for Decision-makers” (CAN/CSA- Q850).  The process consists of six steps shown  in Figure 1 below.     Figure 1: Steps in the risk management process   The key activities of identifying, estimating,  evaluating and ranking risks and selecting  options to lower risks to acceptable levels  include:    For each climate related risk or situation,  developing a list of all the events or impacts  each could create;    Estimating the probability and potential  consequences of events arising from  situations or hazards;    Identifying actions that can be taken to  avoid negative consequences or lessen  their impact, or to exploit potential benefits;  and     Understanding stakeholders’ perceptions of  the risks and the reduction measures.   A very important part of the process is a  continuous dialogue with all those involved and  affected by the issue. Information about a risk  situation can be interpreted differently by various  groups of people, resulting in quite different  perceptions of risk2. Research has demonstrated  that we tend to perceive risk to children to be  greater than for other age groups   For example  parents may perceive higher risks about water  quality for their children than those  designing  water delivery systems.  Therefore the risk  management process emphasizes the  importance of how events might affect or be  perceived by different groups.     In the risk management process, each step  leads logically to the next, unless the risk issue  is resolved, in which case the process is ended.   Steps can be repeated to include new  information or new analyses, as these become  available.  At the completion of each step there  is a decision to be made as shown in the  “Decision Diamond” in Figure 2.   Figure 2: Decision diamond – decision  options at completion of each step                                                             2 See Annex 2 for a fuller explanation of risk perception.

The  stored records from the previous process will be  very useful when the next iteration is  undertaken.   Throughout the whole process it is important to  have a continuous dialogue with stakeholders  and to keep careful records of all actions taken.      Communications with all people and  groups that are or might be affected by the  issue, even marginal ones, ensures that  their concerns are considered.  This helps to  build support for the results.      Good record keeping of all the major  activities in the process helps to ensure  accountability and consistency.  It provides a  record for future reference.  This is  especially important so that the decision  process can be revisited if new information  becomes available.    For relatively simple risk issues, a short version  of the process can be completed quite quickly,  usually in one or two days.  A small team  consisting of three or four people with moderate  resources can undertake it.  More complex risk  problems may require a larger team and take  more time.     This Guide suggests using a short version of the  risk management process as a useful technique  for getting started.  It focuses on using readily  available data and a small risk management or  project team.  This will help the team explore the  issues and possible outcomes rapidly and  inexpensively.  The results, supported by good  documentation can be used to make a strong  business case for taking action.  The  documentation from the overview process can  also support a more comprehensive risk  management study if one is needed.     3.2 Guiding principles  The risk management process is built upon  several important principles:      Engaging important affected or involved   groups  These groups and individuals should be   identified and involved during the entire  process.  The project team may be modified  to include members of these groups if it will  help deal with the particular issue being  addressed.      Communication  The project team should develop an open  and trustful dialogue that continues  throughout the process, with groups and  individuals who may be affected or involved  with the risk in order to:   Acquire useful information;   Build awareness of the particular risk   and gain support for the process;   Facilitate consultation;   Evaluate how the people involved or   affected accept risks; and   Serve as a part of the monitoring and   review mechanism.     Documentation    Records should be thoroughly and carefully  taken of important meetings, information  sources, and all activities stored in a “risk  information library” so that it can easily be  retrieved in the future.  This will help to:   Review how risk rankings and risk   control options were derived,   Provide baseline information for future   iterations of the process,   Promote accountability and   transparency      Use of existing tools, human and  technical resources   The project team should make maximum  use of existing resources, such as  community data, local knowledge and  technical expertise, and previously  documented experiences.        Public Education and Awareness  Public education and awareness is  important for successfully implementing a  larger risk management process. It helps to  ensure stakeholder support for its results.          8  4. Steps in the Risk Management Process   Introduction    This section describes each step in the risk  management process, explaining its purpose the  actions to be taken and the expected outputs.  A  checklist is also provided. Examples or case  studies in Volume 2 illustrate what is done in  each step. The case studies were developed by  community representatives in a one-day  workshops during the testing of the Guide.    The initial process recommended in this guide is  an overview or simplified examination of the risk  or risks that face the community using a small  project team and readily available information.   This will help define the issues and provide  some readily useable results.     The outcome of the initial process may point to  the need to do a more comprehensive analysis  of all or some of the issues identified, using  more detailed data or more in-depth expertise  with which this guide can also assist.     All the forms and tables suggested in this  chapter are available in the Workbook section of  Volume 2 of this Guide.      STEP 1: Getting Started     Purpose   This step starts the process and completes the  following preparatory activities;    Identification of the specific problem or  hazard and the associated risks to people,  property or the environment.    Identification of the members of the project  team and principal people or groups that  may be affected or involved;    Determination of the responsibilities of  members of the project team and the  resources needed to complete the study;  and      Development of a workplan.   The team leader is usually a community planner  or a member of the lead department involved.  It  is important to have the support of a senior   manager or if it is a large study, the community  council.   The time required by the team to complete the  process depends on the scope of the study, i.e.  a study of a specific climate impact or a larger  strategic study of all impacts.  However, as  suggested in the previous section, it is  recommended that a relatively simple overview  of the problem using readily available data, as  explained in Steps 2 and 3, would be very useful  in developing a better understanding of the  issues and scope of the problem.  To do this, the  team would require only a day or several days to  complete a preliminary overview.     Out of this quick preliminary run through of the  risk management process the team could expect  to:    Have a better understanding of how simple or  complex the issue is,    Obtain a sense for what the main risk control  measures could be, and    Determine whether the preliminary study is  sufficient or a larger more comprehensive  study is needed, and    Know who the important stakeholders are  and how they are likely to perceive the risks.      What to do and how to do it?   (1) Establish the project team and its terms of  reference, and for a larger study, develop  the work plan and the key milestones:    Select team members with the  necessary expertise to deal with the risk  issues being considered.     Ensure that there are representatives  from the main organizations that will be  responsible for implementing the risk  controls.  For a larger study, some  support or clerical staff may be needed  to handle the administrative and  documentation matters.  Others, such  as legal, technical or financial advisors  may be involved at times or review or  advise on certain aspects of the work.    The team leader should ensure that  members of the team know their roles  and responsibilities with respect to the      9  project and are familiar with the risk  management process.   (2) Ensure that the team is clear about the  risk issues to be investigated and any  restrictions on the scope of the study.   (3) For a larger study, estimate the resources  required.    Determine the internal capacity that is  available for the project, including  available data, tools (e.g. GIS), human  and financial resources.    Identify the external resources needed  and prepare the justification to obtain  them if needed.   (4) Assign project team responsibilities,  allocate resources and set schedules.   (5) Do a preliminary analysis to identify the  principal people or groups that may be  affected or involved and begin an  estimate which would:    Identify any individuals or groups that  can affect or may be affected by  decisions or actions resulting from the  risk management process. This group  could be quite large.    Consider their probable interests,  concerns, rights and likely issues.    Begin to think about how members  might perceive various risk issues and  how this might affect the decision  process and communications with them.      Recognize that this group may evolve  throughout the process.    (6) For a larger project develop a risk  communication plan and initiate a  dialogue with principal people or groups  that may be affected or involved:    Key questions to consider include: Who  is responsible for the communication  process?  Who are the key audiences?  How will the impact of the  communications be evaluated? Should  some on-going, formal structure be  considered for communicating with this  group such as a panel? (Annex 2  provides additional information to help  with risk communications.)   (7) Start the record keeping and for a larger  project, a risk information library:    The records or risk information library  should contain copies of all the   information collected throughout the  project, including information on the  risks, data that are used to analyse the  risks, a record of decisions taken, views  of the people or groups that may be  affected or involved, records of  meetings and any other information that  may be obtained during the risk  management process.    These careful records will provide the  means to trace the logic behind any  decisions made.  Also it will make it  easy for the project team to review the  process, should any additional  information become available.   Expected results and outputs    Risk issues are defined.   Project team established.   Terms of reference and budget for project   team developed and approved.    Principal people or groups that may be  affected or involved have been identified  and preliminary analysis of their needs,  concerns and probable issues completed.    Communications or dialogue with groups  that may be affected has been considered.    Collection of records and documentation  begun.   Decision   There are three decision options (see the  decision diamond in Figure 2 on page 6: End,  Go back or Next step/Take action.     End the process if the hazard(s) and risk(s)  are considered by the project team to be  acceptable.    If the risk situation continues to be a  concern, proceed to the Next Step, Step 2  Preliminary Analysis.       Checklist   Step 1: Getting started  Have you:   1. Defined the hazards and   vulnerabilities, and their potential  management implications?    2. Established a project team,  project workplan and team  members’ responsibilities?      10   3. Identified the resources required  to undertake the project, and any  existing capacity that is available to  the project team?    4. Identified the principal people or  groups that may be affected or  involved and begun to define their  probable issues, needs and  concerns?    5. Developed a plan for  communicating with stakeholders?     6. Started a risk information  library?     For examples of how others have done Step  1 see Step 1 in the case studies in Volume 2.    STEP 2: Preliminary Analysis     Purpose   This step is the beginning of the risk assessment  part of the process. The sequence of events or  scenario and vulnerabilities are carefully laid out  for more detailed examination.  The project team  now starts:     To define the climate-related hazard and the   potential risks that may cause harm, in  terms of loss of life, injury, damage to  property, monetary losses to the community  or impacts on the environment.    To consider what the time scales are for the  possible outcomes from the risk situation.    To determine in a very general sense how  complex the process is likely to be, confirm  the probable time-frame for completing the  work and a get a sense for whether the  project team and resources assigned are  sufficient.      What to do and how to do it?   (1) Develop risk scenarios or sequences of  events that could result from the hazards  and vulnerabilities identified in Step 1.   Outline the sequence of events that   could flow from each climate-related  hazard that could cause adverse effects.      Expand each risk scenarios to show the  types of losses or impacts that could  occur.  Losses or impacts could include:   Injuries or deaths,    Health losses due to illness,   Property losses,    Other economic losses    Cultural impacts, and    Environmental or ecosystem losses   or impairment.   The risk scenarios will form the basis for   more detailed risk estimations and  evaluations in Steps 3 and 4.    A simple table, such as Table 2 below,  may provide an easy way to develop  and record this information.         11  Table 2: Preliminary Hazard and Risk Scenario Assessment   HAZARD:  .

Unlikely to occur  2. Moderately frequent occurrence  3. Almost certain to occur   Consequences:  1. Low  2. Moderate  3. High      (2) Collect data and identify the risk baselines.  The first time through the process use  whatever data, community opinions  anecdotal information and other sources that  are readily available:   Review the existing information on   current vulnerability and climate-related  risks, based on previous studies and  experiences and expert opinion.  For  example for a flood hazard what  information can be taken from the most  recent flood experience in your  community or others in the region?    Identify and describe the risk controls  currently in place to manage the specific  climate-related hazard being  considered. Describe their effectiveness  and any gaps. Examples of risk controls  for a flood situation would be a warning  system and evacuation plan, stockpiled  sandbags and so on.    Develop a risk baseline that summarizes  the current level of risk using recent  historical data and current climate  variability, such as recent flood levels,  injuries and losses from the last floods,   any improvements that were made to  protection systems.     Risks related to climate change will be  compared later against current or  baseline risks in order to evaluate the  need for and benefit of additional risk  controls.   (3) Make initial rough estimates of frequency  and severity of the events in the risk  scenarios.  Useful information may be found  in historical records, climate change  projections (such as those in Annex 1) and  by consulting subject matter experts, other  communities and other sources to help  develop these initial estimates.   (4) Continue the analysis of those people or  groups that could be affected by the risk  scenarios:   Now that there is more information on   the potential risks, identify any additional  stakeholders that should be involved.      Refine the analysis of their needs,  interests and concerns.     Consider engaging key people of  representatives of groups that may be  affected by the risks in the management      12  process, if you have not done so  already.    Create a database of these people or  groups that includes their contact  information and the results of your  stakeholder analysis.  Update the  database throughout the process.   (5) If your project team thinks that you may  need a risk communication plan, start to  outline what this would consist of and begin  to implement a dialogue with key people and  groups.   (6) Update the risk information library:   Organize all the information collected in   this step and keep it in a safe, dedicated  space.  This is where all the information,  assumptions, concerns, decisions and  changes made throughout the process  are kept.    The library should include:    Baseline data and information on  the hazards or trends;    Roles and responsibilities of the risk  management team;    Identification of decision-makers,  and scope of decisions to be made;    Complete descriptions of the risk  scenarios;    All stakeholder information,  including minutes of meetings with  them or other records of stakeholder  communications;    A record of all decisions and  assumptions    Record the source of the information  and the date it was collected, and any  weaknesses or inaccuracies in the data   Expected results and outputs    Risk scenarios are developed and a  preliminary analysis is completed for each,  event showing initial estimates of potential  losses and frequency.    Baseline information has been collected, or  plans are in place to collect additional  baseline information.    Additional analysis of people or groups who  might be affected by the risks has been  completed.    An outline of a communications plan for  these people or groups has been developed  if it is needed.    The risk information library is started.   Important reference material is documented   and stored.   Decision   There are three decision options (see the  decision diamond in Figure 2 on page 6): End,  Go back or Next step/Take action.     End the process if the hazard(s) and risk(s)  are considered by stakeholders and the  project team to be acceptable.    Go back to Step 1 or the beginning of Step  2 if the project team considers that it is  necessary to improve on any aspect of the  information developed in those steps or to  make any changes, if appropriate.  Given  the nature of the climate change issue, it is  not unusual to have to improve data  collection and revisit assumptions in order to  enhance the credibility of the entire risk  management process.    If the risk situation continues to be a  concern, proceed to the Next Step.   Checklist   Preliminary analysis  Have you:   1. Developed risk scenarios and   completed a preliminary analysis of  their probabilities and  consequences?    2. Established a baseline of data for  each of the risk scenarios?    3. Developed a stakeholder database?    4. Refined your stakeholder analysis?    5. Updated the risk information library?     For examples of how others have done Step  2 see Step 2 in the case studies in Volume 2.   STEP 3: Risk Estimation   Purpose  In this step a more detailed consideration is  given to the probability or frequency and  consequences of the events in the risk scenarios      13  and the initial estimates that were developed in  Step 2   Based on the initial estimates made in  Step 2 low concern risks can be discarded from  further consideration.   What to do and how to do it?   (1) Consider what methods your team should  use for estimating frequency and  consequences.  Some options are:   Historical records, including community   records and newspapers, to determine  trends of climate events and impacts,     Technical data and climate projections  from Climate projections section of  Annex 1,     Information about climate impacts from  IPCC reports (on line), NRCan  publications (also on line) or from  provincial, territorial, or other federal  government sources (links to on-line  resources can be found in Volume 2),  and     Local Expert or knowledgeable opinions.   (2) Estimate the frequency or likelihood of  possible outcomes**    For the simple analysis suggested in this  guide, an easy four or five tier comparative  rating system (such as a scale from  “occurs very often” to “occurs almost  never”) is useful for assessing the relative  frequency of risk scenarios.    For climate change assessments, events  should be estimated to a future date that  stakeholders can relate to, for example 10  or 20 years into the future, or for major  projects, 40 or 50 years out.    For familiar hazard and events such as  floods, fires or diseases, estimates can  typically be derived from readily available  historical data such as, in research  reports, insurance company records or  from similar risk situations in other  communities, regions or countries.      If the team has the technical experience,  the use of sensitivity-type analyses,  technical projections, expert judgment or  other practicable and credible methods to  put some boundaries or estimate of  uncertainty on the projection of the  frequency of the outcomes.     (3) Estimate the consequences of possible   outcomes:    As with frequency estimates, a simple  comparative impact rating system (such  as a four or five tier scale from “very minor  effects” to “extremely serious effects”) may  be useful for making relative estimates of  various consequences from a particular  risk scenario.  If extensive loss and other  impact data are available, explicit values  could be used in a tabular form so that the  comparative severity can be compared.   At this stage, definitive measures are not  necessary as this is a ranking process to  determine which risks are the most  severe.     Estimate the magnitude of the various  impacts of a risk situation, in the event that  the risk scenario occurs.  Use measurable,  verifiable data wherever possible.  Again,  look for data and information in research  reports, insurance company records or  information from similar risk situations in  other regions or countries.     (4) Assess the perceptions of risk by those   people or groups who might be affected.  As  explained in more detail in Annex 2, these  perceptions of the importance, particularly of  the consequences of risks, is very important  and may have a very big influence on the  ranking of risks.   (5) Display the frequency and consequence  estimates in a tabular or graphical format  that clearly indicates the relative importance  of each scenario.      Determine how best to present the  frequency and consequence estimates.   Consider how stakeholders may interpret  the estimates.  Table 3-1 shows one way  of displaying frequency or probability    It may be helpful to consider the expected  consequences under several sub- categories, for example, social, economic  and environmental aspects.  This may  make comparing the losses or  consequences easier and provide a  baseline for later evaluation of risk control  measures.  Table 3-2 shows one way of  displaying these.  The headings in this  table are generic and the project team  should give some consideration to what  factors are important to them.   It is important that the project team reach a  consensus about the levels of frequency or      14  probability and consequences for each event  in the risk scenario.  If at the end of this step  there is disagreement among team members,  the step should be repeated or the  disagreement flagged for review later.     TABLE 3-1: Frequency / Probability Rating   Probability or  Frequency       Event   Very Unlikely to  Happen   Occasional  Occurrence   Moderately  Frequent   Occurs  Often   Virtually Certain to  Occur   Events from  scenario (list  each)   Not likely to occur  during the planning  period   May occur  sometime but  not often during  the planning  period   Likely to occur  every 5 years or  so during the  planning period   Occurs  annually  during the  planning  period   Will occur more  frequently than once  a year or for some  factors almost  continuously during  the planning period   Note:  If the event is ongoing the frequency is related to it reaching a more severe level than what is  occurring now.

Discussions should be  held about the risk estimates and their  issues and concerns.  In a simple study  this may be through conversations with a  few representatives of the most important  stakeholders.  For larger studies, the   project team might consider using focus  groups, workshops or public meetings.    Communicate information openly and in  language and detail that these people of  groups can understand. Provide  information on the risk baseline (that is the  risk frequency and consequences that  exist now), methods for developing the  risk scenarios and for estimating  frequencies and consequences,  assumptions, third party analyses and any  other relevant information.   Note: In both tables 3.1 and 3.2 the measurements are expressed in comparative terms (“very  unlikely” to “virtually certain” and “very low” to “very severe”).  It is also possible to express these in  numerical values so that adding or multiplying them gives a quantified relative frequency or impact  consequence.  The problem with using numerical values is that the reader may think that it implies  more accuracy than actually exists.  The project team should consider the method to be used to  compare relative frequency and impact or consequence values and agree on the most appropriate  way of assigning relative values.       15   Some people may not agree with the  frequency or consequence estimates.   Record their different views.  Later in the  process, return to this step, if necessary,  to test and discuss the sensitivities of the  proposed adaptation measures to these  different views of frequency or  consequences.     Stakeholders’ issues and concerns will  probably change as they become more   familiar with the risk scenarios and the risk  management process.  Document these  changes on an ongoing basis.    Consider using a chart such as the one  shown in Table 3.3 below to list the  stakeholders and their attitudes about  various risks.         TABLE 3.3  Suggested display for stakeholders and risk perception.   Climate Factors:  (Hazards)   Risk Scenarios -   Aspects of Hazards and Risks to Community   Stakeholders and perception of  Risk   Use a many rows as needed                         (7) Update the risk information library with all  data from this step.  Carefully document all  sources used.   Expected results and outputs   Estimates of frequency and consequences   of risk scenarios.   Presentation of frequency and consequence   estimates in a format that is easy-to- understand by non-experts.    Estimates of the acceptance by  stakeholders of risk, or a record of reasons  for non-acceptance, based on a dialogue  with the stakeholders and a careful  documentation of their perception of the  risks.   Decision    End the process if the estimated risks are  much lower than initially estimated in the  preliminary analysis, and stakeholders agree  that there is no longer a significant concern.    Go back if:   There is new information that needs to   be considered;   Additional risk scenarios need to be   considered;   There are doubts about data quality or   analytical methods; or     Not all important stakeholders are  comfortable with the level of uncertainty  associated with the analysis.    Proceed to the next step if the project team  is comfortable with the data, assumptions  and outcomes of the risk estimation process.   Checklist   Risk estimation     1. Are you satisfied with the quality of your data?   2. Have you analyzed and assigned appropriate   levels of frequency to each event in the risk  scenario?    3. Have you calculated the expected loss or other  consequences from each risk scenario?    4. Are you comfortable that stakeholders’  perceptions have been assessed for each of  the risk scenarios?  Have stakeholders  endorsed your analysis?    5. Has the process been carefully documented  and the risk information library updated with all  relevant information?       For examples of how others have done Step  3 see Step 3 in the case studies in Volume 2.      16  STEP 4: Risk Evaluation     Purpose   In this step, the project team develops a process  for comparing or ranking each risk scenario.   They do this by:    Evaluating the risks in terms of costs,  benefits and acceptability, considering the  needs, issues and concerns of the principal  people or groups that may be affected or  involved.    Identifying unacceptable risks and ranking  them for risk reduction or control measures.      What to do and how to do it?   To this point in the process, only the hazards,  events and risks have been analyzed.  Now the  risks will be compared in terms of the values that  were used in Step 3.  Other factors may also be  brought into consideration such as the costs and  benefits of that might accrue, such as changing  authorized land uses or the location of  recreation facilities.    (1) Compare the risks considering the  probability and consequence analyses from  Step 3.  The team will have to arrive at an  overall consequence rating from the more  detailed assessment of social, economic  and environmental consequences.  It is  suggested that the team use a simple and  convenient consequence scale ranging from  very low to extreme along with the frequency  or probability estimates.    Consider using a “risk evaluation matrix”  to assist in comparing or prioritizing the   various risks.  The chart below in Figure  3 is an example for such a display.  Combine the frequency and  consequence ratings for each risk as  determined in Step 3 into a single value  to be entered into the matrix.  Establish  acceptability values against which the  various risks can be compared.  This  chart uses qualitative measures such as  “very low”, “low”, “moderate”, “major”  and ”extreme”.   Other comparators  such as numerical values may be used  so long as they do not imply an  unrealistic accuracy.    Because experts and non-experts  generally view risks differently, it is  important to maintain an open and  interactive dialogue with the principal  people or groups that may be affected  or involved in order to accurately gauge  their level of acceptance of risks.    (2) It is helpful at this stage to also consider the  costs and benefits of each risk scenario  including not only the direct costs and  benefits but also the important indirect ones.   For example, shorter freezing cycles may  create problems for winter recreational  facilities but it may also bring benefits such  as less snow removal costs.     (3) Assess how the principal people or groups  that may be affected or involved view the  acceptability of risks in your risk matrix.   (4) During the dialogue with stakeholders about  their perceptions and the acceptability of the  risks, begin to identify risk control options to  help reduce unacceptable risks to  acceptable levels. These will be considered  in the next step.   (5) Update the risk information library     17     Figure 3:  Risk Evaluation Matrix     E  xt re  m e          M a  jo r        M o  d e  ra te            L o  w         V e  ry  L  o w          IM P  A C  T  S  E V  E R  IT Y        Very  Unlikely to  Happen   Occasional  Occurrence  Moderately  Frequent   Occurs  Often   Virtually  Certain to   Occur    FREQUENCY/PROBABILITY                    Expected results and outputs    Risks evaluated in terms of probability,  consequence, with some sense of costs and  benefits.    Risks ranked or prioritized.   Unacceptable risks identified.   Meaningful dialogue has occurred with   stakeholders about acceptability of risks.    Risk information library updated.      Decision    End the process if:   Stakeholders agree that all the risks are   acceptable; or    The risks are completely unacceptable,   cannot be reasonably dealt with, and all  stakeholders agree that the process  should be ended.      Go back if:   There is insufficient data or information   to make a decision;   The principal people or groups that may   be affected or involved were not  adequately consulted; or not all key   stakeholders agree with the  conclusions; or     There is new information that might  materially change the frequency or  consequence estimates.    Proceed to the Next Step if stakeholders  agree that the risks are unacceptable and  that risk control measures will have to be  implemented   Checklist   Risk evaluation      1. Are the risk evaluation and ranking   completed?      2. Are all of the major considerations  accounted for?    3. Have you consulted with all key  stakeholders on the acceptability of risks?    4. Have you given preliminary consideration  to controls for unacceptable risks?    5. Is the risk information library updated?     For examples of how others have done Step  4 see Step 4 in the case studies in Volume 2.       Extreme risk:  Immediate controls required          High risk: High priority control measures  required          Moderate risk:  Some controls required to  reduce risks to lower levels           Low risk: Controls not likely required          Negligible risk:  Scenarios do not require  further consideration      18  STEP 5: Risk Controls and  Adaptation Decisions      Purpose   In Step 4 the risks were evaluated and ranked,  and a dialogue was held with the principal  people or groups that may be affected or  involved about the acceptability of the risks.  For  unacceptable risks, some consideration was  given about potential risk control or adaptation  measure being introduced to bring risks down to  acceptable levels.  In this step:     Feasible adaptation measures or risk control  strategies will be identified for reducing  unacceptable risks to acceptable levels.    The effectiveness of the adaptation  measures or risk control strategies will be  evaluated including the costs, benefits and  risks associated with the proposed  adaptation measures.    Optimal adaptation or risk control strategies  will be selected and consideration will be  given to the acceptability of residual risks.   What to do and how to do it?   (1) Identify feasible adaptation or risk control  options:   Identify all potential adaptation actions   that could reduce the frequency or the  consequences of the risks.      Typically, an adaptation or risk reduction  strategy will consist of a portfolio of  measures, for example some short-term  actions to deal with immediate concerns  and some more comprehensive longer- term actions.  Together, these measures  should offer a cost-effective means for   reducing unacceptable risks to  acceptable levels.     Some examples of risk control  measures could include: inspection,  monitoring, research, planning,  relocation, changed guidelines or  standards, mapping, updating  emergency plans, developing capacity,  etc.    (2) Evaluate the adaptation or risk control  options in terms of effectiveness, cost,  residual risks and stakeholder acceptance.    Estimate the effectiveness of the  proposed options using historical data  and the professional judgement or the  project team.       Identify and assess residual risks  caused by the control option.     Communicate with the principal people  or groups that may be affected or  involved on potential control options in  order to gauge their acceptance of risk  controls and perceptions of residual  risks.    Evaluate the risk control options in  terms of:    Its effectiveness in reducing losses  or impacts or changing probabilities.    The implementation and  maintenance costs.    The needs, issues and concerns of  affected stakeholders.    A suggested table for displaying this  information is shown below.       Table 5.1: Risk Controls and Adaptation Measures   Risk     Control or  Adaptation   Measure  (Use as many   rows as needed   Time  Frame   Cost Effectiveness Acceptability Comment /  Evaluation                                        19        (3) For a larger study it may be desirable to  develop an implementation plan for the  adaptation or risk control measures.   (4) If needed, develop a risk communications  plan related to residual risks    Sometimes it may be possible to  encourage private adaptations to further  reduce residual risks.  For example,  communities can encourage residents to  keep valuables out of lower levels that  may flood during a heavy precipitation  event.  The community can influence the  amount of losses from extreme weather  events.   (5) Update the risk information library   Expected results and outputs    Feasible risk control options are identified   An adaptation plan is completed.   The implementation of adaptation measures   has been considered.    The principal people or groups that may be  affected or involved have accepted risks and  residual risks.     Risk information library updated.   Decision    End if there are no feasible adaptation  options.    Go back if:   Adequate data are not available for   evaluating the cost-effectiveness of  potential risk controls.    Key stakeholders have not been  consulted.    Assumptions and uncertainties  associated with estimates are not  acceptable to stakeholders, or    New risks will be introduced if the  proposed control options are  implemented.    Proceed to the Next Step if:    Feasible adaptation or risk control  options are defined and can be  implemented.    Proposed actions are feasible from a  cost and effectiveness perspective and  are acceptable to stakeholders, and    Residual risks are acceptable to  stakeholders.   Checklist   Adaptation and risk control  Have you:   1. Identified and evaluated feasible adaptation   or risk control options, in terms of costs,  effectiveness, stakeholder acceptance and  other criteria?    2. Selected the complement of adaptation or  risk control options that best reduce risks to  acceptable levels?    3. Determined the costs and benefits of the  risk control measures?    4. Assessed and addressed any outstanding  stakeholder concerns?    5. Developed a risk communication plan for  the proposed adaptation or risk control  measures and for the residual risks?    6. Ensured that the risk information library is  updated?      For examples of how others have done Step  5 see Step 5 in the case studies in Volume 2.      STEP 6: Implementation and  Monitoring     The implementation and monitoring component  should be considered even in the preliminary  overview that is the primary focus of this Guide.   It would be done only in cursory form until the  risk management study has been reviewed and   The costs and benefits of adaptation measures can be difficult to assess, so it is important that the project team has access  to the relevant expertise if they need it. An example would be the impact of reduced use of a wastewater treatment facility  because of expected higher water levels.  To build a new facility would be very costly.  In the short term the community  might have to forgo other developments.  In the longer term, better facilities might strengthen the community’s treatment  capacity and allow more residents and businesses without additional infrastructure costs. Any of these outcomes has  associated economic, social and cultural costs and benefits that could affect the analysis.      20  approved by the senior administrator or by the  municipal council.   Some of what is discussed below would be  required only in a larger study or if the study is  approved to move ahead to a more detailed  planning stage.   Purpose    To develop and implement the adaptation  plan.    To ensure that the implementation plan will  be monitored for effectiveness and costs of  the adaptation responses.    To decide to continue or terminate the risk  management process.      What to do and how to do it?   (1) Develop the outline of how the adaptation  plan will be implemented.    Consider priorities for action for each  adaptation measure and develop an  outline implementation plan.      Link the implementation plan to other  programs where possible.  For example,  there may be a program to protect public  health when water quality is compromised.   Your risk control or adaptation measures  for flood risks could be linked to this  program.    Decide the timing for the implementation  of adaptation or risk control measures.   Some risk issues may not surface for  years, or it may not be feasible to address  them immediately.  In these cases, defer  implementation of some components until  a future date.     Establish a date to review the adaptation  plan and record it in the risk information  library.    Before submitting the implementation plan  for approval, review any similar climate  change risk management initiatives, for  example, from neighbouring communities,  and compare your results to theirs.    Look for opportunities to collaborate with  other communities or organizations.   Unfortunately, climate change impacts will  not be related to political boundaries, but  adaptation responses could be.   Collaborate where possible to improve the  effectiveness of adaptation responses.      As part of the implementation plan identify  special expertise or external assistance  that may be required.   (2) Develop and establish the monitoring  process     Monitor the adaptation measures or risk  controls by measuring environmental or  performance indicators, stakeholder  reactions, costs and benefits, or other  indicators.  Some may have been  suggested during Steps 2, 3 or 4, or  during the various stakeholder  communications.     The project team could suggest that a  monitoring and review team be  established to continue this function for as  long as needed.   (3) Submit the implementation plan for  approval.   (4) Continue to communicate with the principal  people or groups that may be affected or  involved.    At this stage, communications might  include ongoing public education and  outreach or information sharing with other  communities and sectors on your  experience with the risk management  process. Consideration should be given to  ensuring that the residual risks are  understood and communicated and that  they will continue to be acceptable.    Record all communications in the risk  information library.     (5) Review and repeat the process, as needed:    Consider repeating the risk management  process if it involves complex issues that  are not fully understood.      In the second iteration, include new  information as it becomes available and  improve the analytical methods for  drawing results and conclusions.   Expected results     Outline implementation plans that include:  o An overview of costs and milestones.  o A list of experts and expertise that was   revealed during the risk management  process that can contribute to the  adaptation response and risk controls.      21  o A database of ongoing activities that  could facilitate the implementation of the  plans.   o Consideration of information exchange  across sectors and between other  communities.   o Mechanisms for training and capacity  building in the risk management process  and on climate change impacts.   o Considerations for reporting on progress  and evaluating results.   o An evaluation and monitoring process  plan.    Implementation initiated   Risk information library updated.   Include   documentation of the methodology for  implementation that can be made available  to other vulnerable sectors and other  regions.

Summary and Conclusions    This Guide is intended to be a tool to help  municipal and local governments and other  organizations make sensible and practicable  decisions to adapt to a changing and more  variable climate.   It uses a process that is based on a national risk  management standard that is accepted by  senior managers, scientists and the financial  community across Canada.  The Guide is written  to emphasize the simplicity and practicality of  the process.  It also recognizes that larger  studies of climate risks and adaptation  responses may be desired or necessary and the  process is equally applicable to these situations.          The costs of climate change are already  becoming apparent in every aspect of  community life; damages from severe weather  events, additional construction costs for unstable  soils and so on.  The sooner that adaptation  measures can be implemented the sooner that  measures can be developed to control costs  related to climate change.   This Guide suggests that some preliminary  analyses could be undertaken at little cost that  would provide a convincing case for adaptation  action.  Officials of local governments could use  these analyses to promote a higher priority for,  and early consideration of, climate risk.     Even though it is evident that climate change is  already occurring there is still time to take  effective adaptation actions.  The Guide includes  a summary of the most important current  documentation and a list of references if further  research or information is desired.   The risk management process outlined here  provides a simple and very credible technique  for assessing the most important actions that will  be needed to address the changing climate  risks.  It is not only methodical and easy to use  but it also emphasizes the importance of  communicating with those affected by these  risks and gauging acceptability of proposed  adaptation measures.     The process does not end with the first iteration.   It requires that the adaptation or risk control  measures be monitored and periodically  validated.  It also requires that new information  and new technologies that would alter the risk   estimations be included in a repeat of the  analysis.      The case studies and examples in Volume 2 of  the Guide are intended to illustrate the process.   In order to keep the text as short as possible,  the examples have purposely been kept simple  to demonstrate the process not the detail of the  risk.  The forms and tables used in Chapter 4  are available for photocopying in the Workbook:  in Volume 2 of the Guide.    Finally, a brief description of the importance of  risk perception and a glossary of risk  terminology is included.  The recognition that  different people and organizations perceive the  same risks very differently is vitally important to  a successful risk management process. Also,  differing risk terminology has been and is still  being used by various professional bodies and  sciences.  The glossary of terms that is taken  from the Canadian national standard will provide  some relief for users of this guide from the  inevitable arguments about terminology.             23  Annex 1:  Risk Communications and Perceptions    Introduction:     An individual or a work team that will be making  decisions about risk should understand the risk  in terms of the needs, issues, and concerns of  the affected stakeholders.  There will also be a  requirement to communicate with a broad  variety of individuals, organisations, informal  groups, the news media and governments about  risk.  This Annex provides some insights into the  difficulties of understanding perceptions about  risk and some thoughts about how to effectively  communicate about risks.     Risk Perception - How Different People Value  Things Differently:   The value associated with something that may  be lost or is at risk differs from one individual to  another.  It can also differ for the same  individual, depending on his or her  circumstances at the time.  For example, take  individual responses to extremely hot weather.   A worker in an air conditioned building, who  travels to work from an air conditioned  apartment complex in air conditioned public  transit may not feel much stress or discomfort.   On the other hand, an outside worker who lives  in an uncooled apartment and drives to work in a  car without air conditioning would find the heat  very stressful.  The two individuals perceive the  value of air conditioning quite differently  because of their differing needs and priorities at  the time.  The inside worker would find the risk  of losing his air-conditioned environment much  more disturbing than the outside worker   This sense of value may also vary a lot  depending on the time or other transient factors.  For example, the inside worker’s valuation of his  air-conditioned environment may be  substantially lower in the cool early morning than  in the heat of the afternoon.  If the air  conditioning is too cold, it may not be wanted at  all.  In fact over air conditioning may generate a  negative value if the person gets sick from being  too cool.   Now consider the risk of losing the air- conditioning completely.  If the weather is very  hot, the inside worker may find any risk of losing  the air-conditioning unacceptable.  If, on the   other hand, the weather is very cool, he or she  may be indifferent to losing the air-conditioning.     The acceptability of the risk depends on the  value or utility placed on the item at risk (in the  example above, air-conditioning), which  depends on the needs of that individual, at that  specific time.   Not all considerations of utility are time- sensitive.  For example, if we value the  environment, we probably always will value the  environment.  If we are concerned about a  changing climate, we will probably always be  concerned about the changing climate and how  to adapt to it.  The terms “needs”, “issues”, and  “concerns” are often used to refer to those  factors that affect our perceptions of risk.   Different people can value the same loss  differently because the loss may affect their  overall satisfaction, or their needs, issues, and  concerns, differently.    The issue of perceived value has been often  overlooked in dealing with risk situations when  the risk is based on the simple equation:   Risk = Probability x Consequence   Many think that this equation is inadequate as a  practical definition of risk when the perception or  acceptability of risk is included and that a more  appropriate expression of risk would be:   Risk = Probability x Consequence x  Perception   Consider another example related to the  perception or acceptability of risk of lowered  water levels in a lake by two communities with  different concerns and perceptions.  One  community derives much of its income and  employment from commercial marine traffic in its  harbour.  Another community, also situated on  the lakeshore, values the lake for its scenery  and for light recreational use.   As a result of a changing climate, both  communities are told that lake levels are likely to  be between 1 and 1.5 metres lower by 2050.   The first community will face disastrous  employment and economic losses because the  main shipping channel for which it is the         24  principal port will be too shallow for the heavy  marine traffic that now uses it.  An alternate  channel with greater depth will still be navigable  and another port city would benefit from the shift  in traffic.   The impact of lower water levels on the second  community would be relatively minor and its  shoreline is fairly steep and would still  accommodate recreational boating and marinas.     How each community perceives the risk and  what kinds of actions will be needed on the part  of decision-makers will depend upon the value  placed on the impact of the changed water  levels.  For the first community, huge amounts of  resources will be needed to deepen the main  shipping channel and the harbour facilities  themselves.  This in turn may be very  threatening to the marine ecosystems in the  area.  For the second community, very little  financial or environmental costs are anticipated.   Even though both communities face the same  risk of lowered water levels the first sees this as  a major challenge that threatens the viability and  economic well-being of its residents.  The  second views it as a minor inconvenience.  Even  though the probability associated with lowered  water levels is the same, and the consequence  of the potential loss is very different.     The acceptability of the risk and how it can vary  from one community to the next is not the same  because the value placed on the potential loss  can differ completely.  This is because the  needs, issues, and concerns differ widely.   Decision-makers often overlook or ignore these  differences in perceived value and, as a result,  many decisions create controversy.   Risk Communications – How to Talk to  People about Risks:   General:  Risk communication goes beyond  simple messages providing information.  It is  based on a dialogue that allows stakeholders to  participate in the decision-making process.     Some reasons why providing information  through simple public relations releases or one- way public education are not useful strategies  include:  (a) They will not reduce the conflict that will   probably develop concerning a risk and what  to do about it,   (b) Because people do not have the same  ability to understand and relate to a   particular risk, these strategies do not  ensure that decisions will be easily  understood and supported by stakeholders,  and   (c) Providing people with scientific information  alone will not enable them or the decision- maker to resolve important risk issues.   Not to communicate with stakeholders or to  delay communicating about risk is not effective  an effective strategy and may be very costly in  the long term.  The reasons are that  stakeholders resent risks that are imposed on  them and risk decisions made without their  input.  Most people believe that they have a right  to be involved in the decisions that affect them  and that the decision-making process should be  accessible.  Involving stakeholders builds  acceptance and can bring out constructive  ideas.  Effectively communicating about risks is  important.     Effective Risk Communication:  Effective risk  communication is the responsibility of the  decision maker, not the stakeholder.  The most  important benefits of an effective risk dialogue  strategy are that it leads to shared  understanding, shared goals and better  decisions.  It builds trust and encourages buy-in  by reducing misperceptions and improving the  understanding of the science and technical  aspects of the risk.   On the other hand, ineffective risk  communications may lead to some or all of the  following:    Irreplaceable loss of credibility,    Unnecessary, costly and possibly bitter and   protracted debates and conflicts with  stakeholders,     Difficult and expensive approval processes  for projects,    Diversion of management attention from  important problems to less important  problems,    Non-supportive and critical co-workers and  employees, and     Unnecessary human suffering due to high  levels of anxiety and fear.   Credibility:  Credibility, being seen by  stakeholders as trustworthy and competent, is a  key goal.  The characteristics of credibility  include candour, commitment, competence,  dedication, empathy, honesty, resolve, respect,         25  and understanding.  Credible messages must be  based on known facts and with previous  statements.  They should be framed in  stakeholder terms, not self-serving language or  jargon, and be consistent with the messages of  others.  Credibility is very difficult to establish,  easy to lose and almost impossible to regain  once lost.  For this reason some specialised  training in risk communications is recommended  prior to initiating the risk management process.   Stakeholders:   It can be extremely important to  include even minor stakeholders in the process  if these stakeholders believe that the outcome of  the decision is important to them.  These "minor"  players may be much more influential than the  risk management team anticipates.  Even a  small group of stakeholders may effectively  mobilize public opinion and halt or delay an  activity they feel presents an unacceptable risk.     For example, a local environmental  group rallied to stop a greenhouse gas  collection project being built because  they believed the facility could worsen  the community’s air pollution problem.   Even though the risk was very small  from a technical point of view the  environmental group believed that it was  still unacceptable.  Because the  company sponsoring the project failed to  address these specific concerns and  even though all the other key  stakeholders supported the project, this  small group effectively mobilized public  opinion against it.  The company, after  spending a large amount of time, effort,  and money, was forced to withdraw its  permit request.     It is important that stakeholders with the  potential to stop a project be identified as early  in the process as possible.   Regardless of whether stakeholders might  actually be affected by an activity or decision,  they must be included as legitimate stakeholders  if they believe themselves to be affected. These  stakeholders may be able to mobilize public  opinion against a proposed project regardless of  the scientific risk.  They may also choose to  leave the decision process if they receive  enough credible information to understand that  the activity really does not affect them.   For example, in the greenhouse gas  collection project described above, if the   company had analysed the  environmental groups’ concerns it would  have found that their information was  based on a number of misconceptions  related to some technical and social  aspects of the activity.  Through a  dialogue process, the concerns of the  environmental group were addressed,  and the misconceptions about the  technical issues were corrected. As a  result the group’s concerns were  alleviated and the project went ahead.    This stresses the need for an effective  communication process to facilitate this transfer  of information between the decision-maker and  other stakeholders.   It is important that the risk management team  clearly considers what the stakeholders’ needs,  issues and concerns are before proceeding with  a stakeholder dialogue.  There are numerous  examples of decision-makers addressing the  wrong issue.    For example, again in the greenhouse  gas collection project when the  company carefully analysed the  environmental groups’ concerns they  believed that the key issue for the group  would be emissions from the project.   However, through a careful dialogue  with the group the company also found  out that a secondary issue was related  to transportation.  The group thought  that the new GHG collection facility,  because it was the first in the region,  would result in a dramatic increase in  tourist traffic that would create a risk for  their children.  Once this and the  emissions issues were addressed, the  stakeholders were satisfied.   Trust:  Stakeholders often believe that the  process of communicating with them about an  issue is as important as the eventual resolution  of the issue.  It is through the dialogue process  that the risk management team has the  opportunity to gain stakeholders' trust.  If the risk  management team fails to communicate to the  satisfaction of the stakeholders, trust in the  process could be quickly lost.    Research in the area of stakeholder perception  has shown that "trust" is a key determinant of  stakeholders' acceptance of risk. That is, if  stakeholders trust those who are charged with         26  managing the risk, they are more accepting of  higher levels of risk. Where this trust is absent,  stakeholders demand higher levels of safety,  and may refuse to accept any risk at all.   The development of trust between stakeholder  and decision-maker is only one of the benefits of  an effective communication process.  Stakeholders are often the source of information  critical to the decision-process.     For example, during a prolonged  extreme heat episode, a municipality  issued instructions through the Chief of  Police that people who were suffering  heat stress effects should report to the  local militia armouries for help.  Very few  people showed up even though there  was a lot of evidence to suggest that  many citizens were suffering.     The Mayor had a new announcement  put out through the city’s Medical Officer  of Health for people with heat stress to  come to the local high school for help.   Most affected citizens responded  positively to this announcement.    The communication process is necessary so  that information may be passed effectively from  the risk management team to stakeholders. The  same process is used to evaluate stakeholder  acceptance of risk.  Sometimes stakeholders  just want to be involved in the decision process  so that they can monitor the performance of the  decision-maker and to see what is going on.  Again, by involving stakeholders "who just want  to watch" provides the decision-maker with the  opportunity to build trust with these  stakeholders.        27  Annex 2:  Terms Used in this  Guide     The following definitions apply to the terms used  in this Guidebook.  The definitions are drawn  from the Canadian standard “Risk Management:  Guidelines for Decision-Makers” (CAN/CSA- Q850-97) unless otherwise specified.

(UNFCCC)   Consequences – Risk is often expressed as the  product of the consequences flowing from an  event and the frequency of the event.  In this  manual, we use the term “impacts” for  consistency with the terminology of climate  change.   Dialogue – a process for two-way  communication that fosters shared  understanding. It is supported by information.   Hazard – a source of potential harm, or a  situation with a potential for causing harm, in  terms of human injury; damage to health,  property, the environment, and other things of  value; or some combination of these.   Hazard identification – the process of  recognizing that a hazard exists and defining its  characteristics.   IPCC – Intergovernmental Panel on Climate  Change.  A large (several thousand) group of  qualified experts which reviews and assesses  periodically, all climate change research  published in many countries.   Impact – Something that logically or naturally  follows from an action or condition related to  climate change or climate variability.   Kyoto Protocol – an agreement (1997) under  the UNFCCC by most countries of the world, by  which most developed countries will begin to  limit their greenhouse gas emissions by 2008 to  2012.

This includes information  on the risks, decisions, stakeholder views,  meetings and other information that may be of  value.   Risk management – the systematic application  of management policies, procedures, and  practices to the tasks of analysing, evaluating,  controlling, and communicating about risk  issues.   Risk perception – the significance assigned to  risks by stakeholders. This perception is derived  from the stakeholders' expressed needs, issues,  and concerns.   Risk scenario – a defined sequence of events  with an associated frequency or probability and  consequences.   Stakeholder – any individual, group, or  organisation able to affect, be affected by, or  believe it might be affected by, a decision or  activity.  The decision-makers are also  stakeholders.   Stakeholder analysis – Identification of  individuals or groups who are likely to have an  interest in the risk management issue including  a consideration of what their needs issues and  concerns would be and how the stakeholder  should be included in the process.   TAR – Third Assessment Report of the IPCC   UNFCCC – United Nations Framework  Convention on Climate Change (1992)   Vulnerability – the degree to which a system is  susceptible to, or unable to cope with, adverse  effects of climate change, including climate  variability and extremes.  Vulnerability is the  function of the character, size, and rate of  climate variation to which a system is exposed,  its sensitivity, and its adaptive capacity.
