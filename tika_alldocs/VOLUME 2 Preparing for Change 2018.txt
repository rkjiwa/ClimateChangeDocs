74              1 | P a g e    PREFACE   There is scientific certainty that due to global emissions of greenhouse gases our planet is already changing and  will continue to change - in some cases dramatically.  How global warming will affect the climate and weather  patterns across Canada is complicated by the vast landscapes that comprise our nation, and the complex array of  direct and indirect effects that are already anticipated.  Our uncertain future should compel professionals and  decision-makers to be better informed and more capable of making effective and insightful decisions.    Our hope for a stable and sustainable future action requires action be taken today. Whether the goal is to reduce  the emissions that are warming the planet, or to prepare society for anticipated changes, efforts towards  mitigation and adaptation must begin now.  Everyone is responsible, everyone needs to act.     The PRIMERs are provided in a four-volume set.  PRIMER ONE summarizes the science on climate weather and  change.  PRIMER TWO provides information on how individuals, communities and organizations can begin now to  prepare for anticipated changes.  PRIMER THREE presents planning and design tools, existing and emerging, that  can help in the creation of resilient and prosperous communities and sustainable ecosystems.  PRIMER FOUR  summarizes approaches and tools focused on one of the fastest emerging challenges – rising water levels.     The Primers are intended to augment your basic understanding of the science on global warming and climate  change, to provide improved access to information on anticipated impacts to Canadian landscapes, and to promote  improved understanding of the options available to society through adaptive planning for change.  Should you wish  to expand your understanding on the topics discussed, access the materials referenced in the Additional Readings  and Resources on the Web, and reach out to do your own search for newer information.  Climate adaptation is a  rapidly evolving knowledge area.    The Primers rely on two categories of information: reports and papers that have been freely distributed on the  internet; and a selection of books and peer-reviewed papers.  Many of the reports and books referenced are  available from public or university libraries.  Should the URLs provided for material available on the internet  become inactive, it could mean only that the material has been moved, not that it is outdated or no longer relevant.   We encourage you to search by author and/or title to find the document.     Peer reviewed papers are included here because they are an important source of information on climate change  science, mitigation and adaptation, and the first access point for new knowledge.  Some journal papers are  provided freely on the Internet.  Unfortunately, digital access to other journals requires paid subscriptions, or  individual papers can be purchased on-line.  Most university libraries in Canada provide memberships to the public  for a nominal annual fee, but not all may include access to online journals.  However, in addition to borrowing  texts, hard and/or electronic copies of many journals can be viewed at the library.  Readers can also become  members of local, regional, or national communities of practice, where enrollment and access to many valuable  sources of information are freely provided.         PRIMER ONE:    CLIMATE, WEATHER AND CHANGE   Chapters One and Two provide users with a summary   of the current science on global warming, and the   current and projected future changes in weather and   climate throughout Canada.  Chapter Three   summarizes current thinking on the effects   anticipated environmental change will have on   ecosystems, on society and on local as well as   regional economics.     PRIMER TWO:    PREPARING FOR CHANGE   Chapter Four focusses on managing risk and   understanding the role played in decision-making by   uncertainty.  Chapter Five outlines the need to   change what we do, to mitigate and to adapt.    Chapter Six provides direction for those seeking a   better future, incorporating existing instruments and   tools with emerging principles and processes for   guiding change.   PRIMER THREE:   CREATING RESILIENT COMMUNITIES   Chapter Seven summarizes opportunities to create   resilient communities that integrate with their natural   environment and promote well being and   sustainability for humans and ecosystems.    PRIMER FOUR:   FACING RISING WATERS   Chapter Eight examines preventative and protective   measures to rising water, whether it is fresh water   (overland flooding) or the result of rising sea levels   and/or storm surges.       2 | P a g e    4 MANAGING RISK AND UNCERTAINTY  4.1 UNDERSTANDING RISK   Understanding the risks associated with a changing climate is one of the more complicated elements of planning  for adaptation (Figure 4-1).  Risk is the combination of a range of factors that include the hazard itself, the severity  of impacts that could result, the exposure, vulnerability and sensitivity of the asset, and the value that asset has to  the community, the individual and the environment.  Risks associated with climate change alter over time, and as  new and potentially unanticipated impacts manifest.                                 FIGURE 4-1:  RISK associated with climate-related impacts   is a product of the interaction of the hazards, vulnerability   and exposure of human and natural systems. Changes in   both the climate system (left) and in related socioeconomic   processes (right) are drivers of hazards, exposure, and   vulnerability. (Adapted from: Field et al. 2014, Figure TS.1,   p.37).    RISK:  The probability of occurrence of hazardous   events or trends multiplied by the impacts if these   events or trends occur.  Risk is also influenced by how   it is perceived.    (Adapted from Black et al. 2010, p 28; Field et al. 2014,   p39-40; IPCC 2014, p5).     3 | P a g e    The IPCC (2014 Summary for Policy makers (IAV)) has identified five categories of risk important to people, to economies and/or to ecosystems:    1. The risk of global aggregate impacts resulting from additional warming of the planet (i.e., 1–2°C) resulting in changes to biodiversity and to the global economy.  Warming  above this level is anticipated to result in extensive impacts to biodiversity with associated losses in ecosystem goods and services.  Aggregate economic damage is  anticipated to accelerate as temperatures increase.    2. The risk of damage from increasingly frequent and/or severe extreme weather events (e.g., extreme heat, precipitation, drought, inland and coastal flooding).    3. The risk of damage to unique and threatened systems (e.g., communities, cultures, ecosystems) whose sustainability may be further compromised by pressures resulting  from a changing climate.  Vulnerable components of human society may be increasingly stressed by changes in well-being associated with periods of extreme heat or cold,  with damages to infrastructure and with changes to economic conditions.  Species and ecosystems that have only limited capacity to absorb impacts or to adapt to changing  environmental parameters, will be at increasingly higher risk, especially if temperatures continue to warm above 2°.   4. As the planet warms, some physical components of  the environment, as well as some ecosystems may be at  risk of abrupt and irreversible change.  The risks of such  large-scale singular events intensify as alterations to  systems approach thresholds and tipping points.     5. The risk of uneven distribution of impacts in  populations with decreased opportunities for migration  and/or in those dependent on diminished or more  locally expensive supplies for food and water.      Responding to climate-related risks will necessitate that we  make astute decisions in an ever-changing changing world.   Uncertainty over the scope, severity and timing of impacts  will continue, requiring iterative processes to scope and  analyze the kinds and level of risk, as well as a continuous re- evaluation of responses (Figure 4-2).  While avoidance of  situations that create risk will be the ultimate goal, the reality  is that society will need to become increasingly comfortable  with the prospect of managing rather than resolving risk.       FIGURE 4-2:  The IPCC recognizes climate-change adaptation as an iterative risk management process with multiple   feedbacks.  The process and its products are shaped by the people who participate and the values and knowledge   base they rely upon (Adapted from IPCC 2014, p9).     4 | P a g e    4.1.1 MANAGING RISK   Risk management is a multi-step, iterative process that  assesses risk, promotes measures to reduce vulnerabilities to  risk, and monitors and evaluates the effectiveness of those  actions. (Figure 4-3).  Residual risks remain when there is no  physical, practical and/or fiscally acceptable mechanism to  avoid or reduce an effect of climate change (e.g., loss of  historic sites to sea-level rise).     Risk assessment begins with the collection of data on  anticipated hazards.  Analysis of the available data enables  early identification of anticipated effects and provides the  groundwork for estimating the potential for damage or harm  to individuals, populations, property and the environment.   Risk estimation uses models and alternative scenarios to  project anticipated future conditions and to improve  understanding of the probability of occurrence of one or  more risks.  Estimates of risk are at their most effective when  they allow for changes to local conditions over time.  Risk  evaluation relies on this information to evaluate risks against  the potential costs, and benefits to ecosystems and society.     Risk assessment can be guided by these basic principles (King  et al. 2015):    RISK MANAGEMENT:  The systematic application of   management policies, procedures and practices to the   tasks of analyzing, evaluating, controlling, and   communicating about risk issues.     RISK ANALYSIS:  The use of information to identify   hazards and to estimate the chance for, and the severity of,   injury or loss to individuals, populations, property, the   environment and other assets of value.     RISK ESTIMATION:  Examination of the probability and   consequence of alternative risk scenarios, allowing for   changes in parameters over time.    RISK EVALUATION:  An examination of risks in the context   of costs and benefits, and the acceptability of the risk as   determined by the needs, issues, and concerns of   stakeholders.   RISK ASSESSMENT:  The overall process of risk analysis,   risk estimation and risk evaluation.   RESIDUAL RISK:  The risk that remains after all adaptation   measures and control strategies have been applied.   (Adapted from APEGGA 2006, p4; Black et al. 2010, p 28)  FIGURE 4-3:  Illustration of a risk management   process    4. Use the best available information, whether it consists of current science or   is based on expert judgment.  Even where deep uncertainty exists, risk estimates   based on available information, are better than no estimate at all.   5. Include as many factors as feasible.  Complex systems and issues can defy   prediction (e.g., human behaviour), and resist simplification.  Risks must be   assessed across changing spatial dimensions and over a range of time periods.     Development of a range of plausible scenarios will help to conceptualize possible   future states and proactive responses.    6. Document where you use value judgments.  Many conclusions in risk   management are inherently subjective whether dealing with what constitutes a   risk (i.e. what it is that we might wish to avoid) or deciding how much we care   about it.  Describing the values and opinions used ensures that others can apply   different values as appropriate (Table 4-1).  Assessment of the likelihood of a risk   occurring should strive to be objective, based on the best available   information/science.   1. Link risks to objectives.  Objectives can be general (e.g., human prosperity  and security), or specific (e.g., keeping residential properties dry).  They  identify risks to be avoided, working also to estimate probability of occurrence.     2. Identify the largest risks first.  The more a risk could affect the objectives,  the more relevance it will have for decision-making.  Larger risks are those  which are most likely to occur, those with the greatest impact, or those which  fall somewhere in between.  Risks should include both short-term events and  long-term changes.    3. Consider all probabilities. Low probability high impact risks (e.g., flooding  from a 100-year storm event) should not be ignored, or down-graded, at a time  when established best practice for return periods of severe weather will  increasingly become irrelevant. When probability cannot be meaningfully  quantified, consider the ‘plausible worst case’ scenario. The relevant threshold  for plausibility will most likely be a matter of judgement, significantly affected  by threats to human health and well-being.      5 | P a g e    Information generated by risk assessment processes is invaluable to the determination of the most effective  measures to avoid risks, and to reduce risks.  When examining hazards, evaluation of impacts must take a broad  and holistic approach to identify not just the primary issues of concern, but to ensure that indirect as well as direct  risks are identified.  Similarly, when considering measures to avoid or reduce risk in one area, it is important to  assess the potential that such actions could change local conditions and/or increase risks to other assets.  Managing  risk must also be framed to address multiple hazards and changing conditions over time.     Risk evaluation is shaped by knowledge, especially critical information on the potential risk of damage to assets  and individuals.  It is also greatly affected by how much risk can be avoided altogether through proactive measures  (e.g., moving at-threat structures out of potential flood-up areas).     Some measures must be given priority over other actions, primarily due to the potential for impact to important  assets and to human health and safety (Figure 4-4).  Other first priorities could include actions often referred to as  low-hanging fruit, and include situations where most participants can agree, costs to implement are low, and  benefits are readily seen.  In general, high priority, and low-hanging fruit responses can be the easiest on which to  gain agreement and to act, but risk management processes can be dominated by more thorny issues that reflect  conflicting perspectives, differing values and/or opposing views as to priorities and potential actions.        IDENTIFYING RISKS (adapted from   GOV/CAN/NS 2011)   • What climate change and/or severe weather   effects have you already experienced?   • What kinds of events caused these issues   (e.g., storms, high tides, heat or cold)?   • What kinds of measures (if any) were   undertaken to respond to these issues?   • How well prepared are you for such events,   especially if they become more frequent or   more severe?    • Do you have the capacity/resources to   withstand the next event, if it occurs soon?   • How often have these events occurred (e.g.,   rarely, occasionally, frequently)?   • Did the event affect a significant area,   population or necessary service?     • Was the impact large or small?    • Can you describe and record the range of   issues that occurred because of this event?     • Will these types of events and associated   hazards continue?  Become more   problematic?   • What contributing factors may result in   these events becoming more of a problem   over time (e.g., new development in low   lying areas, aging infrastructure, vulnerable   population)?    • What other sorts of climate related issues do   you anticipate will occur in the future?  Are   these new effects?   • Do you anticipate the development of new   opportunities as the climate changes?   • What information do you need to plan   effectively for the future?   • Do you have access to this information?    • Do you have the resources to create the   needed information?

Integration will ensure that adaptation measures are  acceptable across the broadest array of assets and  uses and may stimulate potential benefits as knock- on effects of change (e.g., improvements to  waterfront protection from sea-level rise could be a  starting point for rejuvenation of aging infrastructure  and re-vitalization of a space as a public use area).     And finally, risk management processes must accept  that even in those situations where significant efforts  and funds are expended to reduce risks, there will be  situations where risk cannot be avoided, and where  disaster readiness and response remain as an  important component of risk management measures.   This is especially true of risks associated with climate  change, as future conditions are an evolving reality,  and some risks to assets and to individuals cannot be  entirely avoided.  Ensuring that systems are as ready  for severe events as is practical, and that  communities and individuals are informed and  prepared for disaster conditions will be key to  damage reduction and to protection of life and well- being.                        FIGURE 4-4:  Risk evaluation categories based in severity of impact and frequency or probability (adapted from Black et al. 2010).     7 | P a g e    4.1.2 VALUES AND JUDGEMENTS   Early involvement of stakeholders is an important criterion for success in risk assessment and risk management.   Ready access to current science and emerging information will maximize the opportunities for stakeholders to  become informed on the threats and opportunities associated with the changing climate.  While an increasing array  of tools is being developed specifically to quantifiably express risk, and to determine risk management priorities,  much decision-making ultimately comes down to value judgements.  Personal perspectives can affect a range of  decision-making, but the most contentious and often the most important value judgements include (King et al.  2015):    • value for human life;    • aversion to inequality in society;    • the impacts to future generations; and    • tolerance for risk in any form.   Ultimately, most risk management decision-making is based not on what is practically possible, but on what can be  accepted as appropriate and just, given the circumstances.  Human tolerance for risk is largely a product of an  individual’s, a group’s or a society’s willingness to live with certain risks, in order to secure benefits, as long as they  believe the risks to have been based on good science, and the benefits and potential costs have been well defined  and communicated.  When assigning degrees of severity of risk and impact, more objective criteria (e.g., financial  costs associated with damages) can be used, but human perspectives and values will still play a significant role in  determining the level of tolerance for the unavoidable risk (Table 4-2, Figure 4-5).     TOLERABLE LEVEL OF RISK:  The tolerable level   of risk is drawn from a range of values and   standards including government regulations,   industry standards, best practices by industry, and   a qualitative assessment by stakeholders of what   is fair and reasonable.  Toleration does not   necessarily mean that the risk is negligible or   acceptable.  Toleration is a willingness to live with   risk to secure benefits (e.g., continuing to live near   the shore) and in the confidence that the risk is   well defined, monitored and managed. (Adapted   from APEGGA 2006, p4).   STAKEHOLDERS/ACTORS:   Any person, group, or   organization that can affect, be affected by, or   believe that they might be affected by a decision   or activity related to the risk assessment (e.g.,   property owners, residents, decision makers,   government regulators, senior professionals,   project managers, technical experts, regulatory   agencies, special interest groups, and the public at   large.

Recently it has been reported that many of the supposed  independent reviews on climate science, that fueled the dialogue about uncertainty, were  funded by companies from the oil and gas sector, some of whom are alleged to have been  informed decades ago by their own internal research staff of the dangers posed to the  planet by fossil fuels combustion.  There is no uncertainty over whether the planet is  warming, there are only degrees of certainty for scientists working on the scope and timing  of anticipated impacts to weather and to climate.  Certainty is derived from the confidence  scientists have in the validity of their conclusions.  Confidence requires reliable data,  objective and replicable evaluation of the evidence, and the support of other credible  experts in the field.  Levels of confidence are expressed qualitatively (Table 4-3).     When the IPCC (Field et al. 2014) presents its key findings, the degrees of certainty it  reports are based on:    • confidence in the validity of a finding, based on the type, amount, quality, and  consistency of the evidence (e.g., data, mechanistic understanding, theory,  models, expert judgment) and the degree of agreement among researchers; and    • measures of uncertainty in a finding, expressed probabilistically (based on  statistical analysis of observations or model results, or both, and expert  judgment).     When the IPCC reports that there is High Confidence in a conclusion, it means that there  is a significant body of data, that many independent studies have produced the same  results, and that there is a high degree of consensus among researchers (Figure 4-6).    In some circumstances the discussion around certainty has fueled somewhat wishful  thinking on the immediacy or severity of impacts from climate change.  When issues are  discussed within a context where there is certainty regarding the impact, but an as yet  undetermined time frame in which the impact will manifest, there is greater potential for  pragmatic assessment of adaptation issues and options (Ballard and Lewandowsky 2015).          FIGURE 4-6:  The relationship of confidence to evidence and agreement statements.   Generally, evidence is most robust when there are multiple, consistent independent   lines of high-quality evidence (Adapted from Field et al. 2014, Figure 1, p 41.   The degree of certainty is based on the type,   amount, quality, and consistency of evidence   (e.g., data, information, theory, models, expert   judgment) and the degree of agreement   amongst experts.   (IPCC 2014)   TABLE 4-3:  Basis for confidence levels as determined by the body of evidence and the   consensus amongst experts (Burkett and Davidson 2012).   CONFIDENCE   LEVEL  BASIS FOR THE DETERMINATION   HIGH   There is strong evidence based on established theory,   multiple sources, consistent results, reliable,   documented methodologies acceptable to science, and   a high consensus amongst researchers.   MODERATE   There is moderate evidence based on multiple sources,   with some consistency in approach, methods and   findings and a medium level of consensus on   conclusions.   FAIR   There is evidence derived from few sources, with limited   consistency across the studies, incomplete models,   and/or based on emerging but not yet proven   methodologies, possibly resulting in competing schools   of thought.   LOW   Inconclusive evidence, derived from limited sources, or   dependent on extrapolations, inconsistent conclusions,   poor documentation and/or untested or questionable   methodologies that demonstrate disagreement among   experts, or a lack of opinions provided by the scientific   community.        10 | P a g e    Likelihood or probability is the chance that a well-defined outcome has occurred or will occur in the future, and is  based on statistics of past events, or models that predict the potential for future occurrence.  There are a range of  scales in use, most of which mirror to some degree the IPCC mathematical scale (Table 4-4).  Likelihood or  probability are generally only used to express the frequency of occurrence of findings that have been afforded a  high or very high level of confidence                               4.1.4 THE RIGHT TO KNOW   While property owners and the public have the right to know of threats or hazards that affect their assets, their  well-being, or their safety, it is less clear as to when decision-makers have the responsibility to share information  on anticipated changes to environmental conditions (Gibbs and Hill 2011).  For many of us, the risks attached to a  property or to human use of an area or asset have historically been based on when the hazardous event could be  expected to occur again.  By example, having experienced a 100-year storm, property owners would likely see  investment in damage repair as worthwhile, anticipating that it is relatively unlikely that those conditions will re- occur soon.  Their confidence is based on the years of data used to determine the return period for weather events  of such severity.  But in some areas hindsight may no longer be a viable option for anticipating risk of damage, as  water levels rise, and weather intensifies.     If areas are now projected to become more prone to overland flooding (e.g., because of cloudburst precipitation,  storm surges, extreme high tides), when should property owners, residents, users, insurers, and financers be  informed of the anticipated changes to threat and to risk?  For many areas in Canada, detailed information on  changes in sea-level rise, or on the potential for inland flooding is either not yet available or has been based on  anticipatory models of a projected future condition.  Decision-makers can be challenged by anticipated conflicts  arising from the devaluation of property situated in newly designated hazard areas, and by the right of insurers  and financers to know all risks and liabilities associated with a property       DESIGN STORMS   Likelihood that something will happen has been an effective tool in planning and design for decades.  Design   storms, which are statistical representations of precipitation and wind events that reflect anticipated conditions   in a specific area, are associated with anticipated return periods (e.g., the likelihood that a 100-year storm will   happen in any year).  In Canada, design storms have been used for years to assist in establishing a basis for   standards of construction for a wide array of water and transportation infrastructure and for buildings.     As conditions change and severe storm events become more frequent, the return period for stronger storms is   decreasing.  What used to be a 100-year storm event may now have occurred twice within a decade.  Science   has had difficulties in responding to these changing realities because data on the frequency of severe storm   events may have changed only over the past decade or so – too short a time frame to be statistically valid.  As   a result, much information on storms remains anecdotal, and accepted best practice for design storm has not   yet been altered for most of the country.

Knowing your contribution to ongoing  changes in the climate and understanding the effects of those changes can be complicated by geographic factors,  operational conditions and by the timing of climate change impacts on your area.  The science on climate change  is improving daily, but there are ongoing issues in mobilizing that knowledge so that it can be timely and useful to  planning and decision-making.  In some circumstances the changing climate will present problems.  In others it will  manifest as new opportunities.     Increasingly climate change is being described as a wicked problem - where the scope and magnitude of impacts  can be difficult to predict; where knowledge is incomplete, where there are multiple perspectives, large costs, and  knock-on effects to inter-linked components of society and the environment.  Wicked problems are not easy to  solve because they resist simplification, because they do not fall easily into established frameworks for problem- solving, because there is often no accepted ‘right’ solution, and because each problem associated with climate  change is unique to local circumstances and local time frames.  Solving wicked problems is best tackled by inter- disciplinary teams, whose members have a willingness to learn by doing, to adapt to changing circumstances, and  to persevere over time.     The best approach for dealing with wicked problems accepts that there are few situations where there is only one  solution.  Traditional approaches to problem-solving are often based on the identification of one preferred  method- which becomes the right method and discarding all other proposals – which become the wrong methods.   Wicked problems are best resolved by taking a clumsy approach (Verweij et al. 2006).  Clumsiness in problem- solving accepts that there are often contradictory opinions, values and perspectives in both describing the problem  and in finding the best pathways towards its resolution.  Unlike much of current thought which requires society to  pick only one option (opinion, perspective, methodology) and discard all others, clumsiness allows for disparate  views and conclusions, the retention of alternatives as plausible options should the preferred solution prove  ineffective, and a continuation of the discourse as new knowledge appears and experience changes perspectives.     Clumsiness as an approach to problem solving works well within an adaptive management framework (Figure 4- 7)– often described as a looped process that depends on learning from experience as a significant component for  forward progress towards a defined or emerging goal.  Adaptive management doesn’t work in every situation and  can be especially frustrating when rapid changes to process are not possible.  However, because it functions even  when there are information shortfalls and uncertainty, it offers an alternative to linear management systems, and  can be effective in fostering resilience, and in building the flexibility to cope with change over time.  Planning and  design for a changing climate needs to be fluid and opportunistic, ready to seize on new opportunities created as  much by an expanding body of knowledge, as by new realities within local and regional environments.  Ingenuity  and innovation must replace best practice options, relying on an evolving understanding of vulnerability, exposure  and risk to aid the development of effective strategies that can adapt over time to continuously changing  conditions.            WICKED PROBLEMS arise from tricky, thorny   issues that can be difficult to isolate from larger   issues and demand ongoing efforts to resolve,   partly because it is difficult to determine when   efforts to resolve the issues have been successful.

Information on climate change is ramping up, but  not all of it is good science.  Even within the professions, individuals may, or may not yet be, well-informed on the  most current predictive models for effects such as sea-level rise, cloud bursts, and/or changing extremes of heat  and cold.  Much of the work to alleviate the effects of a changing environment must deal with an evolving case of  information, and care must be taken to ensure that the information is credible not merely popular.  In a recent  survey of professionals in Canada, a significant proportion identified the media as their most prominent source for  information on climate change.  The media, and especially the internet, can be amazingly efficient methods for  knowledge dissemination.  However, as much information could be derived from sources with no credible  association to science, it is important that users take care in assessing the credentials of sites and of authors.   Information should include:   • The most current and accurate spatial information on topography, land cover, structures and services.   Information on elevation is critical to advance planning for issues ranging from flooding to emergency  response and evacuation routes.    • Historic information on key parameters (e.g., temperature, precipitation) and on seasonal and yearly  climate patterns in the local areas.  In Canada, this data is freely available from Environment Canada, and  can be keyed to specific local areas.  Historic data will assist in building understanding of how changing  conditions will affect the operating normals of ecosystems, habitats and species as well as human systems  such as water supply management, urban forests, and transportation linkages.   • Current data on weather, as well as global projections for change, used to develop a range of possible  scenarios over timelines projected for 10 years, 20 years, 50 years and 100 years keeping in mind that:   • Temperature predictions are more certain than precipitation predictions, which can be influenced by  extreme storm events;   • Current models for changes in climate (e.g. less than five years old) are more likely to reflect current  science and data;   • Projections for future conditions will have a range of degrees of confidence (e.g., more likely than not,  unlikely), and could be significantly affected by exposure to locally confounding factors (i.e., parameters  that can affect local weather, and local environmental conditions such as exposure to active wave energy).         WHAT MAKES A SOURCE CREDIBLE?   Are the authors experts in the field?  Most decisions   should be guided by science-based information   provided by persons with advanced degrees in   related areas of study (e.g., atmospheric science,   chemistry, hydrology, ocean engineering,   oceanography, marine, aquatic, terrestrial ecology,   fisheries, forestry, agriculture).      Has the work been conducted by an established   organization?  Is this a government study, the work   of an established academic team, a collaboration of   scientists, government and/or community   organizations?  Some studies available on-line may   selectively use information to promote an   unsubstantiated point of view.  Even some on-line   journals are more ‘vanity’ publications (i.e., authors   pay to have their work published) than collections   of peer-reviewed science.     Does the information provided in the study make   sense to your situation? While there is much to be   gained from the knowledge and experiences of   others, care must be taken in applying knowledge   gained in other environments, regions and   countries.    How old is the information?  Outdated data on   weather and other environmental conditions must   be viewed as historic artifacts, as conditions   throughout Canada may be changing rapidly.  This   is especially important in the derivation of   statistically based codes for practice such as the   return periods for extreme weather or anticipate   maximum precipitation by season or by month.  As   the science on climate change is quickly evolving,   care should be taken in using information provided   in reports more than five years old.  Reports that   are more than ten years old should be viewed as   historical rather than current.     13 | P a g e    Changes in climate variables can have direct and trickle-down effects on an array of  environmental and social components.  Tracking data on changes in climate, as well as on  resulting effects, and/or the efficacy of response mechanisms, will quickly become numbingly  complex.  Decisions may be made and/or changes based on changing information and the need  for future decision-makers to understand the basis for earlier efforts will become increasingly  important.    To keep track of the basis for decision-making, consider the benefit in developing and updating  a table on data and information sources (Table 4-5).  This will facilitate tracking the information  used for planning and design decisions, and prompt decision-makers to re-examine the  information when up-dating is deemed beneficial.               Finding, collecting and creating needed  information is an important and critical part of   preparing for a changing climate and an altered   environment.

March 2015,   Municipal Planning   Policy Review         14 | P a g e    4.3.1 BUILDING CAPACITY    Given the nature of the changes that are upon us, it is unlikely that all organizations or individuals will have access  to the breadth and scope of expertise in climate change science, mitigation and adaptation that is needed to  holistically aid in decision-making.  Following from the Paris (December 2015) meetings on greenhouse gas  emissions, Canada’s commitments to curbing emissions will require significant change in social, industrial,  commercial and political systems.  Interdisciplinary approaches will be needed to understand all the ramifications  of anticipated environmental change, and to aid in effective planning and managing to reduce our contributions  to greenhouse gas emissions, and to prepare for alterations to our environment.     Within Canada, planning and design professions are aware of the value in using a multi-disciplinary team approach  (e.g., planning, architecture, landscape architecture, engineering, geo-science, ecology) to solving complex  challenges.  Unlike more traditional approaches to problem-solving, climate change will require not only  collaboration across disciplines, but will require each of the professions to learn and to apply gained knowledge to  alter their approach and practice.  There will be fewer opportunities to rely on ‘best practice’ techniques learned  from experience, and a great deal of pressure to be open to new approaches, to risk new methodologies and to  adapt on the fly.  Climate change will also need greater collaboration among related professions (e.g., finance,  insurance, economics, law, sociology, health) if retrofitting, rebuilding and designing new builds to achieve the  highest benefits to todays society and the lowest costs to future generations.    Professions in Canada are already moving to inform members, to adjust standards and to advance knowledge through partnerships with universities, industry, governments  and communities.  These affiliations must cross established barriers, and require tolerance and collaboration among disciplines and individuals, many of whom have had little  experience with each other’s perspectives or needs.  The learning curve will be high for some, but there is an appetite within most sectors of Canada to get on with this job.   The potential benefits of ingenuity and innovation will surpass preparation for the impacts of change, to embrace the creation of new and prosperous human communities  surviving in sustainable landscapes.  The professions, academic and government research, all levels of government, non-government organizations and the private sector have  in recent years built collaborative partnerships to improve local knowledge and to share emerging information and developing tools (Table 4-6).  This two-way transference of  needed expertise and experience, bolsters capacity within communities and organizations, and ensures that research is more engaged in providing timely information and in  advancing needed technology.   The Code of Ethics of Engineers Canada,   like that of most of the planning and   design professions in Canada (e.g.   planners, landscape architects, architects)   requires that all members:   ‘shall hold paramount the safety, health   and welfare of the public, the protection   of the environment and promote health   and safety within the workplace’.

There are many perspectives on the meaning of the terms vulnerability, exposure, sensitivity,  and risk, which can lead to confusion when discussing how a society, an industry or an individual may be harmed  by changes in climate, in weather and in linked and altered environmental conditions.  Similarly, confusion can be  created when explaining how the impacts of climate change may not always result in negative change, but may  create new opportunities for species, ecosystems and society.  It can be relatively simple to comprehend how  unique local conditions in the physical environment and in society will affect not only the hazards created by  climate change but will also contribute to the breadth and scope of exposure.  People who are socially,  economically, culturally, politically, institutionally, or otherwise marginalized can be especially vulnerable to  change, and may be further marginalized by some proposals for mitigation and/or adaptation (Figure 4-8).   Heightened vulnerability is rarely the result of a single factor but is often caused by multiple conditions such as the  location of impoverished populations in areas more prone to flooding, or the inability of elders to effectively cope  with periods of extreme heat.  Overall, vulnerability should be seen as resulting from the combination of exposure  to hazards, the sensitivity of the affected element of the environment and/or society to change, and the capacity  of those affected to cope with change.               HAZARD: The potential occurrence of a natural or   human-induced physical event or trend or   physical impact that may cause loss of life, injury,   or other health impacts, as well as damage and   loss to property, infrastructure, livelihoods, service   provision, ecosystems, and environmental   resources.    EXPOSURE:  The presence of people, livelihoods,   species or ecosystems, environmental functions,   services, and resources, infrastructure, or   economic, social, or cultural assets in places and   settings that could be adversely affected.   VULNERABILITY:  The propensity or   predisposition to be adversely affected.    Vulnerability encompasses a variety of concepts   and elements including sensitivity or susceptibility   to harm and lack of capacity to cope and adapt.   IMPACTS:  The effects on natural and/or human   systems. (e.g., lives, livelihoods, health,   ecosystems, economies, societies, cultures,   services, and infrastructure) due to the interaction   of climate changes or hazardous climate events   occurring within a specific time period and the   vulnerability of an exposed society or system.    SENSITIVITY:  The degree to which a system is   affected either adversely or beneficially by climate   variability or change.    (Adapted from Field et al. 2014, p39-40; IPCC 2007,   p726; IPCC 2014, p5).   FIGURE 4-8:  As portrayed by the IPCC, multidimensional vulnerability in society is the result of intersecting dimensions of inequality.  Vulnerability   increases when people’s capacities and opportunities to adapt and to adjust are diminished (Field et al. 2014, Box TS.4, Figure 1, P 49).     16 | P a g e    4.4.1 ADAPTIVE CAPACITY   The capacity to cope with hazards determines the sensitivity  of the system and the individual to impact and affects  whether the impact results in positive or negative change.   Understanding the adaptive capacity of a community, a  segment of society, or an individual is a necessary element in  the design and implementation of effective adaptation  strategies.  Adaptive capacity is also a determining factor in  the interest and ability of sectors and organizations to take  advantage of the opportunities which may present  themselves as the climate changes (e.g., longer growing  seasons for crop species, improved tourism assets, deeper  port waters).     Thresholds (e. g., flood levels, high and low temperature  extremes, concentrations of salt in drinking water) represent  that point after which some significant change in local  conditions will occur.  With a changing climate, it is extremely  important to understand that thresholds will alter  significantly over time.  Mean sea levels will continue to rise,  making low-lying assets increasingly vulnerable to flooding  and to storm damage.  Higher and lower temperatures will  affect growing conditions for crops, increase the potential  for nitrification in nearshore marine waters, and create  dangerous living conditions for the very young, infirm and  older members of human society.  In planning for change, it  will be important to know, and to track important thresholds.   As conditions change, even before thresholds are exceeded,  systems and individuals may be increasingly altered and then  catastrophically transformed into a different state – one that  may be permanent - once tipping points are reached (Figure  4-9).    Tipping points and other limits can be a factor in the adaptive  capacity of human society.  Opportunities and resources to  adapt may in fact be limited for some, affecting their  perception of tolerable risk (Dow et al., 2013).             ADAPTIVE CAPACITY:  The ability or potential of a system to respond successfully to climate variability   and change, including adjustments in both behaviour and in resources and technologies.     THRESHOLD:  The stage of an ecological, social, economic or other system or process at which sudden or   rapid change occurs.     TIPPING POINT:  The point after which recovery is unlikely and the system is transformed to an altered   state.     TRANSFORMATION:  A change in the fundamental attributes of natural and human systems that may   reflect a neutral change, a positive change or a negative change to an altered state. A transformation could   also reflect strengthened, altered, or aligned paradigms, goals, or values towards promoting adaptation   for sustainable development, including poverty reduction.

Currently, more conservative models of future change  rely upon a slowing, or elimination of new emissions (Figure 5-1).  Less optimistic models are based on potentially  more realistic changes in human contributions, anticipating that while emission levels may decrease from current  loadings, they will continue.  Current concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere have already  passed the 400-ppm threshold (as compared to pre-industrial era concentrations that have been estimated at 280  ppm).  Concentrations of carbon this high have not occurred for at least 800,000 years.  There are considerable  concerns amongst scientists that CO2 concentrations in excess of 450 ppm may create a world much different than  we have today.    Average air temperatures across the globe have increased by almost one degree Celsius from pre-industrial  averages.  Given the levels of greenhouse gases ALREADY in the atmosphere, the planet will warm at least another  1.5 °C, even if we stopped all emissions immediately.  Warming in excess of 2 °C is anticipated to result in dramatic  changes to environments and to society.  Added to these concerns is an increasing understanding that global  warming is not a linear process.  One effect leads to another.  Rising temperatures in the Arctic and thawing  permafrost will increase the volume of methane contributed to the atmosphere, accelerating warming.              FIGURE 5-1:  Four scenarios for atmospheric   concentrations of CO2 (measured in parts per million or   ppm) projected for the period 2000-2100.  The scenarios   range from low to high emissions (intensive reduction   efforts as compared to limited reduction efforts) (van   Vuuren et al. 2011).   “…we have the means to limit climate change and its risks, with many solutions that   allow for continued economic and human development.  However, stabilizing   temperature increase to below 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels will require an   urgent and fundamental departure from business as usual.  Moreover, the longer we   wait to act, the more it will cost and the greater the technological, economic, social   and institutional challenges we will face.” (IPCC 2014a Synthesis Report, p v).     23 | P a g e    Unless greater efforts are made worldwide to reduce carbon emissions, scenarios  for global warming that place concentrations of carbon dioxide somewhere  between 500-700 ppm by 2100 become more likely.  As the atmosphere  continues to heat up, the future stability of the West Antarctic ice sheet becomes  more uncertain, and there is a greater potential for relative sea levels that are  significantly higher than those on current planning agendas.  Changes to climate  and weather patterns will also continue, increasing in severity over time.   Decision-makers should by now be aware that rising seas are already affecting  coastal water levels, and that projected increases in sea levels will continue PAST  the 2100 threshold, which marks only the first 100 years of shifting conditions  (Figure 5-2).     While it is true that many of today’s decision-makers may not in their lifetimes be  severely affected by the impacts of a changing climate, future generations will  bear the burdens created by inaction during our watch.   Already climate change  is predicted to result in more severe weather events, occurring across larger  areas.  Additional stresses to unique and to already threatened species, habitats  and ecosystems may result in increased extinctions and irreversible and  potentially negative changes in the landscape.  Rising seas will significantly alter  conditions along Canadian coasts, especially in the East where rising sea level will  be exacerbated by land subsidence in some areas of the coast.  While much has  been said to date about sea levels that rise as much as one metre, less is being  reported about long-term concerns.  Even with significant reductions in  emissions, seas will continue to rise throughout this century.  Without reductions,  the projected longer-term changes will be much more severe (Nicholls et al.  2011).      Never before in human history has the future been so reliant on what civilization  does today.  We may not be able to reverse the processes we have set in motion,  reducing emissions, but improving atmospheric conditions and planning for  future changes will do much to reduce or slow the pace of changes, to improve  the quality of life, and increase the options for sustainability available to the  generations to come.                     FIGURE 5-2:  Projected global sea-level rise for the period 2100 to 2500, showing a range of   scenarios based on anticipated concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide in 2100 (James et al   2014, p20).   “What is the use of having developed a   science well enough to make predictions if,   in the end, all we are willing to do is stand   around and wait for them to come   through?”  (Nobel Laureate, F. Sherwood Rowland, a pioneer in  the field of ozone depletion. 1996 Interview with the non-profit   organization Climate Communication).     24 | P a g e    5.2 WHAT IS MITIGATION?   The IPCC has continued to emphasize the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, as the primary effort towards  slowing or possibly reversing the planet’s change in climate.  Human efforts to reduce the sources, or to enhance  the sinks of greenhouse gases are often referred to collectively as ‘mitigation’.  Mitigation efforts generally have  two thrusts: reduction of greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere (to change the Earth’s radiative balance  and reduce the effects of greenhouse warming), and removal of existing carbon dioxide or other GHGs from the  atmosphere (e.g., through land management, reforestation, ocean iron fertilization).     Reduction in greenhouse gas emissions can too often be seen to be a problem for big industry, where the largest  changes in total emissions could be accomplished.  However, greenhouse gas reduction is a broader problem that  requires all individuals and sectors of society to participate in its solution through personal and organizational  commitment to change.  Much can be done to reduce demands for energy for transportation, heating, cooling and  industry operations, to facilitate the move to alternative, sustainable forms of energy generation (e.g., solar, wind,  tidal) and to become more efficient in our use of energy to serve societal needs.     The IPCC (2014a) reports that urbanization is a growing trend throughout the world, with more than 52% of the  global population already resident in urban areas.  Urban populations are expected to account for as much as 69%  of the world’s people by 2050, which is only 35 years away.  In rapidly urbanizing area, large gains in GHG reduction  can be achieved where innovation in policy and practice alter traditional development and building patterns.   Efficiencies in technology and modifications to human behaviour can significantly reduce human demands on  energy and for consumer goods and services.  Waste reduction, together with recycling initiatives, can ensure more  efficient use and recovery of existing resources, including energy.  Retrofit of existing structures, and sustainable  design requirements for new buildings can reduce energy requirements for heating and cooling especially where  structures can and will represent long-term, locked-in demands on resources.  Innovations in the design and  construction of new buildings would increase passive measures to aid heating and cooling, and result in overall  reduction in energy demands.  Within urban areas, tree canopy can contribute not only to removal of GHGs, but  also to overall improvements in air quality and reduction in urban heat islands.  While many cities throughout the  world are now addressing planning for climate change, few have taken a comprehensive look at their existing and  potential future land use planning strategies, especially on measures that reduce sprawl, create sustainable  neighbourhoods, and promote public transit.    Mitigation efforts should not overlook the gains to be made from the removal of GHGs from the atmosphere  through innovations in agriculture, reforestation and sustainable management of existing forested lands.   Agricultural practices that rely on improvements in cropland and grazing land management, and the restoration of  organic soil management are cost-effective mitigation options.  Reforestation, which has the potential to create  substantial sinks for carbon sequestering, can also reduce heating of the earth’s surface, improve water storage  and water quality, and reduce the potential for soil erosion and landslides   ‘MITIGATION’, in the context of climate change, is   a human intervention to reduce the sources or   enhance the sinks of greenhouse gases (GHGs).   IPCC 2014b, p4   Mitigation efforts can mean switching to   renewable energy sources, employing   new technology and/or retrofitting   older equipment to reduce emissions,   changing planning and management   policies, and altering societal   behaviour.  Mitigation also includes   efforts to expand forests or to enhance   other mechanisms that remove CO2 from   the atmosphere.   THE UNITED NATIONS FRAMEWORK CONVENTION ON CLIMATE CHANGE (UNFCCC)   The ultimate objective is to achieve “stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference   with the climate system. Such a level should be achieved within a time frame sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change, to ensure that food   production is not threatened and to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner”. (IPCC 2014b, p4; UNFCCC: Available at: http://bigpicture.unfccc.int/ ).   http://bigpicture.unfccc.int/   25 | P a g e    5.2.1 CANADA’S EFFORTS TO  REDUCE EMISSIONS   Canada’s greenhouse gas emissions are predominantly the result of the manufacturing and  consumption of fossil fuels to provide energy for transportation, electricity, heating,  manufacturing, construction and mining (Table 5-1).  While in the past few years, some  reductions in greenhouse gas emissions have been achieved, Canada is a long way from its  stated goals.     When total contributions are compared, Alberta, Ontario and Quebec contribute most of the  emissions (Figure 5-3).  Most of the provinces and territories are reducing their carbon dioxide  (CO2) emissions, with Ontario demonstrating the greatest change.  Alberta is noteworthy as its  contributions have risen (GOV/CAN/ECCC 2018), largely related to their oil and gas sector,  which produced energy for use by the rest of the country.  Canadian provinces and territories,  which have developed a range of approaches and policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions  (Figures 5-4, 5-5) (Holmes et al. 2012), have together with the federal government, recently  engaged in collaborative discussions towards a more common reduction strategy and  alternative options.                           FIGURE 5-3:  Greenhouse gas emissions by province and territory, Canada, 2005, 2010 and 2016 (GOV/CAN/ECCC 2018).   “…Canada intends to achieve   an economy-wide target to   reduce our greenhouse gas   emissions by 30% below 2005   levels by 2030.” (GOV/CAN 2015)   How are we as a   nation going to make   that happen?

The challenge to keep global warming below 2° Celsius is constrained by the fact that the IPCC estimates 65% of the carbon budget needed to attain  that goal has already been used.  To come close to attaining the carbon goals, a significant proportion of the oil and gas reserves will have to remain in the ground as ‘unburnable  carbon’.  It has been estimated that globally a third of oil reserves, half of gas reserves, and 80 percent of coal reserves should remain unused, unless a method for carbon  recapture is developed (Figure 5-6).  For Canada, these estimates translate into 74% of oil reserves, 24% of gas reserves and 75% of coal reserves.  Extraction of oil from open  pit mining of natural bitumen drops to negligible after 2020 because of the costs of production (McGlade and Ekins 2015).     For communities, businesses and individuals, the challenges are two-fold.  As policies to reduce dependencies on carbon-based fuels are implemented, investment in some  carbon industries may face increasing risks of becoming stranded, (e.g., a loss of value, or increased potential for liabilities long before their expected economic life).  Falling  prices for oil and gas, a switch to alternative energy products, and reduced demands resulting from efficiencies in consumption and changes in consumer behaviour can  significantly affect the viability of traditional carbon industries, the communities that are dependent upon them and the industries that rely upon carbon consumption as one  of the foundations for their sector (e.g., international tourism). Alternatively, communities and sectors that divest themselves of dependencies on GHC-producing forms of  energy, face challenges related to reducing energy demands, moving to alternative fuels, and improving well-being through direct and passive adaptation such as improved  public transportation, and measures to increase sheltering of buildings.

As evidence of an already changing climate begins to amass, governments,  communities and organizations have increasingly focussed on the need to  plan for adaptation to both short and long-term environmental change.   Adaptation is often seen as a social, economic and political process of  adjustment to the actual or anticipated effects of climate change on human  systems (Adger et al. 2005; Burkett and Davidson 2012; Bassett and  Fogelman 2013; Fazey et al. 2015).  But there are many definitions.     Adaptation is also an ecological process whereby species and habitats change  to absorb effects, or move to an altered state, which may or may not affect  the reliability of some ecosystem services.  In human systems, adaptation  efforts seek to reduce vulnerability, to moderate or avoid harm, to enhance  resilience to existing or anticipated change, and to position society so as to  be better prepared to exploit new and beneficial opportunities.  In some  natural systems, human intervention in adaptation may facilitate the  adjustment of ecosystems to anticipated changes in climate conditions and  its effects.     Planning for adaptation (Burkett and Davidson 2012, p xviii) is the result of  “a deliberate policy decision based on an awareness that conditions have  changed, or are about to change, and that action is required to return to, to  maintain, or to achieve a desired state”.                                       “ADAPTATION is an iterative risk management process that relies on multiple feedback   loops as new information is acquired.  The process is evolutionary, shaped by people   and knowledge, and the outcomes of practice”.  (IPCC 2014a, p9).   “ADAPTATION: The process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects.   In human systems, adaptation seeks to moderate or avoid harm, or exploit beneficial   opportunities. In some natural systems, human intervention may facilitate adjustment to   expected climate and its effects.” (Field et al. 2014. p40).   ADAPTATION is not one activity or decision, but “a continuous stream of activities,   actions, decisions and attitudes that informs decisions about all aspects of life, and that   reflects existing social norms and processes.” (Adger et al. 2005, p78).   ADAPTATION IN CANADA   “Adaptation involves making adjustments in our decisions, activities and ways of   thinking in response to observed or expected changes in climate, with the goals of    (a) reducing harm and    (b) taking advantage of potential opportunities. Adaptation can include behavioural   changes, operational modifications, technological interventions, planning changes and   revised investment practices, regulations and legislation.    While adaptation in the natural environment occurs spontaneously, adaptation in   human systems often benefits from careful planning that is guided by both scientific   research and detailed understanding of the systems involved. “   (Warren and Lemmen 2014).     29 | P a g e    5.3.1 A UNIFIED APPROACH TO CHANGE   With the 2014/2015 assessments, the IPCC increased its focus to include adaptation to climate  change as an activity necessary to prepare the world for changes that are already upon us and  changes that are to come.  In much of the literature, mitigation has been discussed separate  from adaptation, as though the two are not intrinsically linked.  But mitigative efforts will have  effects on both short- and long-term initiatives in adaptation (e, g., proposed shifts to biofuels  could increase demands on land and water resources), and adaptation efforts will have  consequences for mitigation (e.g., using air conditioning to deal with higher temperatures  increases energy demands).  When communities and organizations develop climate change  action plans, it can be difficult to define policies and activities in the context of only one of  these two categories.  By example, enhancing the urban canopy is both mitigative (i.e., it will  increase carbon uptake) and adaptive (i.e., it will improve shading, reduce heat and provide  shelter from wind).     To be at their most effective, approaches to reducing the risks and managing responses to  climate change will require individuals, communities and organizations to embrace both  mitigative and adaptive actions to avoid or reduce anticipated impacts to environment and to  society (Locatelli et al. 2015; Watkiss et al. 2015).        In this text, adaptation is understood to include:   • mitigation efforts to reduce emissions, as well as    • adaptive efforts to increase capacity to cope with change.   Each climate change strategy will include mitigative and adaptive options,   but no single option will be sufficient by itself.  Effective   implementation will depend on policies and cooperation at all scales of   governance and industry and can be enhanced through integrated   responses that link mitigation and adaptation with other societal   objectives. (IPCC 2014c Climate Change Synthesis Report AR5 WGII, III).   “Because mitigation is intended to reduce the  harmful impacts of climate change, it is part of a   broader policy framework that also includes   adaptation to climate impacts”. (IPCC 2014b, p37)   We basically have three choices:   mitigation, adaptation and suffering.   We’re going to do some of each. The   question is what the mix is going to be.   The more mitigation we do, the less   adaptation will be required and the less   suffering there will be.  (Attributed to John P.  Holdren, Assistant to the President (Obama) for Science   and Technology and Director, Office of Science and   Technology Policy,     30 | P a g e    5.4 CURRENT APPROACHES TO ADAPTATION   For decades, throughout Canada many governments, organizations and communities have been addressing  existing and projected changes in the climate through the development of adaptation plans and guidelines.  A wide  range of approaches have been used, some more oriented to general policy and others focused on responses to  specific conditions such as sea-level rise.  Many of the provinces and territories have made significant gains in  assessing the potential risks and in devising overarching policy to guide adaptation and mitigation.     For a number of years, Natural Resources Canada’s Climate Change Directorate, the Adaptation Platform and other  government initiatives have been reporting on science-based assessments of climate change and climate change  adaptation Available at: https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/environment/impacts-adaptation/adaptation-platform/10027).   NRCan also supported and cost-shared the formation of Regional Adaptation Collaboratives in six regions across  the country, focused on helping communities prepare for and adapt to local impacts.  The federal government has  also used the application process for gas tax refunds to encourage Canadian municipalities to include adaptation  and mitigation in planning for local sustainability (In Nova Scotia, the provincial government went a step further,  requiring separate Municipal Climate Change Action Plans) (GOV/CAN/CAN-NS 2011; GOV/CAN/NS 2011).     Some of the earliest initiatives have been in communities faced with threats from water level changes.  A review  (2015-2016) of a selection of coastal (including the Great Lakes) Canadian community adaptation plans and  guidelines noted that they generally fell into one of the following four categories (Tables 5-2, 5-3):   • CATEGORY 1:  A broad assessment of the existing and potential threat posed by climate change.  Less  information on guidance for adaptation and development.    • CATEGORY 2:  A broad guideline on adaptation policy and principles, with little regional focus.    • CATEGORY 3:  A more targeted approach that focuses on local context for adaptation but without specific  details.   • CATEGORY 4:  A guideline that includes specific mitigation and adaptation options for use in a defined  location/region, offering local guidance for action.    These, and other, short- and long-term initiatives have contributed significantly to an improved understanding of  the effects of changing conditions at the local level, and bolstered community and organizational capacity by  providing access to scientists, technology and other resources not normally found within the capacity of  municipalities.  The projects advanced local knowledge on climate change and its impacts, furthered understanding  of exposure and vulnerability to hazards, and proposed early steps towards the development of risk management  processes to address anticipated issues.  Many approaches focused on single attributes of climate change (e.g.,  sea-level rise, severe weather) as opposed to taking a broader look at how a changing environment would affect  the well-being of the community.  Fewer studies proposed specific activities to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions.

| P a g e    Action to date on climate change in Canada could be separated into two categories:   • Early efforts (i.e., pre-2012) in which governments, communities, industries and  organizations attempted to understand the threats associated with a changing global  environment, and how that could affect them either locally, or in the national or  international contexts of their work and/or markets.    • More recent efforts (i.e., 2012 to date) during which time the public (and many  governments) have accepted scientific warnings about human induced global warming and  have realized that continued greenhouse gas emissions will launch society into a period of  unprecedented change and catastrophe experienced at a global and a local level.      Because much of the earlier work was often led through environmentally focussed agencies and  organizations, it often did not gain the widespread acceptance needed across industrial, economic  and planning sectors.  While gains were made in planning for climate change, most dealt with  traditional responses to the need to update protection from floodwaters, be they riverine or  marine.     The argument about tenuous connections between increasingly severe weather and a warming  global climate continued, often supported by the lack of statistically relevant data on the probability  for continued occurrence of intense storm events.  Less emphasis was placed on local efforts to  reduce GHG emissions, probably because there was little impetus by higher levels of government  to initiate the sort of societal change that would be needed to achieve significant reductions in the  harvest, transportation and use of fossil fuels.    As a result, most of the past decade of work on climate change has had as its focus the engagement  of the public in ‘bottom up’ goal setting and planning initiatives that may or may not have received  the attention needed by decision-makers responsible for initiating recommended changes to  current practice.            STRENGTHS OF EARLY APPROACHES   • Development of methodologies to proactively engage the public    • Shared perspectives on goals and public valuations of vulnerable   assets   • Early attention to the need to address overland flooding   • Constructive dialogues on the need to reduce vulnerabilities to   catastrophic losses   • Preliminary estimates of the economic value of affected assets and   the potential for damage and/or loss   • Assessment of capacity in emergency response resources   • Community- university alliances to build local capacity   • Increased emphasis on the need for good science   • Knowledge dissemination to the public   • Development of initial guidelines to assist in changes to   development planning and management   • Along marine coasts -  the focus has been on response to sea-  level rise   MISSED OPPORTUNITIES    • Limited engagement across sectors and levels of governments   • Limited national / regional policy or guidelines on mitigation and   adaptation efforts   • Lack of integration into existing policies, plans and practices   • Little updating of regulations and codes (e.g., environmental,   waste treatment, construction)   • ‘Business as usual’ in many development planning and permitting   activities   • Limited resources for new science and technology   • Continued separation of adaptation and sustainability policies   • Limited recognition of the roles played by natural features (e.g.,   beaches, dunes, wetlands, coastal and urban forests)   • Lack of understanding of the secondary impacts of climate change   on primary industry sectors and social well-being   • Failure to change current practices in waterfront development   • Along marine coasts-the focus was on response to sea-level rise.     34 | P a g e    REFERENCES   Adger, W.

While sea-level rise is increasingly becoming an issue  for some of Canada’s marine coasts, it is not the only  challenge facing our society.  Villages, towns and  cities across the nations share most of the same  threats associated with extreme weather, increasing  periods of heat and cold, destabilized soils, higher  concentrations of ground level ozone, damaged  structures, and pressures to maintain  environmentally sensitive economic sectors.   The policies and practices employed today must be  relevant across a range of altering spatial and  temporal conditions.  Planning now for current  resilience and future sustainability offers the widest  range of opportunities to best address the immediate  and coming challenges.  Decision-makers who avoid  timely planning and/or action may increasingly be  held liable for failure to notify the public of  anticipated changes in vulnerability and risk, and for  allowing development policy and permitting to  proceed without needed changes.

At the federal level, systems were created when the   distribution of Canadian population was 80% rural and only 20% urban.    Consequently, federal policies and programs have dealt primarily with the   management of resources and not with the management of communities.  In   today’s world, 80% of Canadians live in urban centres and only 20% remain   in rural areas, increasing demands on local levels of government.    Municipalities are challenged with the provision of services to growing   populations, relying on taxation as their primary mechanism to raise funds.    This situation can result in short-term management with limited   opportunities to plan for or to execute widespread change.  Policies that   direct the management of local assets may originate with federal or regional   levels of government, but action is best accomplished at the local level,   through careful education of the public, and the collaborative engagement   of local governments.   It is widely accepted that reduction of existing and anticipated risks can offer   the best path towards enhancing the capacity of local governments to   withstand, and/or to adapt to both the insidious (long-term) and catastrophic   (rapid onset) hazards now associated with a changing climate.  To be   successful, planning, design, construction, and management that addresses   anticipated changes in environmental conditions will be complex adventures,   undertaken by many actors, having wide-spread ramifications that affect all   levels of industry and society.  While significant strides have been made in   adaptation planning in some areas, many efforts still operate outside of core   planning and development activities, and/or have yet to affect operations,   making implementation difficult and reducing the potential for measurable   gains.  At the same time, it must be recognized that responses to this   complicated issue increase the demand on already constrained fiscal and   human resources, limiting local capacity to make effective changes until   threats become imminent.  In the face of economic uncertainties, many   players in the private sector wait for government to establish a direction for   change through policy or regulatory instruments, arguing fiscal limitations   and the need to align closely with anticipated government expectations as   the rationale to delay their own action.      Much good work has already been done, but some   situations may require a broader approach to reduce   contributions to global warming and to successfully   capture the potential benefits of the changing   climate, while avoiding the myriad impacts to human   society and to individual well-being.

Available at;   https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/environment/impacts-adaptation/adaptation-platform/10027 ).   https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/environment/impacts-adaptation/adaptation-platform/10027   45 | P a g e    6.2 FACING MOUNTING CHALLENGES   Climate change poses three immediate challenges to Canadian society.  First, we must  reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases from current numbers if we are to slow the  pace of the changing climate and avoid the anticipated and severe impacts to the  environment and to society.  Second, we need to prepare society and the economy  for the impacts that are occurring and will continue to occur.  And third, we need to  plan now for anticipated impacts that have yet to manifest.     In many planning, design, construction and management activities, it can be difficult  to distinguish between efforts that can be described as mitigation and efforts  described as adaptation.  In this document, effects to reduce emissions and to  improve carbon sequestering (mitigation) and efforts to change how society faces  ongoing and anticipated changes (adaptation) are both generally accepted as being  efforts towards adaptation.   In seeking opportunities to reduce emissions, the oil and gas sector is often targeted  because it is one of the largest contributors to greenhouse gases in Canada.  However,  responsibility for emission reductions should not be left with the resources extraction  sectors.  As a society, we demand energy to fuel our homes, to run our businesses,  and to transport ourselves and our goods.  The production of energy and its use in  transportation and in buildings accounts for a whopping 72% (520 of 725 Mt) of the  gases emitted annually (Figure 6-2).     This places the burden of reducing energy demands on the backs of every Canadian.   New development should address the requirements of a changing climate in siting,  design and construction.  Existing structures will need retrofit to reduce energy  consumption, improve resilience and ensure safety and well-being of users.  Public  infrastructure such as water, wastewater and transportation systems will need to be  re-assessed and adjusted to anticipated changing conditions.  And overall, if we are to  manage the future to our benefit, a significant change will be needed in individual,  corporate and government behaviour.  A new way of thinking.  A new way of being.                      THREE CATEGORIES OF RESPONSE TO A CHANGING CLIMATE   REDUCE EMISSIONS/SEQUESTER CARBON: Environmental changes are   already taking place.  The window is closing for opportunities to slow the pace   of change, and to moderate anticipated extremes.  Immediate efforts to reduce   emissions are needed across all sectors.  Enhancing our ability to sequester   carbon will help.   PREPARE FOR RAPID ONSET HAZARDS:  Changes associated with significant   weather events (e.g. storm surges, extreme wind and wave activity, erosion,   landslides) are already happening in some areas, and with little warning.    Hazards created by severe weather may intensify or become more frequent   because of the changes in climate.  Planning and design for changing   conditions can avoid impacts, reduce damage and improve human safety and   well-being.    PLAN NOW FOR SLOW ONSET HAZARDS:  Environmental changes, such as   increasingly extreme temperatures, drought, and sea-level rise, that impact   cumulatively or progressively over the long term are termed ‘slow onset’ or   ‘creeping’ hazards.  Planning for these changes should take place early to avoid   impacts, minimize damages, reduce costs and create new opportunities.   FIGURE 6-2:  Breakdown of greenhouse gas emissions in Canada in 2016 by   economic sector (GOV/CAN/ECCC 2018.  Available at:   https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/climate-  change/greenhouse-gas-emissions/sources-sinks-executive-summary-2018.html ).   https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/climate-change/greenhouse-gas-emissions/sources-sinks-executive-summary-2018.html https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/climate-change/greenhouse-gas-emissions/sources-sinks-executive-summary-2018.html   46 | P a g e    6.2.1 THE BENEFITS OF INTERDISCIPLINARY APPROACHES                                                 FIGURE 6-3:  Innovative planning and design requires the engagement of many specialist, and community   players into a collaborative team (adapted from Thompson and Sorvig 2008).   The complexity of the problems posed by climate change is reflected in the wide- ranging impacts to environment and to society, and in the multiple ramifications  of even the simplest actions taken in response.   For this reason, most challenges  will benefit from an interdisciplinary approach that engages an array of  appropriate disciplines and professions, that respects local knowledge and that  honours the benefits of community collaboration (Figure 6-3).  Teams must be  place-based, because conditions may vary geographically.     While traditional approaches to problem-solving often utilize a standard design  process (problem delineation, design, specification, construction, operation and    maintenance), climate change demands two additional steps implemented at the  beginning of the process – team building and goal setting.     Because creativity and innovation will drive many solutions to climate impacts, it  is important that all players are engaged and contributing early in the process.   Community knowledge, education and support will enhance knowledge, result in  shared goals and contribute to successful implementation.  Challenged by the  need to respect multiple perspectives, design professionals will have to reach  past established norms, and engage contractors early in the process, to expand  upon the opportunities available for workable alternatives to traditional practice.     47 | P a g e    6.2.2 BUILDING ON WHAT WE HAVE   Depending on location, ownership, scale and operational factors, there can  be a wide range of tools and instruments administered by municipal,  county/district, provincial/territorial and/or federal authorities to manage  land development, resource extraction, construction and maintenance of  structures, utilities, water, wastewater, solid waste and transportation  systems and other myriad components of society (Table 6-2).  Whether  applied in anticipation or in response to a climate related impact, these  existing regulatory instruments, tools and standards could be adapted to  reduce risk through avoidance of impact, to minimize the damages  anticipated and to advance proactive planning for change.     Careful examination of tools we already have in place could provide  significant opportunities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, reform  community development patterns, increase green infrastructure, and avoid  or reduce vulnerabilities to hazards created or exacerbated by a changing  environment. However, significant complexities are encountered when  attempting to work across the sectors and levels of government.   Development planning and management will benefit most when a multi- pronged process requires an array of government agencies to collaborate in  their efforts to protect people, property and the environment.     As our physical environment changes, there will be wide-spread and knock- on impacts across ecosystems and across society, requiring careful re- examination of current regulatory instruments and practice to ensure that:   • all instruments accurately reflect existing and anticipated changes  in the environment, including anticipated changes that could affect  the long-term life of the proposed development;    • alterations to regulatory instruments accept entrained uncertainty  in projections for future conditions (e.g., height of storm surge;  extreme precipitation events), but that such uncertainty does not  postpone making needed changes now;    • changes to regulatory instruments are co-ordinated across related  policy, programs, and enforcement practices to ensure a united  approach; and   • there are periodic reviews of the effectiveness of regulatory  instruments to ensure ongoing relevance to the issues at hand.

As  concerns rise over the need to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and to anticipate changes in local environmental  conditions, assessment processes will likely require more stringent examination of a range of factors with direct and  indirect ramifications to and from climate change.  Complications will arise over estimated life-cycle impacts given  continuing uncertainties on the timing and scope of future changes in the environment attributed to global warming.     With the exception of stormwater management guidelines, many of the environmental requirements applied to  industrial, commercial, institutional and residential development within Canada come under the jurisdiction of federal  and provincial/territorial governments.  Changes in the physical environment attributed to climate change and severe  weather events may alter local and regional conditions sufficiently to require governments to adjust regulations,  standards and codes of practice such as:   • requirements for mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions could spur changes to air quality regulations;   • higher water temperatures in fresh-water and nearshore coastal environments, and/or lower surface water flows  during drought, increases the potential for eutrophication, requiring additional levels of treatment for municipal  sewage and for industrial and commercial effluents;   • increased precipitation events above current design standards for significant storms (e.g., 1 in 10, 1 in 25 year),  exceed the capacity for municipal stormwater collection and disposal systems, resulting in damage to:    ▪ infrastructure and in erosion, sedimentation and (additional) contamination of waterways;    ▪ increased precipitation and associated overland flooding results in contamination of surface waters affecting   water quality in drinking water and limiting recreational use of waterways;    ▪ increased precipitation places higher demands on current practices in erosion and sedimentation control   during construction and operation;    ▪ extraction permits for surface water use (e.g., drinking water, irrigation) are constrained by drought   conditions and or contamination;   ▪ accepted practice for the removal, transportation and disposal of contaminated sediments and soils may no   longer be appropriate;   ▪ more intense storms with associated high intensity wave conditions re-suspend contaminants entrained in   bottom sediments, resulting in impacts to local fisheries, and potentially requiring the closure of some   fisheries as food sources; and    ▪ tailings / treatment ponds used in the mining sector and/or by other industrial activities may no longer   function adequately (e.g., residence time) requiring increased pond size, strengthening of containment   systems, and/or additional treatment.   Also, of concern are the effects of a changing environment on special places, such as parks, conservation areas and cultural   landscapes.  While there may be little that can be accomplished through human interventions, a reduction in the stresses   to these assets from existing and potential human activities can improve their capacity to withstand some of the   anticipated changes associated with changing climatic condition and severe weather events.      49 | P a g e    6.2.4 USING FISCAL INCENTIVES   As early as 2005, the National Roundtable on the Environment and the Economy (NRTEE) had  estimated that the average annual costs of climate change for Canada would be $5 Billion by  2020 rising to consume as much as $43 Billion by 2050 (GOV/CAN/NRTEE 2011).  It is becoming  widely accepted that efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and early attention to  avoidance of impact is more economically rational than the costs of recovery.  Costs associated  with damage to infrastructure, environments and human well-being have already placed  significant and unsustainable demands on the financial capacity of governments, industry,  communities, financial institutions and individuals.  Throughout the country, the prospect of  increasing hazards (e.g., overland flooding, landslides, wind and wave damage) is contributing  to a re-examination of insurance coverage, government subsidies for damage, and personal  and public risk.  Whether the objectives are to reduce emissions, to stave off the worst of  anticipated changes, to proactively adapt to avoid hazards and to reduce damages, or to  anticipate how change will provide economic and social opportunities, the money spent today  will reduce negative economic impacts and improve capacity to capture benefits.    When examining how economic leverage is used or can be used to affect decision-making,  there are three categories for how monetary incentives can work for or against proactive  planning for climate change: positive economic incentives; negative economic incentives (or  disincentives; and perverse incentives that arise when practice conflicts with new policy (AID  Environment 2004).     In some situations, decisions on whether to abide by the intent of positive incentives can be  significantly affected by factors that include:   • the financial consequences and the political and social acceptability of failing to  comply;   • the complexity, costs and effectiveness of alternative options;   • the degree of compatibility with other political, economic, environmental and social  goals; and   • overall compatibility with market interests.   While many incentives fall within the responsibility of governments, other institutional  strictures (e.g., insurance, mortgages) could be applied to alter both development practice and  industrial and commercial operations.                 INCENTIVES FOR CHANGE   POSITIVE INCENTIVES promote and encourage beneficial change   (e.g. rebates for energy conservation retrofit to buildings, lower taxes   on low-impact developments, reduced costs for public   transportation).  Positive incentives can also indirectly effect beneficial   change when measures such as wastewater reduction and treatment   have knock-on benefits to the health of ecosystems, to support for   natural assets (e.g. wetlands) that afford protection from storm   events, to quality of life, and to the profitability of sectors such as   tourism.   DISINCENTIVES generally encompass a range of financial penalties   for activities that can add to emissions or contribute negatively to   efforts to manage changing conditions (e.g. higher costs for parking   in downtown areas, fines for failures to disconnect roof drains, fines   for cutting mature trees);   PERVERSE INCENTIVES arise when existing practices reward   unsustainable behaviour.  Government subsidies and tax breaks to the   fossil fuel industry are perhaps some of the most egregious examples   of perverse incentives at a time when nations are attempting to   reduce GHG emissions.  However, other examples of perverse   incentives include areas where residents are still required to connect   roof drainage to stormwater collection systems, or where rebates are   offered to farmers to continue maintaining dyked land as farmland   rather than returning it to salt marsh.     50 | P a g e    6.2.5 OVERCOMING OBSTACLES   Many communities, organizations and individuals face considerable obstacles in  gaining the understanding, acceptance and willingness to change behavior and to  alter structures and systems, whether the focus is on mitigation of greenhouse  gas emissions or adaptation to a changing climate (Mukheibir et al. 2013).   Identifying obstacles is an important exercise, because failure to acknowledge the  issues complicates solving the problem and moving forward.  At the local level,  progress towards change can be obstructed by limitations in resources and  conflicting priorities for action.  Planning and management systems can be  resistant, especially in municipalities where town plans traditionally require  lengthy processes for public consultation before changes can be made.  Industrial  and commercial ventures can fear loss of competitive advantages if they are the  first of their sector to invest resources in mitigation and adaptation.   There is no single process, framework or pathway for mitigation and adaptation   that can solve all these issues or that can satisfy the myriad needs of local   planning and implementation.  It is accepted that leadership is critical, as is the   capacity to capture existing and potential synergies that ensure lowest costs and   highest benefits.  It is also clear (IPCC 2012) that to be successful, adaptation   processes must pay careful attention to acquiring the following attributes:                            OBSTACLES TO ADAPTATION   • Historic predictability in environmental conditions, leading to low importance given to natural   disasters and vulnerability to hazards.    • Tensions created between short political and budget cycles of municipal governments and the   need for city managers to have a long-term vision on climate change.   • Inadequate knowledge of anticipated changes in local environmental conditions.   • Championing adaptation to climate change has been led mainly by environmental vs   economic development departments.   • Local governments are relegated to observer status in national and international discussions   on climate change.   • Conflicts over data sharing across levels of government and disciplines of research.   • Concerns about protecting private property rights.   • Limited fiscal resources/human capacity to develop and apply data collected using   technologies such as LiDAR.   • Inadequate predictive modelling of impacts possible from a range of climate change scenarios    • Inadequate understanding of the linkages between environmental conditions and societal   well-being.   • Lack of relevant information developed at scales appropriate for local application.   • Delay in leadership from higher levels of government.   • Fragmented and ineffective institutional arrangements, with special reference to poor   coordination across the sectors and levels of government in Canada.   • Assertions that planning and design decision-making must wait for changes in codes and   regulations and/or precise information on needed changes to existing structures, new   investments, and/or zoning of land use.     • Continued reliance on existing standards for planning, design and operation of systems (e.g.,   water, wastewater, stormwater, and flood zoning).    • Reluctance to be the first community or industry to initiate action on mitigation and   adaptation.   • Often constrained financial and human resources assigned to immediate and traditional   priorities.   • Limitations to options for raising funds to support new initiatives in proactive planning for   climate change, or to respond to damages being incurred from extreme weather.    • Inability for many communities to address the residual damages of climate change (i.e., the   things that cannot be avoided), because they have no economic or feasible options.   • Lack of political support for action.

While it is possible for individuals, organizations, communities and sectors to develop and to  implement their own plans for adaptation to change, working in isolation from international, national, regional  and provincial/territorial policies and practices can be difficult, and may result in failures to capture the widest  possible range of benefits from risk reduction measures.  Where possible and pragmatic, it may be best to become  fully informed and participatory in top-down policy and practise development.  It will also be important to ensure  that planning for a changing climate is not relegated to one aspect of a business or community, but fully integrated  across all systems and sectors, or mainstreamed.     Mainstreaming climate change in governance and/or private sector management could include a range of  approaches and activities including (Wamsler 2015):   • Strategic collaboration among relevant internal as well as external players;    • Revision or creation of policies, regulations and instruments that improve harmonization and encourage  action;    • Modification of existing institutional structures and working arrangements to enhance resources, action  responsibility, and improve visibility for action on climate change;   • Re-alignment of on-the-ground activities to reflect policy changes and to implement action;   • Development and communication of new instructions for operations and development decision-making;  and    • Resources to support new initiatives in mitigation and adaptation.   To make this happen across our complex society, there is a growing need for strong, practical and insightful  leadership to coordinate requirements for new development and to inform decision-making on mitigation and  adaptation.  Leadership can facilitate the development of a shared understanding of the challenges and a common  vision of the future.  Good leadership can bring together the multiple components of an organization that will be  affected by either the impacts of climate change, or by the adaptation responses to those changes.     ⁰                      MAINSTREAMING:  The incorporation of climate   change considerations into established or   ongoing development programs, policies, or   management strategies rather than developing   adaptation and mitigation initiatives separately.    (Burkett and Davidson 2012)   “Integrating climate change and   sea-level rise into infrastructure   planning improves risk and life-  cycle cost management and will   reduce the vulnerability of B.C.’s   critical infrastructure.”   (Lemmen et al. 2008.

Eisenhower     52 | P a g e    6.3.1 USING PRINCIPLES TO GUIDE POLICY DEVELOPMENT   Guiding principles can outline a clear vision for managing  human use of the landscape that is based on respect for the  past, responsiveness to the needs of today, and advance  proactive planning measures that anticipate future  conditions and hazards and provide timely responses to  complicated situations.   Guiding principles provide a foundation for policy and  decision-making that can be relevant at all levels of  government and to any or all parties involved in community  development and management, including the private sector,  conservation organizations, and individual property owners.   Adoption of guiding principles provides a context and focus  for identifying issues, offers support for priority setting, and  provides focus for action.     Once a suite of guiding principles has been adopted, goals  and measurable objectives can be developed to act on those  principles, tailored to specific local conditions and needs  (Kanuri et.al. 2016).  Well-stated goals and objectives  provide a framework for what needs to be done, how it  should be done, and how it can be determined if it was done  well.                            15 PRINCIPLES TO GUIDE POLICY DEVELOPMENT IN A CHANGING WORLD   This list is a sample of principles for guiding policy development that was gleaned from efforts to promote   sustainability and resilience, and from the principles and goals of a range of initiatives in development   planning in Canada and throughout the world (Ballinger et al. 2000; Field et al. 2001; GOV/AUSTRAL/NSW   2009; GOV/AUSTRAL/WA 2012; GOV/UK 2010; GOV/UK/DEFRA 2006a, 2006b; Hamin and Gurran 2009;   IOC 2009; Simpson et al. 2012; Tomlinson and Helman 2006; UN 2012; UNEP/GPA 2005, 2009).     GAIN support from all levels and sectors of government, and from affected decision-makers.    EMPLOY risk assessment tools focussed on creating resilient and sustainable communities and systems.   ADOPT ecosystem-based approaches to management that protect ecosystems and ecosystem services.    REDUCE demands for energy and support renewable energy initiatives.   IMPROVE opportunities for carbon sequestering.   ADDRESS proactively the threats and options for protection of cultural assets.   ENHANCE the capacity of natural features to protect people and their livelihoods.   ENTRENCH planning and design principles that reduce energy consumption and improve sustainability.    REDUCE risk and improve resilience through retrofitting existing structures and systems.   BUILD with insight and innovation.   ADVOCATE for the benefits of early migration away from increasingly hazardous areas.   ENSURE social justice and seek opportunities to continue public access to assets.   ENGAGE the public through communication of opportunities, constraints, and shared risk.     CONTINUE risk assessment that include indicators of socioeconomic change and ecosystem health.     SHARE good practices and lessons learned.          53 | P a g e    6.4 GUIDING PRINCIPLES FOR CHANGE   One of the challenges being experienced in planning for adaptation to  climate change is the lack of a framework for what needs to be done, who  needs to do it and how they should be guided in their actions.  Perhaps, as a  society, and as professionals, we need to restate basic principles that should  be understood, but somehow, are not often enough heard in discussions on  policy, planning and design.    Within landscape architecture in Canada, there was a need to articulate a  framework to guide thinking, and eventually, decision-making.  Colleagues  told us that, increasingly, clients sought to be informed on changes in  weather and climate and the import of those changes on their decisions.   Responding to need for planning and design professional to re-engage as  leaders on a broad array of public policy, the Canadian Society of Landscape  Architects, through its Committee on Climate Adaptation, has been working  to confirm principles at the core of the profession; to reaffirm commitments  to principles that advance human well-being, argue for social justice, and  promote effective stewardship of the environment.     Throughout the world, in the 21st century there has been a restatement of  basic principles, an expectation for how humans will interact with each other,  and a resurgence of the need to share responsibility for how actions at home  affect worldwide economics, environments and the safety and well-being of  distant communities.    The discussion on what to do about climate change has become part of the  dialogue on fundamental values so aptly reflected in The Millennium  Declaration.                            THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION   The 2000 Millennium Declaration of the United Nations declares the following six values   to be fundamental to individual societies and to international relations in the twenty-first   century:     “FREEDOM. Men and women have the right to live their lives and raise their children   in dignity, free from hunger and from the fear of violence, oppression or injustice.   Democratic and participatory governance based on the will of the people best   assures these rights.     EQUALITY. No individual and no nation must be denied the opportunity to benefit   from development. The equal rights and opportunities of women and men must be   assured.     SOLIDARITY. Global challenges must be managed in a way that distributes the costs   and burdens fairly in accordance with basic principles of equity and social justice.   Those who suffer or who benefit least deserve help from those who benefit most.     TOLERANCE. Human beings must respect one other, in all their diversity of belief,   culture and language. Differences within and between societies should be neither   feared nor repressed but cherished as a precious asset of humanity. A culture of   peace and dialogue among all civilizations should be actively promoted.    RESPECT FOR NATURE. Prudence must be shown in the management of all living   species and natural resources, in accordance with the precepts of sustainable   development. Only in this way can the immeasurable riches provided to us by nature   be preserved and passed on to our descendants. The current unsustainable patterns   of production and consumption must be changed in the interest of our future welfare   and that of our descendants.     SHARED RESPONSIBILITY. Responsibility for managing worldwide economic and   social development, as well as threats to international peace and security, must be   shared among the nations of the world and should be exercised multi-laterally. As   the most universal and most representative organization in the world, the United   Nations must play the central role.”   United Nations General Assembly. 2000, United Nations Millennium Declaration, Resolution 55/2,   United Nations A/RES/55/2, 18 September 2000, page 2                       54 | P a g e    THE IFLA GLOBAL ACCORD   In searching for ways global principles could be brought to bear  on local decision-making, Canadians – working with the  International Federation of Landscape Architects – articulated  a framework for practice, based on three guiding principles for  planning and design outlined in the IFLA Global Accord –  planning for a changing future    (Available at:  http://iflaonline.org/professional-practice-and- policy/working-groups-and-task-forces/climate-change/ ).   The Accord’s three linked principles: resilience, transformation  and sustainability, provide decision-makers with a foundation  for their work to reduce emissions and to adapt to existing and  anticipated changes in their environment.  The Accord draws on  individual and collaborative ingenuity to promote the  innovative new perspectives and technologies necessary to  create the prosperous future we have as yet only dreamed  about.    In 2017, the IFLA Global Accord was ratified by the five world  regions (IFLA Europe, IFLA Middle East, IFLA Africa, IFLA  Americas, and IFLA Asia-Pacific) and the IFLA World Council (76  national associations).  The Canadian Society of Landscape  Architects was the first national association to ratify the Accord,  and work is apace to promote the Accord’s principles  throughout the profession, across allied professions and  economic sectors and throughout the myriad levels of  government.                       http://iflaonline.org/professional-practice-and-policy/working-groups-and-task-forces/climate-change/ http://iflaonline.org/professional-practice-and-policy/working-groups-and-task-forces/climate-change/   55 | P a g e    6.4.1 ENHANCING RESILIENCE   Resilience at its heart is a concept we use to improve our understanding of how persistence and  transformation co-exist within and transform living systems, including humans and human society  (Adger et al. 2011; Folke et al. 2011).  Resilience describes the capacity to absorb change without being  changed.  When thresholds are exceeded, and tipping points are reached, species, ecosystems,  individuals and society may transform into altered states, sometimes altering to a positive reality,  sometimes to a negative one.  The same is true for buildings, utilities, municipal systems, transportation  networks.  Fostering resilience supports the well-being of existing systems, and in the case of human  society, encourages individual creativity, innovation, and enterprise.  Building resilience into  infrastructure is not without cost.  However, the costs associated with full replacement of damaged  systems may outweigh the costs of strengthening or duplicating existing systems so that they can still  perform to an acceptable standard after disaster events.    Within human society, resilient organizations demonstrate that they have the capacity to absorb  impacts and stresses (within limits), and/or to renew components or processes that were damaged by  change.  Resilient organizations are also more likely to be able to seize upon emerging opportunities to  reorganize their elements and processes in new and innovative ways (GRCI 2012).     Resilience is also a characteristic of individual human well-  being.  Strong individuals are better able to withstand, or to   recover from disease, damage and/or stresses. The   psychological resilience of an individual reflects their capacity   to adapt well to adversity, trauma, tragedy, threats or other   sources of stress such as family or relationship issues,   challenges to health and well-being, and/or concerns about   financial viability or conflicts in the workplace.  Resilient   people may be knocked down by life but will come back   stronger from difficult experiences.   Becoming resilient is not a passive activity.  Resilient people   and systems do not simply cope with events as they occur, they   survive and adapt, becoming better able to respond to the next   circumstance.  Communities in Canada exemplify what it is for   a society to be resilience: to not only absorb challenges and to   survive, but to adapt, and to transform so as to embrace all   opportunities for a better future (Figure 6-3).               RESILIENCE: “The capacity of social, economic, and   environmental systems to cope with a hazardous event or trend   or disturbance, responding or reorganizing in ways that   maintain their essential function, identity, and structure, while   also maintaining the capacity for adaptation, learning, and   transformation. “(IPCC 2014, p5)   re•sil•ient [ri-zil-yuhnt] adj.   1.  Able to bounce back after change or adversity.   2.  Capable of preparing for, responding to, and recovering   from difficult conditions.   Syn.: TOUGH     (City of New York 2013)   FIGURE 6-3:  Surviving, adapting and transforming as components of resilient living (Adapted from The Royal Society 2014).     56 | P a g e    If collaboration is the core of resilience, self-reliance is the driving force.  Self-reliance by  individuals, by organizations and by communities has historically been the cornerstone for  human society in Canada.  However, in the past century, as our society and communities have  advanced, we have become more expectant that technology and institutions will ensure our  well-being, and less engaged in engineering our own path towards a prosperous future.     Climate change will result in major anticipated changes to our environment, as well as myriad  other direct and indirect impacts that may be unforeseen.  This is the period in our history  when reliance on experience must run in tandem with personal and institutional ingenuity.  We  must rely on individual creativity and work collaboratively to ensure a resilient present and a  sustainable future.                                        The Killick – Canadian ingenuity at work   A killick is “an anchor made of an elongated stone encased in pliable   sticks, bound at the top and fixed in two curved cross-pieces, used in   mooring nets and small boats”.  (Source: Dictionary of Newfoundland   English, Online).  The term is believed to have originated either from   the Irish or Scots Gaelic to describe an ingenious method for creating   an anchor from readily found materials.  In Canada, Newfoundland   fishermen have for generations used killicks of all sizes and shapes as   temporary (or permanent) replacements for lost anchors.  Killicks are   the perfect example of the application of heritage and ingenuity in   promoting self-reliance.     “The capacity of individuals,   communities and systems to survive,   adapt, and grow in the face of stress   and shocks and even transform when   conditions require it.”   (Rockefeller Foundation)   IMAGE CREDIT: C. Mercer Clarke     57 | P a g e    LOW CARBON RESILIENCE: A BETTER PATH FORWARD   Throughout Canada, communities facing the complex and often costly challenges of the  changing climate may also be constrained by limited financial and human resources.  However,  with proactive and insightful planning and design, existing or restored natural systems can be  used to supplement existing structures and/or to deliver ecosystem services (e.g. sheltering,  stormwater management, flood protection) that may reduce costs while improving quality of  life in urban areas (SFU ACT 2016).                                                LOW CARBON RESILIENCE   Historically, greenhouse gas reduction (climate change mitigation)   and building resilience to climate change impacts (adaptation) have   been approached as separate processes. Combining these strategies   can achieve co-benefits and save time and money. Municipalities are   moving forward on both adaptation and mitigation planning, and   we have a limited window of opportunity in which to implement low   carbon resilience to avoid the risk of both building in vulnerability   to climate change impacts and inadvertently increasing emissions.     SFU/ACT 2017, p10   “Ecosystem-based “green infrastructure” projects   can help municipalities adapt to climate change   impacts such as flooding and extreme heat, and   offer multiple co-benefits.     However, cities are not necessarily valuing   ecosystem contributions to benefits such as   improved property safety and prices; the cultural,   spiritual, physical and mental health of residents;   water, food and energy security; carbon emissions   reductions; water and air pollution reductions, and   recreational values.    Furthermore, lack of capacity can make it difficult   for neighbouring municipalities to collaborate on   managing for ecosystem health across   jurisdictional boundaries.”  SFU/ACT. 2017, p5.   IMAGE CREDITS C. Mercer Clarke     58 | P a g e    6.4.2 ADVANCING POSITIVE TRANSFORMATIONS   In many cases, pursuing resilience in a settlement or society involves a pursuit of stability, an attempt to fortify  against changes in the hope that their negative impacts may be prevented.  In doing so, however, the society or  settlement becomes hardened, and brittle, in a state where it may be capable of resisting a normal suite of changes  that it is built to tolerate, but which risks a serious collapse when those capacities are surmounted, particularly  with long-term gradual shifts in conditions which that society does not adjust for.     This is why efforts to achieve positive transformative for societies must become a fundamental principle of policy  and planning.  Stability must be redefined to represent not just a physical stability, but a broader and proactive  resilience that requires active pursuit of positive transformation, to proactively adjust to conditions before their  negative impacts can be deeply felt.  Transformative societies do more than react to change, they embrace the  potential that change brings.  By abandoning brittle resistance to change, and adopting this fluidly strong sense of  transformative development, a better and truer form of social stability can emerge, one which looks forward to  the future self it must become, rather than backward to maintain the past self it once was.   In terms of climate change, positive transformation involves measures such as proactive reductions of GHG  emissions, to keep planetary warming within manageable rates.  It involves proactively adjusting development  patterns in advance of changing flood dynamics, to mitigate the immediate and long-term impacts upon residents.   It involves adjusting societal outlooks to reinforce a custodial perspective and an active involvement on the part  of most, if not all, of those resident in the region.  By accepting that change is inevitable and imminent, we can  discard the idea of retaining the dysfunctional past that puts us at risk, to embrace positive transformation towards  a better future.   At a time when much of Canada’s infrastructure requires repair and/or upgrading, when there is real social and  economic benefit to inner city renewal, and when we have finally come to realize the benefits of operating more  sustainably with nature than against it, the opportunities to rethink the structures and patterns of human society  have seldom been greater.  Since we must spend significant resources on our communities and our infrastructure,  why not create a vision better suited to provide for the well-being of all?                The 2014 IPCC report highlights:   “that we have the means to limit   climate change and its risks, with   many solutions that allow for   continued economic and human   development.    However, stabilizing temperature   increase to below 2°C relative to   pre-industrial levels will require an   urgent and fundamental departure   from business as usual.    Moreover, the longer we wait to   act, the more it will cost and the   greater the technological,   economic, social and institutional   challenges we will face.”    (IPCC 2014 Synthesis Report, p v).   We will build more infrastructure   in the next 40 years than (in the)   past 4000 years.  Parag Khanna, Author. 2018     59 | P a g e    6.4.3 ENSURING SUSTAINABILITY   Throughout the world, there has been a growing acceptance of the need to identify and to integrate within  planning and design practice the guiding principles, goals and objectives that promote sustainability (UN 2015).   Sustainability is an overarching goal for a future in which environmental, social and economic considerations are  balanced in the pursuit of an improved quality of life.  In a prosperous society, humans rely on a healthy  environment to provide food and resources, safe drinking water and clean air for all its citizens.     The concept of sustainable development first emerged in the late eighties as documented in a report of the World  Commission on Environment and Development (Brundtland 1987).  In Canada, environmentally sustainable  economic development was defined as development that meets the needs of the present without compromising  the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.  The concept seeks to irrevocably link the continuing  viability of natural systems with the cultural, political, and economic demands of a developing human society.     Sustainability is at last a practical goal.  As weather systems intensify, and climate changes place increasing  demands on infrastructure, environments and society, the cost of replacing damaged structures, protecting  threatened landscapes and rescuing people at risk will rapidly become unsupportable demands on human and  fiscal resources.  It is now no longer merely nice to consider the effects of decisions made today on future society,  it is prudent and insightful.     In recent years, the United Nations had renewed its convictions that sustainability is the pathway not only to  prosperity for all nations, but to a secured global peace (UN Millennium Declaration 2000).  Sustainability of  ecosystems and communities has become an increasingly important goal for short term as well as long term  planning.  As climate change disrupts ecosystems and communities, increasing demands on resources such as  water and food can result in the migration of populations away from areas of strife, towards areas that promise  safety and security.  Nations such as Canada, which are relatively well-equipped to plan for and to adapt to local  effects of climate change, will need to address these impacts of more severe effects of climate change on relatively  far-flung areas of the world, as they strive to successfully and sustainably incorporate large numbers of climate  refugees into their societies.     Considerable guidance on the meaning of sustainability in the modern world, and how organizations and  individuals can contribute can be found at the United Nations, from documents such as the Federal Sustainability  Strategy for Canada (2016-2019), or from community sustainability plans, which in some communities in Canada  have been related to impending changes due to shifts in climate and weather.                       SUSTAINABILITY calls for a decent standard of  living for everyone today without compromising  the needs of future generations.   “It lies in your power, and   therefore is your responsibility, to   reach the goals that you have defined”     (Kofi Annan, Secretary General, The United Nations   2000)   SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT is “development   that meets the needs of the present without   compromising the ability of future generations to   meet their own needs”   Government of Canada:  Federal Sustainable   Development Act   GOVERNMENT OF CANADA    FEDERAL SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY   (2016-2019).

To better understand and to manage the critical  intersection between human society and the  environment, James (2015) (Figure 6-4) uses four  dimensions for sustainability: ecology, economics,  politics and culture, and portrays the performance  towards sustainability.     The dimensions are comprised of a myriad of inter- linked processes and pathways that interact with  each other and affect the health and sustainability of  both the local and the global environment.  These  views of our future anticipate that well-being in  human communities will depend as much on our  ability to promote sustainable practices in sectors  such as agriculture, fisheries, and forestry, as it will on  changes to our expectations for the production and  consumption of goods and services.                 FIGURE 6-4:  Graphic depiction of the interlocking Circles of Sustainability as   described for Melbourne, Australia in 2011 (James 2015, used with permission).   CORE PRINCIPLES FOR ACTION:     “ECOLOGY:   Beyond choosing technical responses that enhance climate change adaptation, cities should seek to generate deeper and more integrated relationships with   nature both inside the city and beyond the urban boundary.   ECONOMICS:  In adopting a ‘no regrets’ precautionary approach, urban development should be based on an economy organized around negotiated social needs rather than   the conventional drive to economic growth.   POLITICS:   In adapting to climate change, cities should begin now to develop a clear vision and detailed adaptation plans through both expert deliberation and engaged   civic involvement.  These plans should be embedded across the board in all policymaking.     CULTURE:   In developing climate adaptation responses, cities should treat the process as one of deep cultural engagement involving broad cultural issues of social learning,   symbolism, visualization, aesthetics and well-being.“ (James 2015, p196)     62 | P a g e    6.5 FRAMING THE DISCUSSION   When responding either to a single and imminent threat, or a longer process to plan for a changing environment,   it is critical that discussion is framed to ensure that the benefits and costs of all options, shorter or longer term,   are adequately assessed. Originating with early UNESCO and IPCC reports, organizations and individuals in Canada   have for some time categorized efforts towards adaptation to a changing climate under three headings:    Accommodate, Protect, Retreat.  In much of the current literature, these have been appropriate categories, as the   focus was on responding to the effects of sea-level rise and severe weather along the coast.  However even in   coastal areas climate-related impacts will affect more than the immediate nearshore, and while rising seas and   flood waters may be the predominant issue facing many communities and ecosystems today, climate change will   result in a broader array of impacts, affecting environments and society throughout the country (Glavovic et al.   2008).     While they have come into more common use in Canada in climate planning dialogues, terms such as   accommodate, protect and retreat use a combative language supportive of views that see climate related impacts   as something to be conquered and overcome, rather than as inevitable change that will require societal   adjustments.  Protect can be the basis for inopportune and costly decisions for increasingly expensive   infrastructure.  Retreat conjures up a sense of failure, of being beaten in the fight against the changing elements.     Realistically, decision-makers will have few pathways for response.  They can determine that action on potential   threats should be deferred to a more appropriate time.  They can implement changes in practice and in structures   that allow builders and users to persist with their operations in their current location for a period.  Or it can be   determined that now, or in the future, there will be a need to remove structures and relocate activities away from   areas deemed hazardous- to migrate to better conditions (Figure 6-5).  No one approach for adjusting to climate   change will meet all anticipated challenges.  Most planning, design and operational efforts in mitigation and   adaptation will include one or more actions from all three approaches, anticipated to change over time as   conditions continue to change.     Throughout all efforts to anticipate and to plan for changes in the environment, it is essential that there is an   ongoing and continuous process of stakeholder-scientist interactions, that walks across disciplinary barriers, and   engages expert professionals, municipal staff and elected officials, provincial and territorial governments and   national climate adaptation agencies and resources.  Welcoming new ideas and innovative approaches must be a   core component of actions that not only allow society to continue, but to prosper.           63 | P a g e                                MIGRATE  DEFER PERSIST    • asset has minimal value /easily replaced   • retrofit is practical and achievable    • activities can be relocated   • risk levels are acceptable   • impacts can be managed through   accommodation   • impacts can be managed through   protection   • asset is highly valued and immoveable    • retrofit is implausible or cost prohibitive   • activities can not be relocated   • risk levels are acceptable   • hazard presents in the short and long term   • resources must be acquired   • asset is highly valued and movable   • activities can be relocated   • risk levels are unacceptable   • no feasible option for   accommodation/protection   • hazard presents in the short and long term   • alternative locations are available   • continue use as appropriate to risk   • apply accommodation measures (e.g., flood   proofing, energy retrofit)    • apply protection measures (e.g., seawalls,   trees)   • retrofit existing structures   • apply new standards for resilient structures   • no action in short term   • defer action on long term risks to future   • monitor and report on changes in risk    • institute restrictions on new development   • resource acquisition for future action   • relocate activities   • relocate structures   • restrict occupancy/use in at risk areas    • do not allow new development in at risk   areas   • build new structures in non-hazardous   areas   FIGURE 6-5:  An alternative approach to framing the discussion on adaptation/mitigation.   ADAPTATION PATHWAYS  FOR DECIS ION -MAKERS      64 | P a g e    6.5.1 DEFERRING THE RESPONSE   DEFER does not mean ‘do nothing’ or ‘’business as usual’.  As is the case in much planning and  management decision-making, decisions on an issue may be deferred due to factors such as:    • the responsibility for action falls to a different department, agency or level of  governance;   • it is inappropriate to act now on an issue that will occur at some point in the future;   • there are insurmountable limitations in current fiscal or human resources; and/or   • additional information is needed to inform decision-making.     • In the context of planning for a changing climate, DEFERRING decision-making is an  appropriate approach when:   • there is a partner willing to accept responsibility and act on needed changes;   • the anticipated hazards are not projected to materialize for some time;   • necessary resources must be found before action can be taken; and/or decisions  should wait on the provision of needed data on the issue and/or the conclusions of  risk management processes.   In all situations, choosing to DEFER decision-making on adaptation to climate change should  only proceed where provisions are made to gather needed information and resources or where  timely reassessment of the decision is entrenched within management processes.                             SAMPLE INITIATIVES INCLUDED IN A DEFER APPROACH   • Establishment of a reporting structure responsible for managing   data on changing conditions and/or regular updates to senior   management.    • Identification and documentation of offices and individuals   responsible for specific roles in adaptation planning and for   implementation.   • Establishment of collaborative relationships amongst appropriate   levels of government (e.g., agencies responsible for potable water   quality management and regulation).   • Periodic review of hazards and adaptation options to ensure that   anticipated timing and actions for hazard avoidance or hazard   adaptation remain viable.   • Calculation of anticipated future costs for adaptation, and   development of financing options to ensure sufficient resources   will be available when needed.   • Re-assessment of readiness and response measures to anticipated   disaster scenarios.     65 | P a g e    6.5.2 PERSISTING IN PLACE OR ACTIVITY   In much of the literature on adaptation to climate change in coastal areas, the focus has been  on impacts associated with sea-level rise, storm surge, and severe weather.  Consequently,  approaches have relied on mechanisms to accommodate rising water, or infrastructure to  protect against the threat of flooding.  The broader interpretation of anticipated impacts from  climate change on a broader class of landscapes and communities requires a more inclusive  approach to mechanisms to avoid, reduce or respond to anticipated risks associated not only  with damage from flooding, but also to address a range of complicated factors such as  extremes of heat and cold, changing seasonality, altered precipitation patterns, and increased  threats of physical disturbance such as landslides, erosion, and subsidence.    To PERSIST means that structures remain largely in place, while actions are taken to protect  them from anticipated risks (e.g., seawalls, flood-proofing, stabilization of shorelines,  retrofitted buildings) or that adjustments are made to human use so as to accommodate to  changing circumstances (e.g., suspension of activity during periods of increased threat,  seasonal vs year-round use of sites).  PERSISTING in place can be associated with high costs and  requirements for expert planning, design and maintenance.  Where retrofitting of existing  structures and infrastructure can be accomplished, actions taken now will be much more cost  effective than reactive measures to repair damage from changing conditions, or efforts to  resolve the anticipated impacts to human health and well-being.     In some circumstances, persisting PERSISTING may be a time dependent approach that requires  continued monitoring of changing circumstances, with provisions to abandon locations and  activities should threat levels increase.  In these situations, persisting PERSISTING in place will  become a somewhat temporary measure as efforts towards minimizing the risks associated  with climate change become cost prohibitive or impractical.  The practicality and associated  costs of choosing to PERSIST in place become more important when applied to the  sustainability of cultural and ecological assets important to local populations and to Canadian  (or indeed international) human society.  With time, and especially as the result of threats such  as rising seas, the opportunity to protect historic sites, natural parks, and areas of cultural  importance will diminish.  Where PERSIST has been chosen as the preferred approach to  adaptation, it is especially important that planning activities engage a number of professional  disciplines in efforts to prioritize risks, to identify options and to ensure that whatever actions  are decided upon, care is taken to ensure that the results are respectful of local environmental,  societal, cultural, and economic conditions.     Choosing to PERSIST as you are should only be used when it does not increase the risk to human  safety or health, with special care taken to ensure that the burden of risk is not assumed by  those who are more socially vulnerable (e.g., old or young, disabled, economically or socially  disadvantaged).        SAMPLE INITIATIVES INCLUDED IN A PERSIST APPROACH   INITIATIVES THAT ADVANCE ACCOMODATION OF ANTICIPATED CHANGES   • Advanced planning to reduce GHG contributions and avoid impacts.   • Adjustments to human use of areas designated as temporarily   hazardous.   • Flood-proofing buildings to reduce damage from overland   inundation.   • Retro-fitting structures to improve resilience to changing conditions   (e.g., roof-strengthening, upgraded insulation, secondary energy   sources).   • Budgeting for damages from periodic flooding of places and   buildings.   • Periodic re-evaluation of changing conditions to ensure that   expectations for safety and well-being remain unchanged.   • Augmented resources and training for disaster response.     • Insurance against anticipated damages.    INITIATIVES THAT PROVIDE PROTECTION FROM ANTICIPATED CHANGES   • Assessment of anticipated changes in flood levels, periodicity and   areas under threat.   • Protection for existing natural habitats (e.g., dune complexes, salt   marshes) in recognition of their contributions to reduction of wave   energy and reduction in flood potential.    • Augmentation of existing hard protection measures (e.g., seawalls,   dykes) to meet changing circumstances.   • Review of stormwater management policies and infrastructure to   reduce up-stream loading and to ensure down-stream capacity to   meet changing flows due to high precipitation events.    • Consideration of multiple approaches to prevent flooding from   stormwater and/or sea-level rise and storm surges, to include the   development of ‘soft’ armouring alternatives (e.g., afforestation of   shore vegetation, beach and littoral drift replenishment, dune and   wetland restoration).    • Maintenance of urban tree canopies to provide shelter from wind  and to reduce urban heat islands.      66 | P a g e    6.5.3 MIGRATING TO A BETTER FUTURE   When the option to retreat from a risk has been presented, decision-makers and the public  they serve can see choosing such an approach as a failure to deal with an encroaching threat -  essentially giving up.  But people, structures and ecosystems have been both migrating away  from impending threats, and towards more convivial circumstances throughout the history of  the planet.  Ecosystems and species will adapt and evolve as they have always done, and if they  have the capacity, migrate towards better conditions and away from increased competition for  resources and space.  It is human society that sees the threats posed by the changing  environment as challenges to be overcome.    Even with world-wide efforts to reduce greenhouse gases, science has concluded that the  process of planetary climate change that has been initiated will continue.  In some situations,  coastal areas in Canada will be faced with insurmountable risks as the climate changes.  Some  will present catastrophically in the short-term, others will arrive incrementally over longer time  frames.  It will become impractical, cost-prohibitive and/or dangerous to human populations  to remain in areas experiencing such threats.    MIGRATING over time from unsafe or less supportive conditions created by a changing climate  should be a prudent, proactive response intended to seize new opportunities for human health  and welfare.  With planned migration, changes to human communities can be made over  appropriate periods of time, ensuring that new areas for habitation are created with insight  and ingenuity, relying on principles that ensure sustainability and promote aesthetics.     Canada will increasingly need to address the issues associated with needed migration of people  of other nations that are disappearing beneath rising sees, that are experiencing war and other  forms of conflict, and from environments that are no longer hospitable for human populations.   Migration will place some pressures on existing communities and infrastructure that insightful  planning will help to reduce.                                 SAMPLE INITIATIVES INCLUDED IN A MIGRATE APPROACH   INITIATIVES THAT REDUCE RISK THROUGH AVOIDANCE OF HAZARDS   • Documentation of the timing, scale and spatial scope of unavoidable   hazards.    • Designation of areas unsafe for human use or occupation.   • Designation of areas where reconstruction or major repairs would   not be permitted.    • Designation of no-build areas (e.g., setbacks, flood plains).   INITIATIVES THAT REDUCE RISK BY RELOCATION TO SAFER AREAS   • Designation of non-hazardous areas for new development.   • Long term planning to relocate public infrastructure at safer sites.   • Withdrawal of government subsidies such as flood damage   reimbursement.   • Provision of financial support for removal to safer areas.
