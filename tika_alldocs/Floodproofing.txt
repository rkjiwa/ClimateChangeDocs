It is therefore  important to consider how a flood will affect  movement by people and vehicles (e.g. for  evacuation, or access by police, fire and  ambulance services). This requires consideration of  the anticipated flood depth, the speed that the  water will be moving and the distance to the  nearest “dry land”. A good rule of thumb is to  assume that for ponded (non-flowing) water, the  maximum depth of flooding for safe access by most  cars is about 0.3 metres (1 foot); the maximum  depth for pedestrian access is about 1.4 metres (5  feet) for adults and 1 metre (3 feet) for children)a .  These safe depths decrease as water velocity  increases. Even shallow water can sweep a  pedestrian or a vehicle away when flowing at  high velocity. Also remember that it may be  difficult to judge the depth and speed of flood  waters. Water may appear to be relatively calm even when moving at a high velocity and it may be  impossible to see the bottom to determine flood depth. Prolonged exposure to cold water could  lead to hypothermia.      In addition to property access, building accessibility is also an important consideration. Some of the  floodproofing measures described in this booklet restrict the use of doors and windows and may require  the use of alternate entrances and exits.    Municipal by-laws and permits - As is the case with any construction including modifications to existing  buildings, floodproofing must be carried out in accordance with all applicable building code, fire code,  local by-law and building permit requirements. For example, the local planning authority (i.e., municipality,  regional municipality, rural community, Regional Service Commission or the province as the case may be)  may prohibit construction within a flood hazard area or impose specific conditions. For more information  contact your local planning authority.      Provincial policies and permits - A Watercourse and Wetland Alteration Permit  is required prior to fill  placement or other activities such as construction, demolition, clearing land, landscaping, etc., within 30  metres of a wetland or watercourse.

They are  permanently in place and require no additional action by property owners or occupants at the time of a  flood. Examples are contained in the following sections.     Sewage Connections and Lot Drainage    The following measures will benefit any dwelling, regardless of location with respect to flooding. They  focus on addressing issues associated with roof drainage, plumbing, municipal utilities, and lot grading.  They include:      Improved lot grading and channels to direct water away from buildings   Foundation drains to direct groundwater away from the foundation   Eaves trough downspouts that are not connected to foundation drains and are extended   away from the building wall   A basement sump pump (with appropriate capacity and stand-by electrical power ) connected   to a storm sewer or a free-flowing surface outlet. Avoid connecting the sump pump to the  sanitary sewer    Basement window wells (where warranted by site grading), to ensure that window sills are  above the adjacent ground surface     Valves that prevent backflow (from a municipal sewer or septic system) from entering the  building. Sewer backups can cause major damage and inconvenience and occur when sewer  outlets become flooded and water is forced back through the sewer line into a building. It is  important to remember that buildings can be affected even if situated in areas where there is  no flooding.      The above measures are described in detail in guidance prepared by the City of Moncton, called The  Homeowner’s Guide to Flood Protection available at:   http://www.moncton.ca/Assets/Government+English/Publications+English/Flood+protection+manual.pdf    Additional information is also provided in Floodproofing for Utilities on page 16.    Dry Floodproofing    Dry floodproofing means closing off or relocating all openings in a building wall or foundation that  otherwise might allow flood water to enter a building. For example, windows, doors and other openings  located below the anticipated flood depth can be permanently closed in and sealed. Any water-resistant  material of sufficient strength can be used (e.g. bricks, concrete blocks, glass bricks, etc.). Once closed  in, the openings can no longer be used, so this measure should only be used if the windows and doors  are not needed by the building occupants and are not required in order to meet the requirements of the  National Building Code and National Fire Code.     Waterproof coatings or sealants can be applied to basement floors and foundation walls to reduce or  eliminate seepage.  Cracks or gaps can be filled in with sealants and a continuous waterproof membrane  can be used to line the outside of the foundation. Membranes may be susceptible to damage when  backfill is placed, so proper installation is important.  Special attention is also required for any openings     6     used for utilities such as electricity, telephone, propane, natural gas, sewer and water, to prevent  infiltration and leakage into the building.     The above measures can be used in combination with temporary flood shields and watertight doors as  described under Contingency (Temporary) Floodproofing Measures on page 13.    It’s important to know that although it may be technically feasible to seal the openings in external walls  and foundations to create a watertight barrier, it’s not always a good idea because other parts of the  building wall or foundation may still fail during a flood. The structural integrity of even well-built, modern  homes may be threatened if saturated ground extends above the basement floor elevation or if the flood  level is higher than the top of the foundation. Therefore, in order to reduce the potential for severe  structural damage, expert advice should be obtained before installing closures, sealants and  other flood barriers that are integrated into the building walls and foundation. A qualified expert  can determine if the walls, foundation and basement floor are strong enough to withstand the  weight of water pressing on the building from the outside (called hydrostatic pressure).     No matter what type of foundation is used, the building should be anchored to prevent flotation or lateral  movement in the event of a flood.    Wet Floodproofing    In any location where floodwater is expected to reach the outside of a building or foundation wall, the  resultant water pressure can be so severe that foundations can collapse and buildings can be heaved out  of the ground, or off their foundations. Where pervious (sandy) soils allow water to move easily through  the ground, this damage could happen even if no water is visible at the surface. In these circumstances,  wet floodproofing (purposely allowing the water to enter the building so that the pressures on the interior  and exterior of the building are balanced) may help prevent serious structural damage.  While the building  interior (in particular the basement) will receive some flooding, measures can still be taken to reduce the  potential for damage due to wetting of the building structure or contents.    Wet floodproofing requires that openings be provided to all  enclosed spaces below the anticipated flood elevation. The  idea is to reduce water pressure by letting it enter the  enclosed spaces at the same rate that the floodwaters rise  outside. The building should also be anchored to prevent  lateral movement.       When using wet floodproofing it is also important to ensure  that any structural materials (beams, subfloors, insulation,  framing etc.) and finishing materials (wall coverings, flooring,  etc.) that may be exposed to flood waters are resistant to  damage from wetting and drying (e.g. swelling and cracking)  and can be cleaned once the flooding has subsided. Even  materials that will not come into direct contact with flood  waters should be capable of resisting moisture and humidity. In general, materials such as untreated  wood, particle board, carpeting, corkboard, plaster, regular plywood, gypsum drywall, laminate flooring,  linoleum, vinyl wall coverings, non-ceramic floor tiles, etc., should be avoided. Batt and blanket types of  insulation such as mineral wool or fibreglass should also be avoided because they will retain water and   Case Study: The “Spray and Wash”  Basement    Last June, a homeowner’s basement  took in five feet of water.  The fully  finished basement had to be gutted. If  it happens again, cleanup should be  much easier. The rebuilt basement  now includes metal stairs, polished  concrete floors, and walls clad in foam  insulation covered with mortar and  steel mesh and coated in concrete  and sealant.    CBC Calgary, March 20, 2014    7     trap any floating contaminants.  Alternative materials include marine grade plywood, cement board,  concrete, glazed clay tile, plastic lumber (with no wood filling), non-absorbent natural or artificial stone or  stone veneer with waterproof grouting, steel wall panels, ceramic or concrete tile (with mortar rather than  an adhesive), metal doors, closed cell or plastic foam insulation, etc.     When wet floodproofing is employed, the dwelling owner or occupant should also prepare a plan listing  vulnerable furnishings and possessions along with a predetermined strategy for removing them quickly to  a location above the flood elevation.  In addition provision should be made for dewatering (pumping out  and dehumidifying) the basement once the flood is over. Other measures associated with wet  floodproofing, including special considerations for electrical services are described under Floodproofing  for Utilities on page 16.     If a building may be subject to damage from waves, floating ice, or debris during a flood then wet  floodproofing is not a good option.  Another caution regarding wet floodproofing is that during cold  weather, water that enters a building can freeze and expand, causing additional damage. Therefore, wet  floodproofing may not be the best option if other alternatives are available.       Below Grade Living Space     Basements are the lowest part of a building and are therefore most susceptible to flooding.  In early  homes, basements were usually not considered as living space and were more often used as storage  areas.  In modern homes, basements are often finished with wall coverings and flooring and are used as  recreation rooms, bedrooms or as fully-equipped apartments.    Finished basements and their contents are highly vulnerable to flood damage. To avoid risks to life and  property, wet floodproofing should not be used to accommodate below grade living space in  buildings that may be affected by sudden or rapid flooding.  While dry floodproofing (employing  measures to seal off a basement to keep flood water out) might seem to be the best solution, this may not  be a feasible option. As previously noted, even if the water is not flowing quickly, the weight of water  pressing in on a watertight building wall or foundation could result in significant structural damage.          Raising the Building    Raising a building above the flood level may reduce potential damage to a building and its contents in the  event of a flood.  For locations where flood hazard maps or sea level predictions are available, the  appropriate elevation can be obtained by referring to the past or predicted flood elevations. (See Finding  Flood Information in New Brunswick on page 22). Even if the flood water is higher than expected and  enters the building, the flood damage will be reduced, since the depth of the water and the length of time  the building's contents are exposed will be less. Including some extra height above the anticipated flood  level offers an additional margin of safety.    Elevation on Fill    This option means constructing a mound and relocating the building on top of it. Care should be taken in  the selection of the fill material Silts and very uniform sands are undesirable as they are difficult to  compact. Instead the fill material should include well-graded sands and gravels since they are the most  suitable for supporting the weight of buildings. Ensuring proper fill compaction is also important. This is  usually addressed by placing the fill in a series of layers or “lifts” and compacting each layer before the  next is added.      8       Placing fill overtop of organic soils can lead to  instability. The existing topsoil and subsoil may  have to be removed first and replaced with  another material (sand, gravel, synthetic  materials etc.) to provide the needed bearing  capacity. The sides of the fill should be  protected against erosion, and sloped in such a  way as to prevent slumping. The fill should not  extend onto adjacent properties, so it is also  important to know the location of property  boundaries.  Retaining a professional engineer  and a land surveyor will help ensure that each of  the above considerations is adequately  addressed.    Elevating an existing building on fill may not  be feasible in locations where flood waters  flow deep and fast because: a) the required  volume and depth of fill will be large; b) the  fill may be subject to erosion by flowing  water; c) safe access may not be available  during a flood and d) the fill may block flood  flow, leading to higher flood elevations on  adjacent properties. Effective use of this  option is therefore generally limited to  buildings located near the edges of flood  hazard areas. In addition, a Watercourse and  Wetland Alteration Permit is required prior to fill  placement or other activities such as  construction, demolition, clearing land,  landscaping, etc., within 30 metres (100 feet) of  a wetland or watercourse. Those considering  fill placement in coastal areas should also  consult New Brunswick’s Coastal Areas  Protection Policy.      The foundation of a building raised on fill may  still be subject to flood damage if the basement  floor remains below the anticipated flood  elevation. Flood water can damage the  foundation by exerting pressure on it if the water  is able to percolate through the fill. Special   foundation design and use of anchors to prevent  buoyancy may be required.  Construction on a  concrete slab placed on top of the fill (i.e. a  foundation with no basement) may an option.      A house on fill, during a St. John River flood       9      Elevation on a Raised Foundation, Piers or Columns    This option means designing and reconstructing a building foundation that is high enough to ensure that  the living area of a building is raised above the anticipated flood level. This requires that the building be  separated from its existing foundation, raised on hydraulic jacks, and held by temporary supports while a  new or vertically extended foundation is constructed below. This retrofit is typically most feasible for wood  frame homes originally built on basement, crawlspace, or open foundations. Masonry homes can be more  difficult to lift, primarily because of their design, construction, and weight, but raising these homes may  still be possible.     The new foundation can consist either of continuous  concrete walls designed to address hydrostatic  pressure, or an open foundation comprised of a  series of piers, posts, columns, or piles. Regardless  of the foundation type, the foundation design should  consider issues such as debris loading during a flood  event, the position and orientation of the supports,  soil conditions, and anchoring, bracing and  connection details. Expert advice should be retained  to design the foundation and supervise its  construction.     Elevating a building on piers and columns instead of  a foundation wall may be useful for coastal locations  and inland locations exposed to high velocity flow or  ice jams, because flowing water, waves, ice and  debris may be able to pass under the building without  causing impact-related damage. The supporting piers  and columns and their footings should be designed to  support the building weight and withstand the force of  moving water as well as the impact of ice and debris.  Mechanically driven piles may be the best solution  where erosion is expected to be severe, such as  exposed coastal locations. The open area under the  building can be used for other purposes such as  storage space for low value items.    When planning an elevated foundation, it’s important to determine how high the foundation should be.  (See Finding Flood Information in New Brunswick on page 22). When selecting the appropriate  elevation it may be wise to add some extra elevation to account for uncertainties in the water level  estimate.    Remember that use of this option is subject to the approval of the planning authority (municipality,  regional municipality, rural community, Regional Service Commission of the province as the case may  be). This option does not provide for safe access to a property during a flood. A Watercourse and  Wetland Alteration Permit is required prior to fill placement or other activities such as  construction, demolition, clearing land, landscaping, etc., within 30 metres of a wetland or  watercourse.  Those considering elevating a building on a raised foundation in coastal areas  should also consult New Brunswick’s Coastal Areas Protection Policy.              A    Permane   Floodwall keep wate structure.  the buildi the buildin   Floodwall imperviou or earthen specific c the eleva anticipate pressure  water outs     Ground e survey fro while floo methods  Informati ability of a imperviou should be   Important barrier to  seepage  buried be    A cottage on p on G  nt Floodwall  s and berms er away from This approa  ng itself and ng envelope i  s can be  us materials s n fill.

If such pipes extend beyond the limits of the barrier, they will  have to be equipped with backflow preventers or manually operated shut-off valves. See also Sewage  Connections and Lot Drainage (Page 5) and Floodproofing Utilities (Page 16). Remember that once  a valve on a sewer pipe is closed, sewage from the building will be blocked and may overflow if sinks,  toilets etc. are used.     Consideration should also be given to drainage of the area within the berm. This means that snow melt  and precipitation must be allowed to drain away from the building and through the barrier via pipes or  channels that can be closed off during flooding. Finally, driveways or other gaps in the barrier must be  blocked when a flood occurs. Sandbags or other equivalent materials can be kept on hand for this  purpose (see Temporary Dikes on page 14).     As is the case with construction on fill, the use of floodwalls or berms is not recommended in  locations where flood waters flow fast and deep since the wall or berm will have to be high and  may be subject to scour and erosion. In addition the wall or berm may block or deflect flood flow,  leading to higher flood elevations on adjacent, unprotected properties. Sudden failure of a flood  wall or berm may have greater safety or damage consequences than if the wall or berm had not  been constructed. Those intending to construct a flood wall or berm should confirm that these  features are permitted by the planning authority (municipality, regional municipality, rural community,  Regional Service Commission or the province as the case may be). A Watercourse and Wetland  Alteration Permit is required prior to fill placement or other activities such as construction,  demolition, clearing land, landscaping, etc., within 30 metres of a wetland or watercourse. Fill  placement within a wetland will generally not be permitted. Those considering construction in  coastal areas should also consult New Brunswick’s Coastal Areas Protection Policy.    Relocation    Relocation means moving an existing building that is vulnerable to flooding to a site that is above the  flood elevation. If flood risk is severe and alternative locations are available, this may be the most  effective floodproofing option. This option involves retaining a specialist contractor to lift an existing  building from its foundation and transport it to a new foundation at the new site.      When deciding whether or not relocation is a feasible option, factors to consider include the:     type of building (the easiest structures to relocate are single story wood frame buildings with a  regular, rectangular shape);    condition of the structure (is it structurally sound so that it can be moved?);    route between the existing site and the new one (are there low power lines, narrow roads, weight   restrictions, tight corners, etc. that will have to be addressed?);    characteristics of the new site (elevation above flooding, safe access during flooding, ability to   provide services such as well and septic system, etc.);    permits that may be required including building permits and permits for over-size/overmass loads   from the Department of Transportation and Infrastructure; and   relative costs of relocation versus demolition and reconstruction.       12     Temporary Floodproofing Measures     Temporary floodproofing measures are put into place  immediately before a flood and are intended to keep  water out of a building for the flood’s duration.  Contingency measures are sometimes referred to as  “active floodproofing” because they require human  intervention in advance of a flood. They are therefore  only useful if sufficient warning time is available to allow  floodproofing measures to be deployed and the building  owner or another knowledgeable person is available to  put the measures in place. Where possible, floodproofing  measures that are permanently in place are preferred.     Flood Shields    Flood shields are removable watertight barriers designed  to prevent the passage of water through windows and  doors. They consist of panels constructed of a durable,  impervious material (usually metal) that can be readily  installed and sealed using rubber gaskets or special  sealants around the edges.    To ensure quick and easy installation during a period of  immanent flood risk, flood shields should be stored close  to the openings to be sealed, color-coded or numbered  as to location and installation priority and held in place  by simple, quick connecting fasteners and latching  devices.     To ensure that flood shields will be effective when  installed, periodic inspection and testing is advised.    Watertight Doors and Temporary Bulkheads    Watertight doors are permanently installed, but are  designed to be closed and sealed only during floods.  They are heavy and expensive and are generally more  suited to commercial and industrial buildings than  houses. In locations where anticipated flood elevations  will not greatly exceed ground level, bolt-on, partial flood  panels or barriers can be installed to protect the bottom  portion of a doorway.       It is important to realize that in order to be effective,  flood shields and watertight doors must be well- maintained and incorporate smooth, close-fitting  surfaces, waterproof gaskets and locking bolts.  In     13     general, permanent closures or sealants, or  relocating doors and windows above the flood  level are more effective measures.    To prevent flood waters from entering through doors  and windows a temporary wall or “bulkhead” can be  constructed. For example “tongue and groove”  wooden planks can be stacked on top of each other.  The temporary wall can be covered by a plastic sheet  and supported by a grooved concrete or steel channel  attached to the sides of the door or window. A double  layer of sandbags placed at the base may help to  reduce seepage and provide additional stability.    As is the case for closures and sealants, expert  advice should be obtained to determine if flood  shields, watertight doors and bulkheads are  feasible options, based on the anticipated depth of  flooding.    Temporary Dikes    Stacking sandbags to form a barrier against rising  floodwaters is a common emergency floodproofing  technique. They can be put in place to surround a  vulnerable building or can be installed as needed to  protect low openings such as basement windows,  patio doors, etc. The bags must be strong enough to  hold the sand in place and withstand prolonged  contact with water. Burlap and plastic bags can be  purchased that are specially made to be filled with sand.    Flood water will exert pressure against the dike so if  possible, a trench should be dug to anchor the dike to  the ground and prevent it from moving.    Leaving some vacant space within the bags will allow  the bags to overlap and mold together under their own  weight, locking them in place. In addition, the orientation  of the bags should alternate, so that each layer of bags  is placed at right angles to the layers above and below.  This adds stability to the structure. For added protection,  a durable plastic sheet can be placed on the outer side  of the dike to prevent the seepage of water through the  barrier.      A number of alternatives to sandbags have been  devised, including re-usable, anchored, rubber or     14     rubberized tubes filled with water, interlocking panels designed to hold back flood water and various other  modular barriers constructed of high density materials, anchored in place and filled with sand or water to  increase their weight. These may be worthwhile options to consider and may be easier to install than  sandbags. If selected, they should be installed in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations.          15     Floodproofing for Utilities     If the utilities serving a building are damaged, even a structurally  sound residence may be rendered uninhabitable after a flood due  to unsafe or unsanitary conditions. This risk can be reduced by  incorporating floodproofing features into the services contained in  existing buildings. This is particularly important when furnaces and  other vulnerable facilities are located in a basement and when wet  floodproofing is being employed.  When floodproofing building  utilities, primary consideration should be given to preventing flood  waters from contacting the components that are most susceptible  to water damage.       Some potential measures are included in Table 1 (below), and  described in more detail in references contained in Additional  Information on Floodproofing at the end of this booklet.     Remember:    All measures and modifications must adhere to the all  applicable provisions of the National Building Code and  National Fire Code.     Building, locating, relocating, demolishing or altering a building or structure typically requires a  permit.     Check with your local planning authority for specific requirements and restrictions.     Table 1: Some Common Methods of Floodproofing Utilities      Floodproofing Measure Advantages Disadvantages    Electrical Services    Locate electrical panels, light  switches, meters, service entries and  electrical outlets above the  anticipated flood elevation.     Install separate, waterproof circuits  for outlets, switches, and lighting  components that must be located  below the flood level and install  separate circuits for emergency flood  equipment (e.g. pumps and  generators).           1. Elevated circuitry is completely  protected from damage.    2. May avoid costly “behind the wall”  failures in the event of a flood.         1. Not always easily adaptable to  existing buildings.     If wiring must be located below the  flood elevation, install it within a  small diameter plastic pipe (conduit)  to facilitate future replacement and  repair of wiring.     1. May avoid costly “behind the wall”  failures.   1. Not always easily adaptable to  existing buildings.   Case Study: The “Upside-Down  House”    When a property was badly  damaged by flooding, a local  builder saw an opportunity.  “You  have to find unique spots for the  mechanical equipment that  normally you would cram in a  basement”. The basement has no  windows and contains only piping  and ductwork. A small upstairs  room houses one of two furnaces  — designed to force air down  rather than up — complete with  sound insulation.    The Medicine Hat News,  September 4, 2014     16     Heating, Ventilating and   Air Conditioning (HVAC) Systems     Elevate all components (external  units, internal units, thermostats,  controls and ducting). For example,  subject to all applicable Building  Code and Fire Code requirements,  major components of the heating  system can be elevated on a  platform, strapped to the basement  ceiling or located on the main floor.  Lateral or in-line furnaces are also  available that fit into the ductwork.  External heat pump condensers can  be placed on elevated platforms or  attached to the building wall above  the anticipated flood elevation.     If forced air ducting cannot be  relocated above the flood elevation  then make sure the ducts below the  flood elevation are easily accessible  and can be taken apart for cleaning  after the flood event. (Sediment and  contaminants in the ducts can be  circulated through the HVAC system  if it is operated with dirty ducts).           1. No human intervention needed.             1. May be difficult and expensive to  introduce into existing buildings.     Locate heating or cooling system  components in waterproof utility  enclosures. Depending on the  anticipated flood depth, low barriers  or curbs rather than complete  enclosures may be sufficient.             1. May be difficult and expensive to  introduce into existing buildings.    2. The requirement to access the  components for servicing may limit  the effectiveness of the enclosure.     3. In some applications, the  enclosure is normally open and must  be closed and sealed before the  flood arrives.     Incorporate quick release/disconnect  features into the design of the  equipment to allow rapid removal of  vulnerable components.    1. Potentially allows rapid shut down  and relocation of vulnerable  components.   1. May not be feasible for all  components or may require custom- designed components.    2. Requires human intervention to  remove and relocate vulnerable  components in advance of a flood.     Water Supply and Sewers    Install back-flow prevention valves  on sewage pipes.        1. Valves function automatically to  prevent sewage from backing up into  the building when flooding occurs.         1. Valve requires testing and  maintenance.     2. Once a valve on a sewer pipe is  closed, drainage from the building  will be blocked and may overflow if  sinks, toilets etc. are used     17       Eliminate gravity drains below the  anticipated flood level.     1. Prevents sewage from backing up  when flooding occurs.    2. Potentially useful if flow prevention  valves on sewer lines are not  feasible.     1. A pump and generator are  required.    2. May not be technically feasible or  permitted especially for hook-ups to  municipal sewers.   Install a waterproof well casing to  prevent surface water from entering  the well. Protect the well top from  scour and impact damage.   1. Helps prevent contamination of  water supply by bacteria and other  pollutants during a flood.         If possible, ensure that the septic  system is located above the  anticipated flood elevation. If this is  not possible, Install a watertight cap  (e.g. bolted with neoprene gasket) to  keep surface water out of the septic  tank and install a valve to prevent  sewage backflow during a flood.        1. May prevent sewage backflow  from entering to building.      1. Sewage system may be  inoperable during the flood.    2. Buoyancy forces on underground  septic tanks located below the flood  elevation may lead to damage and  failure of the septic system.    Fuel Supply    Install shutoff valves, waterproof fill  caps, and make sure tank vents  extend above the anticipated flood  level. If evacuation is necessary,  close fuel valves before leaving the  site.       1. Reduces risk of fire and explosion.    2. Prevents building damage and  pollution due to fuel leaks.    3. Adaptable to most buildings.        1. Minor post-flood maintenance may  be required.       If oil and propane storage tanks  cannot be located above the flood  elevation, brace and anchor them to  prevent flotation, separation of fuel  lines/pipes, and damage to tanks  and fuel lines (due to scour, erosion,  and impact from floating debris).       1. Reduces risk of fire and explosion.    2. Prevents building damage and  pollution due to fuel leaks.    3. Adaptable to most buildings.       1. Minor post-flood maintenance may  be required.

These  products should therefore be securely stored to prevent their release during a flood. To reduce the risk of  contamination:      Clearly identify and label contents of, drums, or other containers, especially when materials are  placed in other than their original containers;    Place your name and address on larger fuel and propane tanks to facilitate identification of their  contents and their return if they become displaced;    Store drums and containers in areas that are least susceptible to flood waters. When possible,  keep them in fenced enclosures, cabinets, or storerooms;    Minimize the amounts and types of materials kept on site. Purchase only what you need;   If time permits dispose of household hazardous waste materials prior to a flood, at a household   hazardous waste collection centre. For more information on how to dispose of household  hazardous waste materials, contact your local Solid Waste Commission.             How t    1.

Remember that the proposed  work must comply with all applicable building code, fire code, by-law and building permit requirements.  Some planning authorities may prohibit construction within a flood hazard area. In addition, any  applicable provincial permits must be obtained. For example a Watercourse and Wetland Alteration  Permit is required prior to fill placement or other activities such as construction, demolition, clearing land,  landscaping, etc., within 30 metres (100 feet) of a wetland or watercourse.  Those considering  construction in coastal areas should also consult New Brunswick’s Coastal Areas Protection Policy.    7. Select an appropriate method of floodproofing. Always seek expert advice about the best way to  floodproof your home because improper floodproofing selection and design can put people and property  at risk.    8. Plan your floodproofing project and hire experts to do the work. Use a licensed, bonded, and  insured contractor. Before hiring a contractor, be sure to check references.    9. Know the extent of the remaining flood risk, because it can’t be eliminated entirely.          21     Finding Flood Information in New Brunswick    Flood Hazard Maps and Flood Level Predictions    In New Brunswick, flood hazard maps have been prepared for a number of areas that are known to be at  risk of flooding. The maps describe the extent and anticipated frequency of flooding, and can be used to  obtain flood depths at specific locations. New Brunswick’s flood hazard maps can be viewed and  downloaded at:      http://www2.gnb.ca/content/gnb/en/departments/elg/environment/content/flood.html    In addition, predicted sea levels have been calculated for all of coastal New Brunswick, taking into  account the effects of high tides, storm surges and future sea level rise. This information is available in  Updated Sea-Level Rise and Flooding Estimates for New Brunswick Coastal Sections (2014).  https://atlanticadaptation.ca/en/islandora/object/acasa%3A731    Some coastal communities have prepared coastal flood hazard maps. Check with your local planning  authority.     Other Sources of Information    Not all of New Brunswick’s flood-prone locations have been identified on flood hazard maps and  properties throughout the province may occasionally be impacted by localized flooding due to high water  levels in rivers, streams and ditches, high groundwater levels, local drainage issues, and low elevation.  Other potential sources of flood information include local planning authorities, media reports, historical  records contained in public libraries and your own personal experience. Long-term residents can also be  excellent sources of information on the history of flooding in your area. Predictions based on site-specific  calculations performed by an engineering consultant can also be used as a guide.
