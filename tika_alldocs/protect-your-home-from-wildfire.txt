ISNBN: 978-0-9784841-9-4 Copyright®2011 The Institute For Catastrophic Loss Reduction  About the Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction  The Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction (ICLR), established in 1997, is a world-class centre for multidisciplinary disaster prevention research and communication. ICLR is an independent, not-for-pro!t research institute founded by the insurance industry and af!liated with the University of Western Ontario.  The Institute’s mission is to reduce the loss of life and property caused by severe weather and earthquakes through the identi!cation and support of sustained actions that improve society’s capacity to adapt to, anticipate, mitigate, withstand and recover from natural disasters.  ICLR’s mandate is to confront the alarming increase in disaster losses caused by natural disasters and to work to reduce disaster deaths, injuries and property damage. Disaster damage has been doubling every !ve to seven years since the 1960s, an alarming trend.   The greatest tragedy is that many disaster losses are preventable.  ICLR is committed to the development and communication of disaster prevention knowledge. This document identi!es the steps you can take to better protect your home from wild!res.  ICLR-SL Wildfire-D14 Jun18 12 E-FINAL_x  12-06-18  12:28 PM  Page B    1  Fire is a natural process essential to maintain healthy forests. Wildland !res can also be a terrifying peril that threatens lives and property.  Wild!res burn on average 20,000 km2 of forest each year in Canada. When these !res approach our communities they can force families  to evacuate. In !ghting these !res, !re!ghters are sometimes called upon to make decisions on which properties can be defended and which cannot.   Over the last several centuries, large parts of Canada have burned repeatedly. 50 per cent of Canada’s wild!res are caused by people. Most of the other half is caused by lightning strikes on dry forest. This is why the risk of wild!res is highest in the summer.   If you live in or near a forested area, you’re living in an area often referred to as the wildland/urban interface and sooner or later you may have to contend with a wild!re. The risk of wild!res is increasing in many parts of Canada and your best protection against loss, damage or injury is prevention.   ICLR has partnered with the Government of Alberta to distribute the FireSmart Home Owners Manual. This material details the speci!c actions that Canadians should take in order to protect their homes from wild!res.   Wild!res  Ph ot  o:  S  hu tt  er st  oc k  ICLR-SL Wildfire-D14 Jun18 12 E-FINAL_x  12-06-18  12:28 PM  Page 1    2  Get ready  Properly preparing your home and community doesn’t completely guarantee you won’t incur !re damage, but it does reduce the risk. Make sure you have adequate insurance on your home and property.  Some of the measures in this manual cost very little and help reduce your vulnerability to wild!re; others require planning and a long-term commitment.  Let’s look at three areas where you can apply FireSmart principles to protect or reduce the damage to your property from a wild!re.   1. Site preparation  Any kind of vegetation is combustible.  Mature trees, shrubs, grass and even your woodpile can easily ignite and increase the chance of wild!re damaging your home and property. Managing the space around your home and buildings is of utmost importance.  Do you have a cleared zone around your house and buildings?  The 10-metre space immediately surrounding your home is Priority Zone 1. It’s the most critical area to introduce FireSmart principles.  A fuel-free space will give !re!ghters a chance to save your home from an advancing wild!re. A home without a fuel-free space can make !re!ghting dif!cult, if not impossible.   What to do?  Remove "ammable trees and shrubs, such as pine, spruce and juniper. Other species such as aspen, poplar and birch have lower "ammability rates. Also remove deadfall or woodpiles from this area. Keep your grass mowed and watered.  10 m 20 m  70 m  Priority zone 1  Priority zone 2  Priority zone 3  Priority zones surronding an interface building or group of buildings.  ICLR-SL Wildfire-D14 Jun18 12 E-FINAL_x  12-06-18  12:28 PM  Page 2    3  How FireSmart is your “Second Priority” zone?  The area extending from 10 to 30 metres away from your home is Priority Zone 2. In this zone, you need to reduce fuels by thinning and pruning trees so that intense wild!res don’t have as much fuel to burn.  What to do?  Remove any trees and debris that would support the rapid spread of  a wild!re. Make sure to thin or space trees so that the crowns (tops)  of individual trees are at least 3 to 6 metres apart.   Remove tree branches up to 2 metres from the ground. Also remove thick shrubbery and deadfall to reduce the chance that a wild!re will climb up into the forest canopy. Once a wild!re is crowning, it’s very dif!cult to stop.  Because !res spread more easily uphill and downwind it’s important  to extend Priority Zone 2 further on downhill slopes and on windward exposures.   Can you extend your FireSmart maintenance plan to the “Third Priority” zone?  Priority Zone 3 begins 30 metres from your home and extends to a distance of 100 metres and beyond. In this zone the objective is not to remove all combustible fuels from the forest, but to thin the area so !res will be low- intensity and more easily extinguished.   What to do?  Thin or reduce the shrubs and trees that make up the understory. Try to keep !re-resistant trees such as aspen, poplar and birch, while spacing more "ammable trees so that each individual crown is at least 3 to 6 metres apart.   Low stand density where trees are widely spaced.  Tree crowns do not touch or overlap.

To ensure years of protection, make sure you maintain your FireSmart Priority Zones.   2. Building construction The second set of FireSmart guidelines deals with building materials and design standards. While it may not be practical or economical to apply all of them to an existing structure, many FireSmart modi!cations are easily accomplished. Others can be included in long- term maintenance or renovation plans, and incorporated in new structures as they are designed and constructed.   Is your roof FireSmart?  The most !re-resistant roo!ng materials are metal, clay tile and asphalt shingles. Untreated wooden shakes and shingles provide no resistance. They are ideal fuels for an advancing wild!re.   Lawn or non-combustible material  ! within 10 metres of building (0 pts).  ! within 10 to 30 metres of building (0 pts).   Metal, clay tile, asphalt shingles, or non-combustible material (0 pts) – the most !re resistant and remain effective under severe !re exposure.  Unrated wood shakes (30 pts) – provide no !re protection.

Are your exterior walls FireSmart?  Materials such as stucco, metal, brick and concrete offer superior resistance to wild!re. Logs and heavy timber are less effective, and wood and vinyl siding offer very little protection.  Is the exterior of your home vulnerable to !rebrand ignition?  If you are designing your home, eliminate areas where !rebrands (airborne sparks and embers) could accumulate and ignite siding, windowsills or trim. Exterior siding should be !re-resistant and extend from ground level to the roo"ine.   Eaves and vents are ready-made openings that can allow heat and embers to enter a building and ignite. Ensure eaves are closed in and  Non-combustible siding (0 pts)  Materials such as stucco, metal siding, brick cement shingles, concrete block, poured concrete, and rock offer superior !re resistance.  Closed eaves, vents screened with 3-millimetre mesh and accessible (0 pts)   Closed eaves, vents not screened with 3-millimetre mesh (1 pt)   Open eaves, vents not screened (6 pts)    ICLR-SL Wildfire-D14 Jun18 12 E-FINAL_x  12-06-18  12:28 PM  Page 5    6  screen all vents and sof!ts. Keep areas under decks and porches clear of debris and sheath the undersides with !re-resistant material.  Are your doors and windows FireSmart?  Be sure to remove "ammable forest fuels within 10 metres of glazed window and door openings. Tempered, thermal or smaller double-pane windows will provide far greater protection than single pane glass.    Tempered (0 pts) – optimum protection is provided by tempered glass.  Single pane (2 or 4 pts) Double pane (1 or 2 pts) – moderate protection is provided by double or thermal pane windows.

Don’t be the cause of a wild!re  Wild!res often start as small accidental ignitions. You can help prevent an accidental wild!re from starting by using FireSmart standards around your property.  FireSmart your chimney  Chimneys should be constructed to meet current building code requirements and have approved spark arrestors installed.  Burn barrels and !re pits  Burn barrels and !re pits should be located away from buildings and 3 metres away from other combustible material. Always ensure your burn barrel has proper ventilation and is covered with a screen. Never leave your burn barrel or !re pit unattended while it is in use. For a safer method of disposal bring your debris to a local land!ll site.   Power lines and propane tanks  Vegetation should be cleared away from power lines, propane tanks and other fuel supplies.  Emergency facilities  Ensure your property has adequate emergency vehicle access and an on-site emergency water supply, such as a pond, tank, creek or lake.   On-site !re tools Every home should have shovels, rakes, axes, garden hoses, sprinklers and ladders to assist in suppressing wild!res and protecting homes.  Contact utility companies for clearing of vegetation under overhead electrical installations.   Illustration not to scale.  Illustration not to scale.
