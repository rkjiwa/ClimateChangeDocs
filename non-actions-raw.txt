It is not uncommon for an engineer to request that the outputs from climate models be calibrated.  

If both the scientist and engineer use expressions such as “ground truth” or 
“validate” they will find that they are both keenly interested in testing climatic models against 
the historic record.

They may actually ask the scientist to offer an opinion regarding the overall veracity of the 
data and may express frustration if the scientist points to the variance of the data set and the 
differences between the models used to arrive at the data.

Scientists will typically use confidence 
intervals when reporting historical trends, and 
in that case
use confidence intervals in a 
manner consistent with engineers.  
This may turn into a circular argument as the engineer requires “a number” to work with while 
the scientist insists on providing ranges of equally likely future climate conditions. 


The scientist may view the engineers’ approach to the information to be quite different than their 
own.  
For example, the 
Vulnerability Ratio outlined in Step 4 of the 
PIEVC Protocol is a unitless index that is used 
to determine the relative vulnerability of an 
infrastructure component. 
 

Once again this confusion can be minimized if both parties clearly 
define the scope of the project and the content of the information packages being requested or 
offered.

Concerns about causes and effect

Damage 
resulting from climate change creates a financial burden on 
municipalities, and for those officials in municipal governments 
who must now plan for an uncertain future, strategies for 
adapting to climate change and mitigating against climate 
change are becoming extremely important. 


Even when climate 
change threats are understood, the localized nature of impacts 
and the seemingly distant timeframes involved can make it hard 
to design and implement policies designed to address climate 
change.
Simply put, adaptation 
is all about understanding climate impacts and effects, in order 
to undertake substantive actions that make communities and 
municipal investments more resilient to the harmful effects of 
weather and climate.
The foremost, is that many impacts and 
hazards associated with climate change translate into issues 

We can expect to live in a climate with 
different rainfall patterns, warmer temperatures, more frequent 
storms, and severe weather events.

In Canada, engineering is regulated under provincial and territorial law by the engineering regulators.
About the Canadian Engineering Qualifications Board


Principle # 2: Integrate climate mitigation into practice


Scientific literature indicates significant departures from historical climate averages occurring globally and engineering designs
must account for an expanded range of climate in their operating environments


This guideline uses terms that may not be used in an engineer’s day-to-day practice.
It is important to recognize that engineers have a higher standard of practice than a layperson.
In this way, the engineer will normally be held to a standard of practice that
exceeds that of a layperson but is somewhat less than that of an expert.
Resourcefulness: the capacity to mobilize needed resources and services in emergencies.

»


These professionals establish the
environment within which other professionals must function.
Consider using approaches that balance economic, environment and social (sustainability) considerations in
recommending and implementing adaptation measures.


»


In defining environmental impact assessment terms and conditions, include the requirement to explicitly identify and
explain the climate change implications to the proposed project.


Sources can be reduced in diverse ways, including using
fossil fuels more efficiently, switching to renewable energy sources, and reducing the carbon footprint of buildings.  
The following actions would help engineers integrate mitigation into their scope of practice and contribute to the goals of
sustainability.
»


Standards – for example, those dealing with energy efficiency –  should be
assessed to determine if they are reflective of current technological capabilities or are based on less efficient technology.


Inherent in engineering practice and professional judgment is the concept of the “factor of safety”.


»

High quality and consistency of materials, manufacturing, maintenance and inspection

»

Good control or knowledge of the actual loads and environment over the life cycle e.g. climate loads

»

Highly reliable analysis and/or experimental data


In so doing, it is important to consider all potential
loading conditions – even abusive loads.
Airplane designs employ both
concepts, making air travel one of the safest modes of transportation.
There are always conditions that are prohibitive to guard against.


3.5 Principle # 5: Interpret Climate Information

Consult with climate scientists and specialists


Weather is the day to day conditions with seasonal precessions through the year.
While these factors introduce some uncertainty into climate projections, the uncertainty can be managed through appropriate
data treatment and climate scenario development.
The following are some suggested actions to aid engineers in interpreting and assessing climate information.
Implementing Actions


Practitioners may possess more than one of the requisite skill sets.
»


As part of this communication, the engineer should clearly communicate the costs
and benefits of recommended actions and how those actions reduce the identified risks.
The decision maker may opt to reject or ignore the
professional’s recommendations.
For
climate change adaptation the question is a bit less certain as the case law on these matters is evolving.
Implementing such measures requires reporting on emissions and
reductions, which are roles where engineers can and should be involved.


3.8.2
Many large infrastructure systems are designed for an extended service life.
If climate
conditions change over that service life, it can be difficult to adapt the engineered system to the new environment without
wholesale changes to the system.
Projects that do not include consideration of climate in their scope may seem to be less costly for initial procurement.
These will be incorporated into the next
edition of this model guideline.

It can be used by any organization regardless of its size, activity or sector.

, Risk management - Vocabulary complements ISO 31000 by providing a collection of
terms and definitions relating to the management of risk.


With increasing
understanding of the scope and impact of climate change, engineers may be held accountable for anticipating the impacts of
climate change on their professional work.

Trucking firms are using technologies to reduce fuel consumption that also enhance 
climate resilience.
Provincial Professional Engineering Associations 
are responding by adding new professional 
requirements to ensure that potential climate 
change impacts are taken into account in the 
design process for the service life expected 
of the infrastructure.  
This is a cultural change 
for agencies responsible for infrastructure, 
consultants carrying out engineering design 
work and clients commissioning the work.  
It is 
expected that future engineering work related 
to new infrastructure design and rehabilitation 
will reflect such action and progress.

This is 
especially true in Nunavut and the Northwest Territories, where aviation ensures community resupply 
and transportation year-round.
However, the port is not suitable for larger vessels and currently features a shallow 32-km 
channel approach with sections less than 4m deep (Prolog Canada Inc, 2011).


The line is one of the most costly routes in CN’s network due to the 
challenging area of service; for instance, the rail bed is constructed on permafrost, which limits train 

The greatest observed warming, 2.6˚C for the 
period 1948-2014, has occurred in the Northwest 
Territories’ Mackenzie District (Environment Canada, 
2015).
Projections suggest that warming of the North 
will continue to be greater than in Canada as 
a whole, with the greatest warming occurring 
in winter and fall (Bush et al., 2014).

While operating 
windows have always varied by location and year, recent increases in surface air temperature and 
decreases in snow cover have reduced operating season length and maximum load capacity 
in many locations (Furgal and Prowse, 2008).
High-volume snowmelt may also result in flooding and increase pore water pressure 
and erosion, damaging permafrost (IMG-Golder Corporation Environmental Consulting, 2012).
This 
will have implications for roads, bridges at stream crossings, and slope stability.
The trend towards shorter operational seasons is already evident.

Snow removal allows freezing fronts to penetrate 
the ground faster, removing heat from the ground and promoting ice formation, while snow caches 
constructed near difficult land crossings allow overland sections to be rebuilt quickly
(points of congestion created by the layout of a network)
(Furgal and Prowse, 2008).

Methods to limit heat intake under roads include:
①	 Embankment thickening (e.g., increasing width and flatness) helps maintain permafrost conditions 

in cold or moderately cold regions (although not in relatively warmer northern regions, as the 
active permafrost layer may be too thick).

While referred to as “the Prairies” for simplicity in this chapter, the three provinces are quite distinct. 

One of the most significant is Crowsnest Pass, which acts as a conduit for rail and 
roadways between Alberta and British Columbia (Babaian, 1985).
Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices -
Key road-freight border crossings in the Prairies include Emerson (Manitoba), Coutts 
(Alberta), and North Portal (Saskatchewan).
In 2013, three of Canada’s top-ten freight-rail border crossings were located in the Prairies: Warroad, 
Minnesota-Sprague, Manitoba; Portal, North Dakota-North Portal, Saskatchewan; and Pembina, North 

Despite high year-to-year 
variability, long-term records demonstrate increasing mean annual temperatures, ranging from 
0.9˚C at Calgary, Alberta, to 2.7˚C in Swift Current, Saskatchewan for the period 1895-2005
In addition to significant variability between and among years, there is also significant spatial 
variability across the region.

Research suggests that May-June 
precipitation over the southeastern Prairies has increased significantly since the 1990s, possibly 
explaining observed changes in runoff patterns and recent extreme flood events (e.g. 2011 and 2014)

Increased rutting of heated pavement (Sauchyn and Kulshreshta, 2008).


•  Cost reductions associated with non-ice road infrastructure;

•  
Reduced cold-weather damage to rails (Sauchyn and Kulshreshtha, 2008).


Drought has also had negative impacts on road infrastructure in the Prairies.
This adaptive strategy includes 
elevating roads, increasing culvert capacities, redirecting water flows, and paving gravel roads to 
reduce washout risks (Transportation and the Environment Task Force, 2014).


Adjusting these programs cost very little

The PIEVC assessment identified risks to operations/maintenance (e.g. snow clearing) and serviceability/

Trucking firms have also devoted greater resources to weather monitoring, in some cases creating full-
time positions for real-time monitoring of weather events throughout a firm’s network.
This enhances trucking firms’ ability to quickly redirect traffic in 
response to traffic disruptions
Provincial governments also provide monitoring services to aid traffic flow.

Although thawing permafrost is the most significant climate change impact affecting Quebec’s 

northern communities, similar to the northern territories, rising temperatures are also reducing winter 
mobility due to shorter freezing periods.   
Acquiring data to monitor the condition of infrastructure and efforts to search for effective 
solutions for transportation systems are key means of adapting to the inevitable changes. 

For nearly 20 years, the Quebec government, carrier associations, expert panels, and companies 
have been making greater efforts to adapt transportation systems to climate change and thus 
strengthen its resilience.
More specifically, the Quebec population is concentrated in a few large urban areas in the southern 
part of the province (Montréal, Québec City, Gatineau, Sherbrooke, Trois-Rivières).
For example, Nunavik makes up a little less than one-third of the 
territory and has approximately 12,700 residents in 14 northern villages and the Cree community of 
Whapmagoostui.

Marine transportation is closely tied to a number of key sectors of the Quebec economy, and plays a 
major role in the movement of goods along the St. Lawrence corridor.
The main commercial ports in Quebec include the ports under the jurisdiction of Canadian port 
authorities in Montréal, Trois-Rivières, Québec City, Saguenay and Sept-Îles.
Demand for rail services has increased somewhat since 2001, both for the transportation of goods and 
travelers (Réseau des chemins de fer du Québec, 2011).
Regarding 
freight services, close to 146,000 tonnes, equivalent to $3.7 billion, were transported by the 380 air 
transportation companies in Quebec in 2010 (MTQ 2013a).


Figure 5: Simulated historical and future conditions of annual freezing degree days calculated from an 
ensemble of climate scenarios (n=11)
(Chaumont and Brown, 2010).
For some of these stations, the trends are 
associated with increases in spring and fall precipitation.


As in the case 
of temperatures, these increases will be more significant for extreme precipitation events than for 
averages.
In addition, the built environment in Quebec is aging, 
and certain transportation infrastructure is reaching the end of its useful life or needs considerable 
refurbishment (Canadian Infrastructure Report Card, 2012).
More than half of the St. Lawrence estuary and gulf coastlines are prone to erosion (Drejza et

In general, climate change vulnerabilities for rail transportation in Quebec are poorly documented.

CHAPTER 7:
Some infrastructure is showing signs 
of deterioration attributable to permafrost thaw (Guimond et al., 2010).
Extreme weather events also contribute to the vulnerability of air transportation in Nunavik.
Information and telecommunication networks can be affected by strong winds, thunderstorms, 
lightning, and ice.
Climate change will have both positive and negative effects on construction costs and the lifespan of 
land-based infrastructure (Doré et al., 2014).
The importance of transportation is also recognized in the current action plan on climate change 
entitled « Le Québec

As storm frequency and intensity increases, these impacts will likely continue to be severe. 


These technologies assist with risk 
assessment and help practitioners communicate the magnitude of short- and long-term impacts 
to decision-makers.

 

Literature examining the impacts of climate on transportation systems in Atlantic Canada is quite 
limited.
Atlantic Canada has a diversity of landscapes, including five distinct terrestrial ecozones (Environment 
Canada and Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, 1999).
Population


Newfoundland and 
Labrador is more closely connected to global supply chains than other Atlantic provinces, with 
approximately one-third of freight traffic destined for the United States, and one-third destined for the 
rest of the world (Lambert-Racine, 2013).


Increases have also been observed in sea-surface 
temperatures and ocean acidity (Loder et al., 2013).

The most severe regional-scale impacts are related to tropical or post-tropical storms, and associated 
with heavy precipitation, strong winds, and storm surges.
(Webster, 2012).  
In 1962, approximately 180 mm of rain 
on heavy snow on Prince Edward Island’s southern coast caused extensive washouts and damage 
to paved highways (Atlantic Climate Adaptation Solutions Association, 2011).
When temperatures ranged from -27°C to 7°C in the span of a month in Corner Brook, 
Newfoundland, mass snow-thaws resulted in the infiltration of large water volumes in short periods 
of time, overloading the capacity of stormwater management infrastructure (Rayna Luther, City of 
Corner Brook Infrastructure and Public Works, personal communication, 2015). 


Flood risks are a particular focus of these efforts.

(Finck, 2013).


For instance, to reduce spring flood risks in rural New Brunswick resulting from periods 
of rapid warming and snowmelt, the federal government invested $1.7 million in 2015 to proactively 
remove snow from the roadways of eight vulnerable First Nations communities.

Severe weather and shifting “average” conditions 
can therefore shorten infrastructure life spans, reduce performance, and increase maintenance and 
operating costs (McLeod and Stevanovic-Briatico, 2014).
Washouts (due to soil/slope 
instability when water infiltrates a roadway’s substructure) and flooding often result in delays, 
detours, and closures that reduce mobility and increase travel times for both automobiles and bus 
transit (United States Federal Highway Administration, 2015; Andrey and Mills, 2003).
Freezing rain is likely to become more frequent in many parts of Canada (Cheng et al., 2011), causing 
ice build-up, road blockages, and power outages due to fallen tree branches and utility lines, and 
posing risks to road safety in urban areas (Andrey, 2010; Andrey et al., 2013).
In extreme 
heat during summer months, softening, rutting, flushing, and bleeding of asphalt are expected to 
increase in frequency and severity (Mills and Andrey, 2002).
Softening and rutting occur when vehicles 
depress hot pavement
(Mills et al., 2009).
In addition, both extreme heat and cold may result in malfunctioning traffic control signals (

moisture seeps into small cracks, freezes and expands when cold returns, and melts (causing

The organization considers managing climate change risks important to service delivery and infrastructure 
maintenance/development, particularly given that it builds infrastructure to last 100 years.
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) applications, used heavily for public transit and traffic 
management, also depend upon telecommunications infrastructure that can be affected by extreme 
weather (Revi et al., 2014).
This has been experienced by the 
Toronto Transit Commission’s subway system in recent winters (McLeod and Stevanovic-Briatico, 2014).

Although temperature and 
precipitation seem to be changing 
slowly, the interaction between 
“gradual” changes and other factors 
can produce complex and sudden 
effects.
For example, a one degree increase in average 
annual temperature can mean 25 days where 
temperatures are 15 degrees above the seasonal 
normal if climate remains at normal levels the rest of 
the year.
Projected future changes in temperature and 
precipitation suggest that short-term extremes will 
happen more often (Streicker, 2016).  


(Guojian, et al., 2017).   


The biggest departure from 
average occurred in the central Yukon. 

 

A longer growing season that will allow more local agriculture and therefore more local food 

supply; 


“In the Yukon community members 
are reporting changes including: unpredictable weather, 
glaciers and permafrost are melting, wildlife migration 
patterns, new species, insect populations, increasing 
forest fires and different water levels.”
It has 

become more difficult to do that now. 

 

Lakes and streams are drying up or becoming choked with weeds, making the water 
undrinkable. 


Many animals are changing where they go and their behavior.
Ice Breakup on Yukon River in Dawson City  

Long-term community level impact information like the breakup data discussed here is valuable 
for measuring change, understanding the rate of change over time, and can help inform 
planning for the future.
The most striking example of 
this was the discovery of a Calliope Hummingbird in the summer of 2017
Health Canada’s Climate Change Health Adaptation Program has emphasized a community-

focused approach; projects address climate change-related needs identified by the 
community, strengthen a community’s adaptive capacity, and involve community members 
in the project’s results.
Furthermore, it is often difficult for many decision-makers to see 
tangible connections between the issues they are mandated to address and the interaction 
of these issues with climate change.

  Updated storm sewer standards. 


The mechanism by which climate change can be expected to result in increased wildfire risk 
includes greater risk of dry winters and dry summers (through increased precipitation variability 
despite average precipitation increasing) and through increased heat and desiccation of existing 
fuel sources.
One suggestion in the Whitehorse Community Adaptation Plan is to 
strategically place agricultural land developments as fire-breaks to reduce wildfire risk;  


  Encourage the increased use of fire-resistant building materials, including metal cladding, 

metal roofs and metal soffits, along with closing in areas under decks and porches, to 
provide better protection from wind-driven embers.
Risks to highway

When 
it comes to communities and watersheds, there 
may be as many different approaches to planning, 
as there are communities. 


Well / Aquifer Protection Plans

Water Management Plans
Communities rely on water and watersheds for a safe, secure and 
adequate supply of water for many uses; a receiving environment 
for wastewater discharges; provision of fish, wildlife, habitat and 
biodiversity; moderation of flooding, erosion and sedimentation 
processes; and a host of other social, cultural, economic and 
spiritual values.
Similarly, future climate scenarios can help

If a problem is defined too narrowly, innovative 
solutions may be overlooked.

 
While both salt water and freshwater are 
essential parts of the water cycle, the freshwater that we use on a 
daily basis for drinking water, irrigation, andother uses comprises only 
1% of all water on Earth.
When rain falls or snow melts too fast to allow for 
infiltration, or when the ground is too hard (impermeable) for 
infiltration to occur, such as in an urban environment, the water 
flows over the land as surface runoff (also called overland flow). 

This water will eventually leave the plant through the leaves, 
transpiring back into the atmosphere.
 
How we develop and manage the land within our 
watersheds ultimately affects the quality of the water that is available for 
use.

The following are some of the key 
elements and steps in preparing such a plan:

 
▪  
▪  
Evaluate the potential impacts of drought  
on the social & environmental well-being  
of the region;
 ▪  
▪ Individual Drought Response Measures;
 ▪ Resources; and
 ▪  
A proactive approach also enables 
farmers, ranchers, other businesses, institutions and households to assess the plans in 
advance of a drought and offer feedback.
A Water Use Plan is a formal agreement that clarifies how water will 
be shared among water licensees while still providing adequate flows 
for fish and wildlife.
As such, Water Use Plans can help resolve 
conflicts among competing water users.
Therefore, Water Use 
Plans may be an inappropriate or impractical approach to planning 
for groundwater resources at this time.
▪  
Under the water act the comptroller’s responsibility relates 
to amending waterpower licences and issuing orders to help 
implement: “operational changes, monitoring studies and physical 
works outlined in the plan”; and,
 
It is very 
important to undertake this type of planning before a watershed 
approaches its limits of available supply relative to future demands, 
and before drought or other extreme conditions threaten good 
relationships between stakeholders.
