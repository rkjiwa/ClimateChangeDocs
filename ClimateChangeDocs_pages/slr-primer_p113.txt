Key Provisions

In 2005, after extensive 
consultations with its 
municipalities, the RCM of Sept-
Rivières adopted this interim 
regulation for high erosion 
rate areas, based on the inter-
ministerial report findings.

Article 7 on construction indicates that within 
the non-construction zone, as defined in 
Appendix 1 and 2 of the regulation, as per 
the research findings of the inter-ministerial 
research on erosion rates: 
• no new construction; 
• no extension of habitable surface to existing 
buildings; 
• no re-construction permits for buildings that 
have been destroyed or damaged in an amount 
equal or greater than half the value of the 
building, for whatever cause; 
Some exception provisions apply and are 
stipulated. 
Article 8 on permissible work stipulates that 
individuals are only allowed to protect their 
properties from erosion through rebuilding 
sandbanks. All other structural measures 
(riprap, dikes, etc.) are prohibited, unless 
allowed for by special provision.
Appendices 1 & 2 establish setback lines for 
a 25 year protection period, according to the 
inter-ministerial report recommendations. 
Appendix 1 includes the maps and Appendix 
2 includes the charts with approximately 240 
different setback lines per land sector. Setbacks 
range from 30 to 180 metres, with some zones 
declared non constructible.
