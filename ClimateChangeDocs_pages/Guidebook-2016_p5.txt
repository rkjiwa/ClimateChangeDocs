FOREWORD 

The  “Guidebook  on  Climate  Scenarios:  Using  Climate  Information  to  Guide  Adaptation  Research  and 
Decisions” was first published in the fall of 2014 and has since proven to be a useful tool of reference for 
both the climate change adaptation community and for those wanting to communicate climate information 
to decision-makers.  Since its publication, the guidebook has been the subject of numerous presentations 
through different conferences, seminars, and webinars. It has also been tested through a series of workshops 
with users from different sectors of activity. Many of these presentations and workshops were designed to 
understand how the document was being used and to obtain specific feedback on the content presented in 
the guide. This updated version of the guidebook on climate scenarios was modified based on comments 
obtained by users throughout this process.

Both the original guidebook, the subsequent testing of the document, and this updated version were all 
funded  by  Natural  Resources  Canada  under  the  Adaptation  Platform  Program.  The  Platform’s  Regional 
Adaptation Collaborative (RAC) and Tools Working Group identified this as an important need for adaptation 
decision-making  which  would  build  on  the  results  of  the  RAC  and  Tools  Program  (2009-2012).  The  RAC 
and  Tools  Program  was  a  $35  million,  cost-shared  initiative  to  support  collaborative  action  towards  the 
development of resources and tools to help local practitioners and decision-makers reduce the risks and 
maximize opportunities arising from a changing climate.

Users of the Guidebook are invited to send questions and comments to Isabelle Charron :
