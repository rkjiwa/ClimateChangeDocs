Climate projections informing adaptation planning in Prince George
The City of Prince George (population 77 000) is situated at the confluence of the Nechako and upper Fraser rivers 
in central British Columbia. Flooding and the devastation of the region’s forests by the mountain pine beetle are 
the climate-related impacts of greatest concern to the community. In 2008, the City partnered with the University of 
Northern British Columbia (UNBC)70 to mainstream climate change adaptation into the city’s policies and programs.
The City and UNBC partnered with the Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium at the University of Victoria to produce 
a climate trends and projections report specific to the Prince George region.71 The report assessed historical 
trends (1918 to 2006) for precipitation, temperature and stream flow as well as projected changes (for the 2020s, 
2050s and 2080s) in temperature and precipitation using global climate models. UNBC and the City organized 
two adaptation workshops and other information events that brought together city staff, the public and key 
stakeholders to discuss approaches to dealing with climate change impacts. Climate experts from PCIC presented 
a summary of the projections at the workshops. Participants were asked to discuss the potential social, economic 
and environmental implications of the projected changes for Prince George and define key impacts for the city. The 
climate change projections were a useful tool for establishing a credible baseline from which workshop participants 
could engage and discuss impacts and adaptation actions. Prince George has since integrated the findings from the 
workshops, including recommended measures to reduce risks from forest fires and flooding, into the Integrated 
Community Sustainability Plan72 and draft Official Community Plan.
