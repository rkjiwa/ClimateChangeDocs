Ideally, the adaptations will be mainstreamed into regular business processes and 
included in regular business reviews and improvements over time. If not, consider 
creating a separate implementation plan and a team to monitor implementation and 
effectiveness. The first tasks of the implementation team should be to review and finalize 
the implementation plan and to secure the necessary internal and external support from 
key agencies.

A basic approach

A comprehensive 
approach

Operational 
considerations  

Integrate the adaptations into your existing strategic plans (e.g., strategic forest 
management plan), operational plans (e.g., annual work plan), and day-to-day decisions. 
Add the priority adaptations when you update each plan, or undertake a review to identify 
whether existing plans should be updated immediately. 

Effective communications and good working relationships will be extremely important to 
successful implementation of adaptations. In addition, implementation provides a great 
opportunity to work cooperatively and collaboratively with land management partners and 
other interested parties. Work with these stakeholders to secure needed resources, identify 
business process requirements, prioritize activities, agree on responsibilities, and identify 
feasible milestones. Working together to mainstream adaptations will help to create buy-in 
and should result in adaptations that are realistic and achievable.

To support buy-in and effective implementation, it will be essential to share the reasons for 
the adaptations with anyone who will be involved in implementing them (e.g., planners, 
government approvals staff, operations personnel, contactors, and forest workers). 
Remember that this will take time and resources. 

Strategic considerations  

Ensure that you have done everything you can to garner support from the various 
individuals and organizations that may be affected by the adaptation, both internal 
personnel (such as senior managers) and external interests (such as communities and 
neighboring land users).

6.4  Evaluate Adaptation Performance

6.4.1     The Theory
Insights and recommendations about management policies and practices gained 
by working through the worksheets in this guidebook represent a starting point for 
vulnerability assessment and adaptation. Confidence in the feasibility and effectiveness 
of some adaptations and in projections for future climate change may be low, so it is 
essential that individual adaptations and the entire SFM system be closely monitored 
and refined once recommendations for adaptation options have been made (see 
Williamson and Edwards 2014). As well, regardless of the acceptability and feasibility 
of the recommended adaptation actions, some vulnerability is likely to remain after 
implementation. Therefore, monitoring is an essential part of the vulnerability and 
adaptation assessment framework. The aim of monitoring is to track whether adaptations 
have been implemented, whether SFM objectives are being met under a changing 
climate, and whether residual vulnerability necessitates refinement of objectives or 
activities.
