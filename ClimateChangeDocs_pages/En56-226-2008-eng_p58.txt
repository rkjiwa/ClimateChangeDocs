(cid:129) Relocate existing development from at-risk coastal areas
(cid:129) Develop an effective early warning communication and response system for coastal storm events
(cid:129) Map areas prone to flooding

Strengthen public health care systems in areas of vulnerability
Increase protective interventions

(cid:129)
(cid:129)
(cid:129) Enhance public education on climate-change-related health matters
(cid:129)

Improve forest management to reduce fire risk, flooding, and retention of disease vectors (e.g.
FireWise and FireSmart programmes promote wildfire safety in the US and Canada)

(cid:129) Promote energy-efficient water disinfection for disaster recovery (e.g. “Ultraviolet (UV)

(cid:129)

Waterworks” requires less energy and can operate on or off of the electricity grid)
Incorporate low-power lighting systems into disaster relief programs, thereby promoting
independence from fuel-based lighting and batteries (e.g. new light-emitting diode (LED)
technologies make it possible to provide high-quality grid-independent light supplies that are far
more rugged, efficient, safe and cost effective than versions currently in use) 

(cid:129) Providing mechanical cooling (e.g. chilled beams and conventional air conditioning systems)
(cid:129)

Implementing heat health alert plans
(cid:129) Open designated cooling centres at public locations
(cid:129) Provide information to the public through local media
(cid:129) Provide bottled water
(cid:129) Create a heat information line to answer heat-related questions
(cid:129) Make emergency medical services with specially trained staff and medical equipment available

(cid:129) Assure contingency planning, such as stockpiling
(cid:129) Change market conditions and financial mechanisms to increase resiliency
(cid:129) Encourage collaborations to support energy market development (e.g. joint development of

natural gas pipelines, hydro power, and power transmission lines)
(cid:129) Distribute electricity generation to reduce risk of power disruption
(cid:129) Expand linkages with other regions

(cid:129) Change location and/or management of service provision
(cid:129)
(cid:129) Encourage changes in recreational preferences

Increase use of artificial interventions to stabilize conditions

(cid:129) Change storage and distribution systems in the wholesale and retail trades
(cid:129) Alter consumer goods and services offered in particular locations
(cid:129) Adapt to altered trade patterns by building robust ties with the globalising economy (e.g. ties

could open up a wider range of possible alternatives for adaptation)

(cid:129) Capitalize on long-term trends in consumer behaviour and lifestyle (e.g. expand markets for
cooling equipment, provide facilities and goods for outdoor recreation in temperate climates)

(cid:129) Employ artificial snow-making on ski hills
(cid:129) Groom ski slopes
(cid:129) Move ski areas to higher altitudes and glaciers
(cid:129)

Invest in beach enhancement

(cid:129) Communicate risk information to individual stakeholders (e.g. insurance pricing signals) to help

inform appropriate adaptive behaviours

(cid:129) Reward actions taken to reduce risk (e.g. lower premiums)
(cid:129)
(cid:129)

Integrate insurance with other financial services
Improve tools to transfer risks out of the insurance market into the capital markets through
catastrophe risk securitisations
Improve risk and capital auditing

(cid:129)
(cid:129) Withdraw insurance coverage from locations at greatest risk
