existing facilities in the anticipation of more intense events causing damage.

3.4  natural disaster and related emergency management and response capacity may need to cater to more frequent, simultaneous and extreme disasters as well as  

the associated cascading effects.

develop a policy for facility back-up power and assess departments for gaps  
in back-up power. 
evaluate and learn from HrVA work done by the integrated partnership for 
regional emergency Management in Metro Vancouver. 
Support delivery of a special events risk assessment Advanced planning Unit. 
Consider heat and wind as factors in assessment. 
Broaden ‘team Vancouver emergency response’ volunteer urban search and 
rescue to aid with extreme event response. Wide response functions including 
flooding response, heat alert patrols, park post-storm clean up etc. 
prioritizing several of the highest ranked risks in the HrVA, assess critical infra-
structure and lifelines for resilience. Follow new Zealand lifeline study example.
