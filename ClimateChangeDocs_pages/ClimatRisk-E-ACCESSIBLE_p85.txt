2.2 PROJECTED CHANGES 

The Plan2Adapt tool (Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium, 2013c), developed by the Pacific 
Climate Impacts Consortium, provides generalized climate change projections for British 
Columbia for three time horizons as well as for each of the ecoprovince designations based on 
a standard set of climate model projections (Tables 3 and 4).  Projections are broadly consistent 
with observed climate trends (see Section 2.1). Overall, the climate in British Columbia will shift 
over the next 80 years with upwards of 2.7 °C of annual warming, wetter winters, generally drier 
summers and significantly longer frost-free periods.  

Table 3: Projected changes in selected climate variables for the province of British Columbia for three 
time periods – the 2020s, 2050s and 2080s. Projected changes are relative to the historic baseline 
1961-1990. The ensemble median is a mid-point value, chosen from a set of 15 Global Climate Model 
(GCM) projections for each of A2 and B1. (Source: Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium, 2013c)
