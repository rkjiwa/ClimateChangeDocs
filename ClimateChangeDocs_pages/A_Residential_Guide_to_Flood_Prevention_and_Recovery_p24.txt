Surface cleaning
• Clean all surfaces and belongings. Wipe or scrub away dirt  
and debris using a solution of unscented detergent and water.

• Disinfect all surfaces and belongings. Be sure they have 

already been thoroughly cleaned. Use a disinfectant such as 
household bleach and carefully follow the directions for use 
on the product label. Be sure to wear appropriate personal 
protective equipment and ventilate the area. 

What to do with household items 
Items that have been contaminated by sewage or that have  
been wet for a long time and cannot be washed and disinfected 
should be discarded. Refer to page 23 for information on flood 
waste disposal.
Carpets and upholstered furniture that can be salvaged may 
need to be professionally cleaned and dried. If these items are 
sewage-soaked, they should be discarded. 
Wet drywall and insulation should be removed to allow  
studding to dry. 
Washable clothes can be salvaged.
Salvage books, photographs and papers by slow, careful drying.

Appliances 
• A qualified service technician should verify the safety  

of any appliance that has been affected by flood water  
before it is used. 

• Thoroughly clean and disinfect appliances that can be salvaged. 
• Appliances that cannot be salvaged should be discarded.

Medicines, cosmetics and other toiletries 
Discard these items if they have been in contact with flood water.  
Visit peelregion.ca/waste for proper disposal.
Documentation 
• Store all valuable papers that have been damaged in a freezer 
until they are needed. After your clean-up, consult your lawyer 
to determine whether flood-damaged documents, or just the 
information in them, must be retained. 

• Record details of flood damage by photograph or video  

if possible. 

• Register the amount of damage to your home with your 

insurance agent.
