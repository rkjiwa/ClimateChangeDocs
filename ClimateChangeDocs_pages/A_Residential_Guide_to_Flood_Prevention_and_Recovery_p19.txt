Reducing the Risk  
of Flood Damage
If heavy rains are forecasted for your area and 
the potential for flooding exists, the following 
actions can help reduce property damage to 
your home:
• Clear drains, gutters and downspouts of  

dead leaves and other debris.

• Move furniture, electronics and items of 
sentimental value out of basements and 
lower levels of the home or raise them off  
the floor.

• To reduce the chances of rugs getting wet, 
roll them up and if possible, store them on 
higher floors.

• Ensure sump pumps and backwater valves 
are working properly. If a sump pump has a 
battery backup, ensure the batteries are fresh 
and replace the batteries as required.

• Make sure basement windows are closed. 
• Ensure that generators, hoses and portable 

pumps are maintained and accessible should 
they be required. 

• Always operate gas powered equipment in  

a well ventilated outdoor area.

Potential hazards in  
flooding conditions
Flooding conditions can create hazardous 
situations both in and around your home.  
Here are some potential hazards to be  
aware of:
• Standing water may be electrically  

charged by indoor electrical systems  
and underground or downed power lines.  
Keep yourself, children and pets away from 
standing water and downed power lines. 

• Floodwaters can move quickly and pose a 
risk of drowning. Protect your safety and  
do not drive or walk through floodwaters.

• Building structures can be affected and 

become unsafe. Leave your home if there 
are any signs of potential foundation and 
structural damage, including to porch roofs 
and overhangs. 

• Floodwaters often erode roads and 

walkways. Roads may have weakened and 
could collapse under the weight of a car.  
Do not travel in flood impacted areas.

• Flood waters can contain sewage (may 
contain bacteria, viruses or parasites), 
chemicals and debris like broken glass. 
Keep yourself, family and pets away from 
flood waters. Do not enter a flood area 
unless wearing appropriate personal 
protective equipment and clothing.
