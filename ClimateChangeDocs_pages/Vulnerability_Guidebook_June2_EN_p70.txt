Chapter 5  Completion Check-in

Has the assessment team:  

 

 

 

 

 Developed a list of possible adaptation options for each of the CCFM SFM criteria 
and for the overall SFM system of interest or, if you are reassessing adaptation 
options, a list of modified options? 
 Conducted an assessment of the importance of adaptation options for achieving 
SFM objectives and for the overall SFM system of interest under the range of 
climate change scenarios that you have defined?
