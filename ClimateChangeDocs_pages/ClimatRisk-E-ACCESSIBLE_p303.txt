climate data. Research suggests municipalities can optimize their winter road maintenance 
operations and save money with the assistance of real-time information (Fu et al., 2009). An 
example is the use of Roadway Information Systems in some Canadian cities, which provide real-
time road condition and usage information for municipalities (Clean Air Partnership, 2012).

Ice-reduction practices. Research suggests that “anti-icing, pre-wet salting with plowing and 
sanding all reduce accident occurrence” (Andrey et al., 2013) during icy road conditions. To 
avoid or resolve environmental issues related to increased salt use for icy roads, municipalities in 
Ontario have employed alternative, lower-impact melt solutions (i.e. beet juice, cheese brine) 
(Clean Air Partnership, 2012).

SOCIAL ADAPTATIONS

These adaptations include strategies designed to leverage social networks to increase awareness and 
response time during extreme events. For instance, many municipalities now use social media to help 
communicate travel advisories and alerts for road and active transportation infrastructure conditions 
(e.g., flooding) and public transit service delays during extreme weather events (Mims, 2010; White et 
al., 2009). Table 2 provides an overview of adaptation practices identified in this chapter. 

The section to follow presents five case studies describing specific transportation adaptation 
approaches in Canadian cities, including discussion of where and how adaptations have been 
applied, benefits, costs, tradeoffs, and lessons-learned.
