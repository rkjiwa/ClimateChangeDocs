 
Eliminate gravity drains below the 
anticipated flood level. 

 
1. Prevents sewage from backing up 
when flooding occurs. 
 
2. Potentially useful if flow prevention 
valves on sewer lines are not 
feasible. 

 
1. A pump and generator are 
required. 
 
2. May not be technically feasible or 
permitted especially for hook-ups to 
municipal sewers.

Install  a  waterproof  well  casing  to 
prevent  surface  water  from  entering 
the  well.  Protect  the  well  top  from 
scour and impact damage. 
 
If  possible,  ensure  that  the  septic 
system 
the 
anticipated  flood  elevation.  If  this  is 
not  possible,  Install  a  watertight  cap 
(e.g. bolted with neoprene gasket) to 
keep surface water out of the septic 
tank  and  install  a  valve  to  prevent 
sewage backflow during a flood.  
 
Fuel Supply 
 
Install  shutoff  valves,  waterproof  fill 
caps,  and  make  sure  tank  vents 
extend  above  the  anticipated  flood 
level.  If  evacuation  is  necessary, 
close  fuel  valves  before  leaving  the 
site. 
 
If  oil  and  propane  storage  tanks 
cannot  be  located  above  the  flood 
elevation, brace and anchor them to 
prevent  flotation,  separation  of  fuel 
lines/pipes,  and  damage  to  tanks 
and fuel lines (due to scour, erosion, 
and impact from floating debris). 
 

1. Helps prevent contamination of 
water supply by bacteria and other 
pollutants during a flood.  

 

 
1. May prevent sewage backflow 
from entering to building.  

 
 
1. Reduces risk of fire and explosion. 
 
2. Prevents building damage and 
pollution due to fuel leaks. 
 
3. Adaptable to most buildings.

1. Sewage system may be 
inoperable during the flood. 
 
2. Buoyancy forces on underground 
septic tanks located below the flood 
elevation may lead to damage and 
failure of the septic system.  

 
 
1. Minor post-flood maintenance may 
be required.
