Climate Change Adaptation Plan  2012 

 
Medium– Low Risk Impacts 
Though the focus of this plan is to minimize medium high - extreme risk impacts, it is important to be 
aware of the other potential impacts discussed during internal consultations. Various adaptation 
measures may provide resiliency for more than one potential impact. Though the majority of the 
potential impacts discussed are negative (table 4), it is important to consider the possible advantages 
that may occur under a changing climate (table 5).

Potential Impacts 

  Increased opportunity for invasive species 
  More opportunity for vector borne diseases (West Nile, Lyme disease) 
  Increased demand for active transportation options 
  Increase in freeze/thaw cycles damaging roads, increasing winter control 
  Reduced ability to maintain outdoor ice rinks 
  A shift in physical activities to indoor venues 
  Decrease in air quality/increase in the number of smog days 
  Increased demand for electricity 
  Increase risk of brown/blackouts due to the demand for electricity 
  More rapid deterioration of infrastructure  
  More premature equipment failure 
  Increase chance of food-borne illnesses 
  Increase in plant growth 
  Increase risk of flooding to basements, roads and other infrastructure 
  Increased risk of erosion of stream banks, drains 
  Increase costs for storm water management 
  Increase risk of ice damage to urban forest 
  Increase in winter control costs 
  Increased risk of winter flooding/ice jam related flooding 
  More stress/failures among tree plantings 
  Increased need for irrigation 
  Decrease in aquatic habitat 
  Increase risk of flooding (basement, road, stream) 
  Increase flooding of sport fields requiring closure 
  Damage to existing tree cover 
  Increase demand for emergency services to respond to extreme events 
  Increase in combined sewer overflows or waste water  bypasses 
  Increased opportunities for invasive aquatic species 
  Decrease in surface water quality (more algae, e-coli) 
  Increase in shoreline erosion 
  Possible loss of access to marinas 
  Increased erosion 
  Undermining of shoreline protection structures, exposure of outlets
