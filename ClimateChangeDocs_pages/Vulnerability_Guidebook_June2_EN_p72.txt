From the assessment 
framework…
“Mainstreaming adaptation into 
decision making is a continual 
process whereby 

  •   adaptations are assessed in 
terms of the degree to which 
they are effective; 

  •   technical feasibility and costs 

and benefits are evaluated; 

  •   adaptations that are feasible 
and economically justified are 
implemented; 

  •   the performance of the 

adaptations is monitored and 
evaluated; 

  •   the adaptation program and/
or management objectives are 
modified, if necessary; and 

  •   vulnerability is periodically 

reassessed as new knowledge, 
learning, and insights become 
known.”

—Williamson et al. (2012)

6.1  Overview

This chapter provides guidance on implementing and mainstreaming adaptation for SFM. 
It is structured around four worksheets that are designed to facilitate mainstreaming of 
adaptation into SFM planning and practice:

Worksheet 6.1.  Prioritize adaptation options

Worksheet 6.2.  Recommend priority adaptation options for implementation

Worksheet 6.3.  Implement (mainstream) recommended adaptations

Worksheet 6.4.  Evaluate adaptation performance

Purpose of “implementing and 
mainstreaming adaptation”

To support efficient and successful 
implementation of adaptation priorities 
by mainstreaming selected adaptation 
options into existing SFM activities as 
much as possible

Outcomes

•   A list of prioritized adaptation options

•   A list of recommended adaptation 

options for implementation

•   Integration of implementation planning 
into existing SFM processes or creation 
of an implementation plan outlining 
the human resources, financial 
resources, business processes, and 
partnerships required for successful 
implementation of your adaptation 
priorities

•   A plan for continuous evaluation of the 
implementation of adaptation actions 
and for continuous monitoring of the 
SFM system 

6.2  Prioritize and Recommend Adaptation Options

6.2.1     The Theory
After “important” adaptation options have been identified, they can be prioritized 
and then rejected, postponed, or selected for implementation. Of the many methods 
available for prioritizing options, the most useful will depend on the decision-making 
context of your SFM system and the actors involved in the vulnerability assessment. One 
method for prioritizing adaptation options is a Policy Delphi process (as described in 
“Case study – Lake Simcoe” in section 6.2.2), which involves the use of multiple rounds of 
expert opinion, solicited through an anonymous process, to generate and refine the list 
of potential adaptation options. Conversely, some prioritization may have already been 
completed when you assessed the importance of each adaptation option in Worksheet 
5.1 (Develop potential adaptation options for SFM objectives) and Worksheet 5.2 
(Develop potential adaptation options for the overall SFM system of interest).
