 -  Climate change; soil management; long term tree health as priority in  

development review/public realm planning; organizational changes that  
will facilitate improved integration of trees into urban design; plant/tree  
hardiness; and prevention and management techniques for invasive  
species and pests

Map canopy cover and identify tree deficit and greenspace deficit areas.  
initiate a program to address these areas through development and planning. 
ensure species and location selection criteria for the planting Strategies  
developed under the gCAp consider the best available climate projections  
and any information or mapping related to Urban Heat island effect. 

re-evaluate zero based budget for street and park tree maintenance in urban 
forest management plan.
review replacement tree list in protection of tree Bylaw and the Water Wise 
Landscape guidelines plant list to ensure all species are resilient to climate 
projections. 
Apply wind management techniques used in Stanley park in other locations 
such as Jericho park and the renfrew ravine. 
record failures in street tree inventory comments section and learn from  
climate related trends.

explore and evaluate options for the storage and reuse of winter rainwater for 
summer irrigation. Use Van dusen gardens as pilot/education opportunity. 
increase artificial turf use
