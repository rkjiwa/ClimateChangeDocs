1.1-C.      Purpose and outcome statements for the vulnerability 

assessment

For this part of the worksheet, consider the following questions: Why are you doing a 
vulnerability assessment? What are the desired or expected outcomes of completing a 
vulnerability assessment for the SFM system of interest? How will the results be used? 
Refer back to these purpose and outcome statements when defining the scale and scope 
of the assessment. Ensure that the scale is appropriate and the scope sufficient to achieve 
the intended and expected outcomes. Defining these aspects early in the assessment 
process will help you to focus the scope and participation level.
