in a wider sense is the state, including a statistical description, of the climate system. The 
classical period of time is 30 years, as defined by the World Meteorological Organization 
(WMO)” (Parry et al. 2007).

Climate change
“Climate change refers to any change in climate over time, whether due to natural 
variability or as a result of human activity. This usage differs from that in the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which defines ‘climate change’ as: 
‘a change of climate which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters 
the composition of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate 
variability observed over comparable time periods’” (Parry et al. 2007).

Climate change impacts
“The effects of climate change on natural and human systems. Depending on the 
consideration of adaptation, one can distinguish between potential impacts and residual 
impacts.” Potential impacts are “all impacts that may occur given a projected change in 
climate, without considering adaptation.” Residual impacts are “the impacts of climate 
change that would occur after adaptation” (Parry et al. 2007). In vulnerability assessment, 
impacts are the result of exposure to climate change and the sensitivity of the sustainable 
forest management system to a particular level of exposure.

Climate variability
“Variations in the mean state and other statistics (such as standard deviations, the 
occurrence of extremes, etc.) of the climate on all temporal and spatial scales beyond 
that of individual weather events. The term is often used to denote deviations of climatic 
statistics over a given period of time (e.g. a month, season or year) from the long-term 
statistics relating to the corresponding calendar period. In this sense, climate variability is 
measured by those deviations, which are usually termed anomalies. Variability may be due 
to natural internal processes within the climate system (internal variability), or to variations 
in natural or anthropogenic external forcing (external variability)” (WMO n.d.).

Driver
Any natural or human-induced factor that directly or indirectly causes a change in a 
system, such as an ecosystem, managed forest, or human community (MEA 2005). 
Examples include changes in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases driving 
changes in planetary mean temperature or changes in societal values driving changes in 
forest use.

Ecosystem
“The interactive system formed from all living organisms and their abiotic (physical and 
chemical) environment within a given area. Ecosystems cover a hierarchy of spatial 
scales and can comprise the entire globe, biomes at the continental scale or small, well-
circumscribed systems such as a small pond” (Parry et al. 2007).
