It is important to note that all criteria presented in Figure 16 can be equally important in influencing the 
classification outcome. Thus, it is possible that evaluating the impacts of climate change (which is an example 
of evaluating the purpose of the information) on a given species is not automatically part of the intermediate 
needs category, as it will also depend, for example, on the climate variables needed. By the same token, 
evaluating adaptation options is not, de facto, part of the detailed category. 

In addition, the categories are presented here as well-defined entities but in fact they represent a gradient 
of increasing complexity in the climate data requested and/or produced. Examples of answers to each of the 
questions and how they can be associated with one category are presented in Table 4. 

Table 4 |  Overview of three climate information categories, basic, intermediate, and detailed. 

CATEGORY

BASIC

EXAMPLE  
OF PURPOSE
To raise awareness:
-initial awareness
-risk scanning
-high level governance

EXAMPLE OF 
 CLIMATE INDEX

Annual temperature
Annual precipitation

EXAMPLE OF  

SPATIAL RESOLUTION
Coarse scale 
(e.g. the globe)

EXAMPLE OF 

CLIMATE STATISTIC
Mean (delta) 
change 

INTERMEDIATE

DETAILED

To evaluate vulnerability/
impact study:
-vulnerability assessment
-impact study
-increase resilience
-early development of 
adaptation plan
To evaluate adaptation 
options:
-evaluate adaptation 
measures
-research and development
-local governance

Growing degree-

Heating degree-days 
Freeze-thaw cycles 

Variable 
(e.g. a country, 
province, watershed)

Future values

Wind

Typically finer scale 
(e.g. a municipality)

Extremes

Increasing

in the type 
of climate

temporal 
resolution, 
increase 
in the 

uncertainties

information, 
increase in

Note that the goal is not necessarily to ‘advance’ from one category to the next but simply to choose the 
most appropriate category for a given purpose. For some users, there will be a progression in the type of 
information they require based on their current knowledge and on the types of decisions they have to make 
over time. However, for others, basic climate information will suffice to inform fairly complex decisions. 

To  further  help  users  visualize  and  evaluate  their  own  climate  information  needs,  the  criteria  described 
above have been used to develop a decision-tree (Figure 17) that is in essence a roadmap to producing cli-
mate information. By answering the roadmap questions, users are guided to one of three broad categories 
of climate information: basic, intermediate, and detailed.
