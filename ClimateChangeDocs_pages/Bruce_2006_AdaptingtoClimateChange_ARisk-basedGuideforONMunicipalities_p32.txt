 

Recreation: 
Winter snow-based recreation in southwest 
Ontario will have shorter seasons in future, 
due to less ice on the lakes.  A longer summer 
recreation season is expected. 
Winter storms and disasters: 
More intense winter snow and ice storms in the 
Northern Hemisphere are projected by climate 
models (Lambert 1995) and evidence of trends 
in this direction have been documented 

 

although snow amounts could increase at ski 
resorts to the east of Lake Huron and Georgian 
Bay with a longer period of lake-effect storms 
(McCabe et al. 2001). Public Safety and 
Emergency Preparedness Canada has 
documented an approximate 7-fold increase in 
numbers of climate/weather related disasters 
between the 1960s and the 1990s, while the 
number of geophysical disasters remained 
steady.
