Are my sewer laterals working properly? 

D
Sewer laterals, the pipes that connect a homeâ€™s plumbing system to
the municipal underground sewer system, should be regularly
maintained. Over time, the sanitary sewer lateral can get clogged with
fats, oils and grease (FOGS) or other debris, which can restrict "ows
and cause sewer backup. This may especially be a problem in older
homes when the lateral has not been routinely maintained. Sewer
laterals are accessed through the cleanout port, which may be located
either inside of the basement or outside of the home, close to where
the lateral enters the home. 

To !nd out how well your sanitary sewer lateral has been maintained,
you should talk to a licensed plumber who can carry out a camera
inspection of your lateral. A plumbing inspection will identify if it is
contributing to your "ood risk. Some communities recommend that
homeowners replace their sewer lateral every 30 years or so.

Basement windows

E
If your basement windows are
close to the surface of the
ground, window wells and
window well covers can reduce
the crevasses that allow water
to enter. The outer edges
of the window well should !t
snugly against the wall. The
bottom of the well should be
15 cm below the underside 
of the window with a mixture 
of gravel and sand to allow
drainage.
