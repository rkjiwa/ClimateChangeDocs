emergency planning

(For additional resources see: Emergency Management in BC: Reference Manual, Emergency Man-
agement BC, 06/08/2011. Note that not all emergencies are eligible for emergency funding.)

 F Has the Emergency Response Plan and related planning and policies been reviewed and 

updated to take into account projected changes in climate?

 F Will effective emergency planning require consultation with other local governments 
in the region, other government agencies and authorities? (e.g. port authorities, public 
transportation authorities, utility companies, railway companies, RCMP, Coast Guard, 
Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure, meteorological services, etc.)

 F Are there opportunities to partner with neighbouring communities and First Nations with 

respect to emergency planning and response?

 F Will the central business area and commercial and industrial activities that the community 

relies on be able to continue functioning during a climate-related emergency?

 F Where are hazardous materials located in the community?

 F Where are the vulnerable populations (i.e. seniors, homeless, street workers, low income 

areas)? Are they able to evacuate easily? Is there dependence on public transit?

 F Are there specific land uses that may need additional attention in a climate-related 

emergency (i.e. hospital, care facilities, seniors homes, group homes, transition houses, 
shelters, schools, pharmacies, emergency gathering centers)?

 F Are there special communications considerations in resorts or major tourist areas where 

visitors’ primary language may not be English?

 F Where are the contamination risks (sewage lagoon, landfill, groundwater, commercial or 

industrial uses)? What mitigation is needed?

 F What would happen if farm animals needed to be moved? Is there a plan to deal with dead 

or injured livestock?

 F Do local emergency response teams have the capacity to deal with multiple disasters 

occurring at the same time, e.g. an extreme precipitation event and a severe windstorm? 
Note that some areas are also subject to earthquakes and tsunamis.)
