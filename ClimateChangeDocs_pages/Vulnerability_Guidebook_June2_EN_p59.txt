affecting forest management seems to be rising (see Case Study – “National assessment 
of adaptive capacity and sustainable forest management”). The combined effect is 
increasing recognition of the need to be adaptive and to understand and develop the 
system’s inherent capacity to adapt. Adaptive capacity can be assessed a number of 
ways. Williamson and Isaac (2013) summarized the current literature on adaptive capacity 
relevant to SFM and presented a framework of the dimensions of adaptive capacity along 
with relevant assessment approaches.

assessment of adaptive 
capacity and sustainable 
forest management

Based largely on insights from extensive discussions and interviews with Canadian forest 
managers and other practitioners, Johnston et al. (2010) reported the following key 
findings:

    • 

 Awareness of the issue and perception of urgency – Awareness of climate change 
as an important issue for forest management is increasing in Canada, although site-
specific impacts and adaptation options are not yet well understood. 

    •   Range of technological options available to decision makers – The availability of 

technological options for adaptation is variable, and cost is often a limiting factor. 

    •   Economic resources – Investment in innovation in the Canadian forest sector is 
generally low, which limits the ability to develop innovative solutions to address 
climate change impacts. In addition, resources are often lacking to support 
vulnerability assessments and adaptation planning. 

    •   Institutional factors (e.g., design and structure, flexibility, ability to efficiently 

allocate resources to adaptation, degree of autonomy in making adaptation choices) 
– Institutional barriers are an important limitation to implementing adaptation 
options. Analyses of current policy could help in identifying features likely to hinder 
adaptation. Canadian forest management has a number of institutions that increase 
adaptive capacity (e.g., Forest Products Association of Canada, the model forest 
network, forest certification programs, the national forest strategy, and professional 
associations).

    •   Human and social capital of adaptors (e.g., skills, education, experience, networks) 
– Although the adaptive capacity of the forestry profession is generally high, a lack of 
scientific capacity is an important constraint to planning for climate change. In some 
locations, the lack of human capacity is seen as a constraint.

    •   Knowledge and access to information – Research capacity related to forest 

management is high in Canada, but to date researchers have not addressed climate 
change comprehensively. Also, there is a lack of scientific capacity relative to 
understanding and dealing with climate change in the Canadian forest sector, and 
a lack of information at spatial and temporal scales relevant to forest management 
planning and decision making. New modeling tools will assist in developing a 
better understanding of the impacts of climate change and the role of potential 
management interventions in adaptation activities.

    •   Ability to manage risk – Forestry companies, like any other type of business, engage 

in risk management as part of normal business practice. However, some aspects of 
forest management, such as long-term commitments favoring certain tree species 
during reforestation, make risk management more difficult.
