5.0  general ChangeS

Significant impacts
5.1 new and existing Buildings may be maladapted as the climate changes in terms of water ingress, wind, durability, rain on snow loads, increasing heat waves etc. 

5.2 Decrease in durability and lifecycle of infrastructure leading to increased maintenance and replacement requirements.

5.3 increase in impacts to urban forests, green spaces and trees from temperature extremes and wind storms resulting in increased maintenance and replacement costs

5.4. increasing vectors for disease and respiratory illness are expected health impacts from increasing temperatures 

5.1 new and existing Buildings may be maladapted as the climate changes in terms of water ingress, wind, durability, rain on snow loads, increasing heat waves etc.

cooling degree days; development in the fire interface areas; appropriate 
weather protection guidelines; roof drainage; gray water and rainwater  
capture for toilets/garden use.

issue a bulletin on construction safety with changes in storms and wind  
increases. include a sentence in building bylaw for construction on  
considering climate change in construction safety plan.
Continue to lobby homeowner protection office for broad acceptance of  
green roofs.
emergency management plans â€“ evacuation plans for buildings including  
seismic and flooding.

5.2 Decrease in durability and lifecycle of infrastructure leading to increased maintenance and replacement requirements.
aCtion
Work with partners from other levels of government, and with USdn Cascadia 
to investigate and apply methods of incorporating climate change considerations 
into infrastructure lifecycle planning and maintenance monitoring. include how 
to track, record and evaluate impacts on infrastructure. 
develop a policy for regularly updating best practices to reflect new climate 
change projections in infrastructure design and repair. 
Low lying pump stations may require increased maintenance
Apply the pieVC protocol for infrastructure vulnerability where screening level 
risk assessment indicates high risk. 
Support forensic studies to determine climate thresholds.
