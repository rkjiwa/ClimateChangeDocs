How should the assessment be completed? The goal of this step is to assess the 
adaptive capacity or adaptability of the SFM organization or system, not to evaluate 
specific adaptations. Nonetheless, it may be helpful to think of adaptive capacity in 
terms of what would be needed to implement potential adaptations. For example, 
implementing a potential adaptation may require research, budget reallocation, increased 
funding, knowledge exchange, education, more knowledgeable staff, stronger networks, 
or changes in rules and policies. The question of adaptability pertains to the degree to 
which the resources that enable adaptation are available, the degree to which institutions 
are designed to permit adaptation where it is justified, and the flexibility of governance to 
allow for changes in institutions where they are needed and justified.  

Tables 4.2.1 â€“ 4.2.6 present a series of questions to guide you through an assessment of 
the adaptive capacity of your SFM system of interest. Many of the questions ask you to 
rank your response (e.g., high, medium, or low) and significant space is provided to record 
details of why a certain rank was chosen. It is likely members of the assessment team may 
have differing opinions on certain questions. It would be useful to record any discussions 
had on each question or difference of opinions presented within the assessment team.     

4.2.1      Awareness and understanding of climate change and 

perceptions of risk related to climate change

Awareness and understanding of the potential effects of climate change and perceptions 
of risk by political leaders, senior policy makers, forest management practitioners, SFM 
stakeholders, and the general public will significantly influence preparedness and 
willingness to implement adaptation measures at various levels. Stakeholders includes 
those with a direct stake in forest resource management, including the forest industry, 
First Nations, nongovernmental organizations, other governments, grazing lease holders, 
trappers, outdoor recreation users, outfitters, professional foresters organizations, forest-
based communities.
