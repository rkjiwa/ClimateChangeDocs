RAIL TRANSPORT 

Similar to road transportation, the safety, efficiency, and reliability of rail transportation can be 
compromised by the climate impacts illustrated in Figure 3. Extreme precipitation and coastal storm 
surges can cause washouts, while both permafrost degradation and temperature extremes can 
necessitate slower train speeds and potentially cause derailments. At the same time, warming winter 
temperatures, which are projected throughout Canada, may reduce track and mechanical issues 
caused by extreme cold.

EXAMPLES OF IMPACTS ON RAIL 

TRANSPORT

① Flooding, wash-outs, and obstructions of 
railway tracks and embankments, bridges, and 
culverts, flooding of below-grade tunnels

② Rail bridge scour and damage to bridge 

structures from ice jams

③ Buckling of rail tracks 

CLIMATE FACTOR(S)

 • Extreme precipitation (heavy rainfall) and 

associated standing water, landslides, mudslides, 
rock slides, debris floods, ice-jam flooding
 • Storm surges/sea level rise in coastal areas
 • Extreme precipitation (heavy rainfall, flood-

induced erosion)

 • Permafrost thaw 
 • Extreme heat or large temperature fluctuations

④ Broken rail tracks and equipment malfunctions 

and failures (may include broken wheels, 
reduced effectiveness of brakes, frozen switches)

⑤ Damage to signalization equipment, rail line 

obstruction (i.e. fallen power lines/trees), 
railcar blow-over

 • Extreme cold

 • High winds
 • Extreme precipitation 
 • Freezing rain
