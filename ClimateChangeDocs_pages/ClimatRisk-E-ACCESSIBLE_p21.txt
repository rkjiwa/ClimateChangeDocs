• 

Implementing heaters and cooling fans to improve 
tolerance of traffic signal controllers to extreme 
temperatures, and thermosyphons to maintain 
permafrost stability at airports;

•  Changing infrastructure design requirements to include 

climate change considerations or to introduce new flood 
event thresholds; 

•  Elevating or relocating new infrastructure where feasible; 

•  Changing engineering procedures, such as increasing 

temperature thresholds for rail track to reduce risk of 
buckling during large temperature differentials;

• 

• 

Increasing monitoring of weather events and 
infrastructure conditions;  

Implementing or enhancing travel advisories and alerts 
to communicate travel conditions and service delays 
during weather events.

There are two categories of response 
to climate change – mitigation and 
adaptation. 

Mitigation refers to human 
interventions to reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions.  

Adaptation refers to any activity 
that reduces the negative impacts 
of climate change and/or takes 
advantage of new opportunities. 
This includes actions taken before 
impacts are observed (anticipatory), 
and after impacts have been felt 
(reactive). Adaptation can be 
planned (i.e., the result of deliberate 
policy decisions), or spontaneous, 
in the case of reactive adaptation 
(Warren and Lemmen, 2014).
