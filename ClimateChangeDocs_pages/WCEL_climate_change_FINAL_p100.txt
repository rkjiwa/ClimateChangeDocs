Asset management

(For additional resources see: Asset Management BC www.assetmanagementbc.ca/)

 F Have local government assets and property been assessed for vulnerability to climate 

impacts anticipated during their lifetime?

 F Have the assets and property found to be vulnerable been assessed and ranked in terms 

of how critical their functions are (e.g. a bridge that also carries water, sewer, gas lines 
and communication lines will likely be more critical than a bridge that only serves road 
transportation needs)?

 F Has appropriate action been taken in terms of policy and investment to reduce 

vulnerability of critical assets?

 F When taking into account the impacts of climate change over the longer term, have 
life cycle costing methods been used to understand the real costs of improvements 
or alterations required to infrastructure (i.e. including not only capital investment, but 
operation and maintenance costs)? Have the life-cycle costs associated with green 
infrastructure solutions or low-impact development been compared?

 F Have changed levels of service because of climate change impacts been incorporated into 

planning and communicated to the public?

 F Does the community have a formal asset management program and can future 

replacement programs be used to adapt to climate change?

financial plan, strategic plan and budget

 F Has the five-year financial plan been reviewed and revised in light of short to medium term

 F Does the five-year financial plan include costs associated with implementing adaptation 

actions to reduce vulnerability to climate change?

 F Have possible effects of climate change impacts on the tax base been considered?

 F Have the longer term financial implications of climate change been explored in the context 

of maintaining service levels and community quality of life into the future?
