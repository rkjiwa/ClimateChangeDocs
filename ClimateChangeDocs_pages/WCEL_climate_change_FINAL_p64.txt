Local governments have important responsibilities related to infrastructure within their 
communities, including water supply and treatment, transmission and delivery, storm-
water and liquid waste management, watershed protection, solid waste management, 
roads and other transportation infrastructure, and energy infrastructure.

Why look at infrastructure as part of climate change adaptation:

•	

Existing infrastructure, even if well-designed to take into account historically 
relevant environmental factors, may be vulnerable to future climate impacts.

•	

•	

For example, a study of the Vancouver Sewerage Area System 
identified vulnerabilities related to storm surges and sea level rise at 
the wastewater treatment plant, and the possible need to accelerate 
ongoing work to separate combined sewers and to address increased 
precipitation over time. www.metrovancouver.org/planning/

Engineers Canada is developing the PIEVC (Public Infrastructure 
Engineering Vulnerability Committee) protocol aimed at obtaining a 
more detailed technical vulnerability analysis for infrastructure:  
www.pievc.ca

•	

Climate change impacts can create potential catastrophic risks to infrastructure 
that arise from inadequate design and vulnerable location — losses associated, 
for example, with flooding, violent winds, temperature extremes and sea level 
rise.

•	

In Kimberley municipal infrastructure including local chlorination plants 
was found to be vulnerable to wildfire. www.cbt.org/uploads/pdf/
