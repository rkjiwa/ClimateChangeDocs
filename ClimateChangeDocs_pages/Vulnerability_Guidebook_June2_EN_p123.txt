4.2.6     Resource governance dynamics and institutional change 
Resource governance can be defined as the manner in which rules about resource 
management are established, implemented, and modified as deemed necessary and 
appropriate. Given the preponderance of provincially owned forest land in Canada, 
forest resource governance is largely the responsibility of provincial forest management 
agencies. Resource governance regimes in Canada are continuously evolving and 
adapting to new ecological, economic, cultural and social conditions. Modifying 
institutions in response to change is not a novel concept. However, climate change 
offers a new and somewhat unprecedented driver of change. It is not something that 
resource governance regimes have necessarily experienced in the past or for which 
they have precedents. The relative capacity of resource governance systems to make 
necessary changes to institutions to properly adapt to climate change, and the ease with 
which they do so, will vary from situation to situation. Thus, this section of the adaptive 
capacity assessment considers the ability of resource governance regimes to adapt their 
institutions in anticipation of climate change, considering both the mechanisms and the 
challenges of adapting institutions. A self-assessment approach is proposed.
