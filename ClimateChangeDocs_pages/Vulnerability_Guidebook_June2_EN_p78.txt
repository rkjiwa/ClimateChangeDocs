To be effective, monitoring should be part of a systematic process in which information 
gained by monitoring is used to improve decisions, refine practices, or change 
management objectives (e.g., adaptive management or continuous improvement). 
The monitoring results can help to identify areas where implementation is progressing 
and objectives are being met but also areas of concern. For each measure that raises 
a concern, adjustments to current practices (e.g., changes to operational practices, 
refinements to plans, enhanced research) should be identified and implemented. If SFM 
is not being satisfactorily achieved, the manager, agency, or organization responsible 
for forest management should determine a new course of action, such as modifying 
the adaptation, modifying relevant SFM objectives, or acknowledging (and ideally 
documenting) that the residual vulnerability to SFM is acceptable and that no further 
changes to current activities are needed (see the decision-analysis framework for 
adaptation to climate change, presented as Figure 4 in Williamson et al. [2012]). 

All interested parties involved in or affected by the management and adaptation activities 
being evaluated should be included in, or at least informed about, the monitoring and 
evaluation of SFM and implementation of adaptations.

In an adaptive management context, there is a number of reasons for establishing 
a monitoring or tracking program, in addition to monitoring the performance of 
adaptations:

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

•   to determine whether the context of your management objectives and vulnerabilities 

has changed 

•   to assess if any of the underlying research is out of date

•   to track implementation progress

•   to communicate accomplishments through regular reporting

•   to support adaptive management

•   to highlight areas requiring management attention

•   to indicate where changes or revisions may be required to the adaptation plan.

6.4.2     The Practice
Where adaptations are mainstreamed into existing planning and practices, such as SFM 
plans, existing monitoring approaches should be reviewed to ensure they account for 
the adaptations. Additional monitoring should be considered to adequately track the 
success of adaptations and catch any concerns early in the adaptation process. As well, 
it may be necessary to refine existing indicators to integrate the new information from 
this process. A recent report by Steenberg et al. (2013) provides guidance on adjusting 
CCFM SFM indicators to reflect climate change adaptation (see “Case Study – Review of 
SFM indicators for climate change”). Williamson and Edwards (2014) have suggested that a 
national conversation may be required to address the potential impacts of climate change 
on the national CCFM criteria and indicators.

If existing planning and practices do not include monitoring and evaluation, the 
implementation of climate change adaptations may create an opportunity to integrate 
these important management phases into the organization’s day-to-day operations,
