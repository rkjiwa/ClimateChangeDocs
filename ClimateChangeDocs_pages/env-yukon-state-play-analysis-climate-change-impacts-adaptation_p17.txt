Yukon ‘State of Play’:  
Analysis of Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation 
 
These observations indicate how changes in climate are changing local ecology and landscapes 
across Yukon. This has far reaching consequences for wildlife and vegetation that are still not 
fully understood. While we know that some birds and shrub are changing in response to shifting 
temperatures, plant or animal species that cannot adapt or move to more favourable areas fast 
enough may experience stress and other negative impacts.
