Case Study  – “Climate 
Change and Canada’s 
Forests” 

This document, a compilation of contributions from the authors of the forestry sections 
in the Canadian national assessment (Lemmen et al. 2008) states that “Climate change is 
already affecting Canada’s forests.” They list the following recent changes in Canada’s forests 
that are related in some way to recent climate change:

   • 

   • 

   • 

   • 

   • 

   • 

 longer growing seasons, earlier bud burst and flowering in some species, and upward 
expansion of treelines to encroach upon alpine ecosystems

 nationwide drought in 2001–2003, which was unprecedented in terms of its duration, 
geographic extent, and (in some locations) severity and which resulted in aspen 
dieback in some parts of the prairies and devastating fire seasons in British Columbia 
and Yukon

 more frequent occurrence of extreme wildfire seasons, with severe burning conditions 
at times of the year when they have not previously occurred

 epidemic of mountain pine beetle in western Canada, resulting from large areas of 
mature lodgepole pine and an unprecedented number of abnormally warm winters in 
consecutive years

 the largest outbreak of spruce bark beetle ever recorded in Yukon

 epidemic of Dothistroma needle blight in young and mature lodgepole pine in 
northwest British Columbia.

These changes illustrate that impacts are often the result of interacting factors (e.g., 
mountain pine beetle epidemic due to large areas of mature pine and warm winters). As 
well, climate change has the potential to cause multiple, interacting impacts that occur 
simultaneously. For example, changes in the risks of drought, fire, insect and disease 
disturbance, and extreme weather, as well as changes in growth and yield, may all occur at 
the same time. As a result, foresters must be able to recognize, understand, and adapt to the 
cumulative impacts of climate change.

2.5  Key Uncertainties and Knowledge Gaps

2.5.1     The Theory
Climate change is characterized by substantial uncertainty. You will likely encounter a 
number of knowledge gaps and uncertainties (e.g., concerning the relationship between 
forest conditions and climate) while completing the previous worksheets on climate and 
forest conditions. Key knowledge gaps and uncertainties are often a barrier to successful 
adaptation, as they can cause the vulnerability assessment process to stall or stop. The 
point of recording them here is simply to acknowledge their existence. This list will be a 
great starting point to adaptation option planning (chapter 5).
