4.3.3 CONSTRUCTION TECHNIQUES AND TECHNOLOGIES FOR ALL-WEATHER ROADS

Several methods have been developed to preserve permafrost during construction (see Figure 10 
and Case study 2) (Beaulac and Doré, 2006). These methods have different cost implications (Table 
3) and functional objectives (limiting heat intake, extracting heat, and preserving the integrity of 
embankments).

Application and cost depends 
on available material.
Bulky material needs to be 
imported. More effective if 
used in combination with heat 
extraction methods.

High level of maintenance.

High level of maintenance.*

Possible solution if well 
designed to avoid water 
accumulation in the ducts.
More suitable for severe 
localized problems.
Promising technique. Requires 
competent rock and capacity 
to produce specified material 
near construction site.
Bulky materials need to 
be imported. Promising 
technique.
Likely to reduce settlement 
and cracking problems.
More effective if used in 
combination with heat 
extraction methods. Granular 
material needs to be available.
Possible solution if time permits.
Availability of granular 
material.
Labour intensive solution. 
Requires a service centre near 
the site to be protected.
