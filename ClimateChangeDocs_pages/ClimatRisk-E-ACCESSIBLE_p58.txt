Methods to limit heat intake under roads include:
①	 Embankment thickening (e.g., increasing width and flatness) helps maintain permafrost conditions 

in cold or moderately cold regions (although not in relatively warmer northern regions, as the 
active permafrost layer may be too thick). This method reduces heat penetration underneath 
the embankment (IMG-Golder Corporation Environmental Consulting, 2012). The material 
used to supplement the embankment is an important consideration; for example, polystyrene 
demonstrates long-term resistance to moisture and compression on roads and runways (Beaulac 
and Doré, 2006).

②	 Insulation materials (including polystyrene, polyurethane, foamed concrete, and expanded 
polystyrene block) can be used to preserve the structural integrity of roadways and prevent 
permafrost from cooling in the winter (Montufar et al., 2011).

③	 Snow/sun sheds protect embankment slopes from snow insulation, allow cold air to circulate during 
the winter, and eliminate direct solar radiation during the summer (Beaulac and Doré, 2006). Snow 
sheds have performed well in many locations, but require regular maintenance and present risks 
when overloaded with snow.

④	 Reflective surfaces (see also Figure 11), such as painting paved surfaces white, reduce the absorption of 
solar radiation. While proven effective, this method carries a high initial cost and can decrease traction 
on curves, intersections, and in braking zones after periods of rain (Beaulac and Doré, 2006).
