key relationships. Scenarios may be derived from projections, but are often based on 
additional information from other sources, sometimes combined within a ‘narrative 
storyline’” (Parry et al. 2007). Scenarios are not predictions, and they typically do not 
include prediction errors or likelihoods.

Sensitivity
“The degree to which a system is affected, either adversely or beneficially, by climate 
variability or change. The effect may be direct (e.g., a change in crop yield in response to a 
change in the mean, range or variability of temperature) or indirect (e.g., damages caused 
by an increase in the frequency of coastal flooding due to sea-level rise)” (Parry et al. 2007).

Sensitivity assessment
Assessment of the sensitivity or magnitude of a system’s potential response to a particular 
rate and magnitude of change in local climate (including change in mean values and 
changes in variability and extremes). Sensitivity can be reduced or modified by adaptation.

Sustainable forest management (SFM)
 “Management that maintains and enhances the long-term health of forest ecosystems 
for the benefit of all living things while providing environmental, economic, social, and 
cultural opportunities for present and future generations” (CCFM 2008). According to the 
Canadian Council of Forest Ministers, the criteria for defining and monitoring sustainable 
forest management in Canada are biodiversity, ecosystem condition and productivity, soil 
and water, role of the forests in global ecological cycles, economic and social benefits, and 
society’s responsibility.

Sustainable forest management system
A coupled human–environmental system that obtains goods and services from forests 
and works toward the management of forests in a manner consistent with sustainable 
forest management (SFM) principles and objectives. SFM systems vary with spatial, 
operational, and organizational contexts. An SFM system can exist at any scale, including 
provincial forests, community forests, protected areas, industrial lease areas, and small 
private woodlots.

Vulnerability
“The degree to which a system is susceptible to, and unable to cope with, adverse effects 
of climate change, including climate variability and extremes. Vulnerability is a function of 
the character, magnitude, and rate of climate change and variation to which a system is 
exposed, its sensitivity, and its adaptive capacity” (Parry et al. 2007).
