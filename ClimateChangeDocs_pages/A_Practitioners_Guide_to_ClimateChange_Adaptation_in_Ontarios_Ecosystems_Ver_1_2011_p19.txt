 

 

Step 1:  

  Define the study area and identify environmental themes (ie., ecological, social, and economic) and 

Set Context and 

indicators  

Build Team 

  Build the team and engage experts, stakeholders, and partners 

Step 2: 

Assess Current 

Vulnerability 

Step 3:  

Develop and Apply 
Future Scenarios 

Step 4: 

Estimate Future 
Vulnerability and 

Risks 

  Describe the system’s current sensitivity and exposure to climate and non-climatic stresses 
  Describe the degree of adaptive capacity of the system  

  Develop and apply future climate scenarios  
  Consider anticipated non-climatic stresses (e.g., human population growth, land use) 

Identify and describe future impacts 

 
  Determine future vulnerability and categorize uncertainty 
  Describe the likelihood and consequences of vulnerabilities through socio-economic, political, and 

environmental evaluations 

  Determine areas at highest risk  
  Communicate initial findings to key organizations

Step 5: 

Develop Adaptation 

Options 

  Based on the risk analysis, determine potential adaptation options 
  Prioritize  adaptation  options  considering  economic  feasibility,  social  acceptability,  ecological 

suitability, and technical and institutional feasibility (e.g., barriers and opportunities) 

Step 6: 

Implement and 

Mainstream 
Adaptation 

  Determine highest priority adaptation actions for implementation  
  Communicate accomplishments 
  Monitor adaptation actions and vulnerabilities over time  
  Acquire new knowledge, learning, and insights, and modify adaptation actions as required
