Purchasing a home

When buying a home, it is important to know if the property is in a 
flood-prone area. Here are some things to do and questions to ask:

  Contact your local government and ask if flood-hazard mapping is 
available and what the flood construction level (FCL) is for the area.

  Complete a home inspection to see if the home has been subject 

to past flooding. This can include hiring a qualified professional, 
such as a hydraulic or hydrotechnical engineer, to conduct a 
property assessment.

  Speak with neighbours to learn more about the area’s history.
