APPENDIX 5

Vulnerability assessment identifies who and what is exposed
and sensitive to change. A vulnerability assessment starts by
considering the factors that make people or the environment
susceptible to harm, i.e. access to natural and financial
resources; ability to self-protect; support networks and so
on. (Tompkins et al., 2005)

Weather: The state of the atmosphere at a given time and
place with regard to temperature, air pressure, humidity,
wind, cloudiness, and precipitation. The term weather is
used mostly for conditions over short periods of time.
(Environment Canada, 2008) 

Win-Win Options: Adaptation options that minimize
harmful climate impacts and also have other social,
environmental or economic benefits. (European
Environment Agency, 2005) For example, no-till farming
with residue mulching slows soil erosion and pollution
runoff, acting to adapt agriculture operations to extreme
weather while also benefiting aquatic ecosystems,
improving agronomic productivity, contributing to food
security, and reducing demand for fertilization and
irrigation. (Lal et al., 2004)
