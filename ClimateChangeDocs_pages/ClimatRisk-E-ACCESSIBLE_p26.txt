MODE-SPECIFIC IMPACTS

Similar to regional climate risks, Canada’s four major modes of transportation – road, rail, marine, 
and air – share many common risks to their infrastructure and operations. Furthermore, due to the 
integration of transportation modes and their physical proximity to one another, weather impacts that 
adversely affect one mode of transportation tend to have negative impacts on others. An example is 
the history of simultaneous and sequential failure of highways and rail lines in British Columbia, which 
often run in parallel along mountain corridors and rivers.

Each transportation mode also faces unique risks. The sections below depict some of the ways that 
climate and weather can affect road, rail, marine, air, and urban transport systems in Canada, based 
on the findings in this report.  (Note: Drawings are for illustration purposes only and not intended to be 
technically accurate). 

ROAD TRANSPORT

Climate and weather-related impacts on road transportation (Figure 2) can compromise safety 
and efficiency, disrupt operations, and increase maintenance and operational costs. Anticipated 
changes to some climate variables can also provide benefits to road transport. For example, warmer 
winter temperatures can lead to greater fuel efficiency for vehicles, longer construction seasons, and 
reduced winter maintenance requirements.
