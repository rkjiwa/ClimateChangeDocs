2.2 CLIMATE INFORMATION FORMATS

As  stated  above,  climate  information  categories  evaluate  the  general  level  of  information  complexity 
required by users. However, the way in which the information is presented may be equally as important. 
Proper formatting of the information may ensure the data is not only useful but becomes more usable. User 
backgrounds and areas of expertise will play a large role in determining the optimal format. In other words, 
the same climate information can be presented differently depending on expertise or preference. 

The term format is used to refer to the way in which the information is presented, or the layout of the 
information. For example, the projected changes in annual temperature over Canada for the horizon 2050 
(the climate information) can be communicated using a table, or a map, or a regression line (the format). 

The formats presented in the guidebook have been separated into the three climate information categories. 
However, just as it was the case for the categories, the formats also represent a gradient from very simple 
representations of climate data to more complex visuals. It can be difficult at times to clearly associate them 
with one specific category. More importantly, the climate data requested may be complex and hence fall into 
the detailed category, but the way the information must be presented may need to be simplified.

Formats and user type

Climate information formats are about how to present the climate data and as such reflect a type of 
decision-maker or end-user, their expertise and preferences.
