•	 How emergency response measures are delivered should also be considered: for example, 

the location of flooding or wildfire hazards might shift or grow and make planned 
emergency routes impassable or strand fire stations, police stations, hospitals, clinics, 
ambulance stations, care facilities, transition houses, homeless shelters, pharmacies, 
airports, water treatment plants, pumping stations, works yards, utilities and other critical 
facilities.

In Kamloops the Community Wildfire Protection Plan recommends that new 
municipal water systems supplying water to new developments in areas identified 
for wildfire hazard should require emergency generators for all pumps to ensure 
continuous water supply in the event of power loss during a wildfire event.

Public transit and other needs of low-income, disabled and at-risk persons need to 
be considered in evacuation planning.

Evacuation or other options for vulnerable elderly or sick people living at home 
might need to be considered.

The needs of non-English-speaking members of the community should also be 
considered.

The needs of tourists should be included in emergency planning.

The City of Toronto has developed a “Hot Weather Response Plan” that outlines 
measures to be taken to protect vulnerable community members during a heat 
wave. www.toronto.ca/health/heatalerts/pdf/hwr_plan_2009.pdf
