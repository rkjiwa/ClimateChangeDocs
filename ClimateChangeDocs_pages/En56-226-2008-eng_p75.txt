APPENDIX 2

If the impacts are extreme heat
and weather, pollution and
shifting ranges of infectious
diseases; these pose challenges
for human health and safety

The consequences could be issues such as:
(cid:129) Human health issues combined with a range of climate-induced pressures --

such as more intense and long-lasting heatwaves—would contribute to
respiratory and cardiovascular illness, dehydration, heat stroke and mortality.
Increases in hot and stagnant weather will exacerbate smog effects of air
pollution and associated respiratory and cardiovascular disease, asthma attacks
and mortality, especially among the elderly and very young. 

(cid:129) An increasing prevalence of infectious diseases as their host organisms (e.g.:

mosquitoes carrying West Nile virus or ticks carrying Lyme disease) will
migrate northward.

These consequences could lead to potential vulnerability at the local level as
follows:
(cid:129) Heat waves will intensify in magnitude and duration over areas where they

already occur (high confidence).

(cid:129) Water-borne disease and degraded water quality are likely;
(cid:129) The range for vector-borne infectious diseases (especially Lyme and West Nile)
will shift northward; there could be an increased risk of giardia, fleas and mites 

(cid:129) Respiratory illnesses due to pollen, ozone and other factors could increase; air

quality impacts would be exacerbated by climate change 

(cid:129) Weather-related accidents could increase
