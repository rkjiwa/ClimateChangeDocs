Kamloops wildland-urban interface covenant
Kamloops (population 85 678), in the Thompson River Valley of central southern British Columbia, is particularly 
vulnerable to wildfires because of its dry climate. Wildfires are one of several risks projected to increase as a result 
of changing climate. In the summer of 2003, three large wildfires reached the city’s perimeter, threatening homes 
and infrastructure. They increased local awareness and concern about the impacts of wildfires on the community.
Covenants are one of a suite of tools the City uses in its efforts to reduce wildfire risk.39 In 1992, the City instituted 
a policy specifying that, as a condition of subdivision approval, all new subdivisions within hazardous zones must 
register a restrictive covenant.40 Under such a covenant, developers and home owners are bound to undertake 
actions to reduce fire risks, including maintaining fuel-buffer zones around homes; controlling roofing materials 
and installation of wooden shacks and shingles; screening of all eaves, attics, decks and openings under floors 
to prevent the accumulation of flammable material; and installing approved spark arresters in all wood stoves. All 
subdivisions constructed since 1992 in high to extreme wildfire hazard areas have registered restrictive wildfire 
covenants. Kamloops is revising the 1992 covenant to improve clarity and ensure it conforms to the City’s latest fire 
hazard assessment mapping.
