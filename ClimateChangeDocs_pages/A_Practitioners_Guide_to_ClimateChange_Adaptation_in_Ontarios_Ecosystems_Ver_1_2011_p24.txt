Building a Project Team 

A diverse set  of skills, perspectives,  and expertise will be required to complete a  comprehensive vulnerability assessment process 
and to begin developing and implementing adaptation measures.  

 

 

 

 

 

 Depending on the scale of the project, a team can comprise in-house staff, external experts, and other partners/stakeholders.  

 As the scale and complexity of the assessment increases, greater diversity in expert opinion may be required.  

 All members of the project team will have specific roles and responsibilities.  

 Within the project team, a leader will be required to coordinate the project, work with the assessment team experts that are 

conducting thematic vulnerability assessments, and facilitate meetings.  

 Assessment team contributors can help to identify the scope of the thematic vulnerability assessments and will conduct the 
assessments in their specific areas of expertise. Assessment team contributors will typically be scientific researchers with a 
specific area of expertise. Modelling experience is an important skill for contributors.  

 Teams may also elect team members to engage partners and 

stakeholders.  

 A steering committee made up of decision-makers and 
those who influence them can be formed to guide the 
assessment, help validate the outputs of the assessment, 
and prioritize and implement adaptation options.  

 It is recommended that teams develop a project charter to 
ensure clear understanding of roles, responsibilities, and 
expectations.
