Proper placement and
installation of the backwater
valve is extremely important.
If placed in the wrong location
relative to other plumbing
!xtures on the sanitary lateral,
the valve could be bypassed
and provide no protection.
If the valve is placed in the
wrong location, sewer backup
pressure can build up and crack
the basement "oor and lead
to "ooding. 

 

If the weeping tiles are still connected to the sanitary sewer lateral
downstream of the valve, sewage could be forced back into the
weeping tiles and lead to structural damage to the foundation, this
can also lead to in!ltration "ooding.

 

 

Like other parts of your home, backwater valves require periodic
maintenance to ensure proper performance. An improperly maintained
valve may fail during a "ood. Most mainline backwater valves come
with a see-through top so you can check to see if it is clogged with
debris. The valve should be checked regularly to ensure that it will
function properly when it is needed. You will likely need the help of a
quali!ed plumber to carry out maintenance of the valve. 

After a backwater valve has been installed do not use plumbing, for
example, "ushing toilets, running dishwashers, washing machines, or
running taps, etc. during intense rainfall events. If the home plumbing
is used when the backwater valve is closed, water will have no way 
to exit your home until the valve has reopened. If you’re not sure if the
valve is closed, check it – you should be able to see it through the
clear, plastic top.
