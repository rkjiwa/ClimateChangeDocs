PLANNING FOR 
(CLIMATE) CHANGE

Adaptation  actions  can  include  changes  in  policy,  technology,  behaviour,  management,  or 
regulation. While  the  tools  used  by  local  government  will  be  familiar  ones,  there  are  some 
important new considerations:

•	

•	

•	

The time horizon for adaptation planning will in many cases be much longer than the 
typical five-year cycles of official community plans or financial plans;

The past will no longer be a reliable indicator of the future, particularly with respect to 
natural hazards and conditions and the demands they place on infrastructure. While 
there is uncertainty about future climate change impacts, scientific information about 
trends is available and in most cases enough to begin preparing; and

Community consultation and engagement in solutions will be more important than 
ever, particularly because of the potential trade-offs that will be required.

The goal of adaptation is to reduce vulnerability and risk associated with climate change. Some 
possible examples include:

•	

•	

•	

•	

Adapting to more extreme precipitation by increasing the area of permeable surface 
to slow run-off and decrease erosion;

Adapting to sea level rise by buffering shorelines or considering alternative strategies;

Adapting to increased wildfire risks by developing a fuel treatment program and 
making changes to zoning and development permitting; and

Adapting to more frequent water shortages by improving water conservation and 
planting drought-tolerant species.

Adaptation  may  also  include  actions  that  realize  any  opportunities  presented  by  climate 
change — for example, longer growing seasons may present enhanced opportunities for local 
market gardening.

Local governments 
already plan for 
medium- and 
long term 
change — whether 
it is population 
growth, shifting 
demographics, 
new economic 
drivers or changing 
social needs — and 
climate change is 
just another factor 
of change that 
will need to be 
accounted for.
