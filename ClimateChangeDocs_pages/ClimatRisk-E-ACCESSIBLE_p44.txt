2.2 ROAD TRANSPORTATION2

In the Yukon, the land-based transportation network is relatively well-developed, with roads 
connecting all communities but one (Old Crow, the territory’s most northerly community, is linked to 
the continental mainland only seasonally via winter roads extending to Inuvik and Alaska). In contrast, 
few communities in the Northwest Territories and no communities in Nunavut are connected to 
southern Canada via the national highway system (Prolog Canada Inc., 2011). The all-weather road 
system in the Northwest Territories is being expanded through construction of a road from Tuktoyaktuk 
to Inuvik (expected to be completed in 2018) (Government of Northwest Territories, 2015a). In 
addition, ferry services have been added on the Peel and Mackenzie Rivers, and there are plans to 
extend the all-weather Mackenzie Highway further north. This highway extension would reduce the 
need for winter road use and yield potential economic benefits for communities along the route from 
Wrigley to Tuktoyaktuk (Yukon Government et al, 2008).
