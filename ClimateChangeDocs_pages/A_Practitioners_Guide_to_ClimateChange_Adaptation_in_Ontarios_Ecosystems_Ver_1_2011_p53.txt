Evaluating Adaptation Options  

Once  a  list  of  potential  adaptation  options  is  developed,  each  must  be  assessed.  A  range  of  assessment  perspectives  can  be 
applied:  

 

 

  Implementation costs;  

  Technical and institutional feasibility;  

  Likely benefits 

  Social acceptability;  

  Ecological suitability; and 

  Degree of risk in acting on adaptation options 
compared to the consequences of not acting.  

Several  methods  can  be  used  to  prioritize  adaptation 
options.  Worksheet  5.2  (below)  provides  criteria  for 
evaluating adaptation options. It is important to recognize 
and  attempt  to  mitigate  potential  shortcomings  (e.g.,  low 
participation, skewed expertise) of any evaluation. At this 
stage,  the  project  team  may  want  to  call  on  select 
stakeholders who may be responsible for implementation 
though not previously engaged in the process. Appendix 2 
lists  several  evaluation  and  prioritization  methodologies, 
such  as  cost-benefit  analysis,  expert  judgement,  multi-
criteria analysis, and cost-effectiveness analysis.  

Worksheet 5.2: Evaluating Adaptation Options 

Workshop, [Lyn Thompson, MNR] 

To evaluate adaptation options, participants assess each option against the criteria in a matrix like the example below. Other criteria 
can be developed for the evaluation as needed. Participants  are asked to exercise expert judgement and/or use their professional 
experiences  to  inform  their  evaluations.  The  project  team  then  collates  the  input  to  determine  which  adaptation  options  should  be 
considered first-order priorities.
