The tools in this primer, individually or in combination, may be used to meet the four overall strategies 
for adaptation to sea level rise. These strategies are not “pure” approaches or mutually exclusive; in fact, a 
local government may undertake different strategies for different areas following an analysis of the varying 
conditions. A protect strategy may be suitable for an historic area where all buildings and infrastructure 
would be frequently inundated without the installation of linear structural protection such as a dike. 
An accommodate strategy may apply to a new development at the margins of an area at risk of coastal 
flooding. An avoid strategy may be applied to prevent a proposed new residential development or a large 
commercial or institutional development in a previously undeveloped area at risk of flooding. Finally, a 
retreat strategy may be suitable for a rural area where the Flood Construction Level is an entire floor above 
the ground elevation. 

Over time, the choice of strategy for the same area may change due to changing circumstances, risk 
assessment or availability of resources. For example, a protect strategy relying on dikes alone may represent 
the historic approach in a particular area. With a new risk analysis, an accommodate strategy might evolve 
in which all new development is required to provide scour protection and floodproofing of buildings.

The following Compatibility Matrix shows the 21 different adaptation tools and how they relate to the 
four overall adaptation strategies. Some tools are recommended for all strategies, while other tools may 
or may not be appropriate to a particular strategy. For instance, a land trust would not be applicable to a 
protect strategy, but would be compatible with all other strategies.
