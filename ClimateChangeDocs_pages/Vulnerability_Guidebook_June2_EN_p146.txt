Appendix 1.  Glossary

Adaptation
 “Adjustment in natural or human systems in response to actual or expected climatic 
stimuli or their effects, which moderates harm or exploits beneficial opportunities” (Parry 
et al. 2007).

Adaptation options
Potential actions or activities to address or reduce the vulnerabilities identified in a 
vulnerability assessment.

Adaptation recommendations
A subset of adaptation options, consisting of those options that will benefit sustainable 
forest management objectives and for which implementation is acceptable and feasible.

Adaptive capacity
“The ability of a system to adjust to climate change (including climate variability and 
extremes) to moderate potential damages, to take advantage of opportunities, or to cope 
with the consequences” (Parry et al. 2007). In this report, adaptive capacity refers to the 
human (as opposed to the biological) components of the sustainable forest management 
system.

Adaptive capacity assessment
Assessment of (1) the human and institutional resources and capacities (for example, 
human capital, social capital) available to identify adaptation requirements and to 
implement adaptation actions; (2) the structural attributes, properties, and characteristics 
that affect the ability of a system to adapt (for example, flexibility, rigidity, diversity, 
liquidity, substitutability); and (3) the factors that impair optimal choices related to 
adaptation and adaptive capacity requirements (for example, inefficient institutions, 
critical knowledge gaps, lack of awareness, biased perceptions of risk).

Adaptive management
“A systematic process for continually improving management policies and practices by 
learning from the outcomes of previously employed policies and practices” (MEA 2005).  

Climate
“Climate in a narrow sense is usually defined as the ‘average weather’, or more rigorously, 
as the statistical description in terms of the mean and variability of relevant quantities over 
a period of time ranging from months to thousands or millions of years. These quantities 
are most often surface variables such as temperature, precipitation, and wind. Climate
