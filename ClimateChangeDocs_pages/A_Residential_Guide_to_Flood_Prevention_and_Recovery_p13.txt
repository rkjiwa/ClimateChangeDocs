Maintenance
Regular maintenance of your home drainage system can 
often be the difference between staying dry and being 
flooded. It is good practice to evaluate the condition of 
your system – inside and out, on a regular basis. If you find 
a problem, make fixing it a priority. 
Below is a checklist of what to do for backwater valve 
maintenance:
• Visually check the valve.
• Open the top and clean out any debris, if needed.
• Check the flapper for free movement up and down.

Remember:

If you are aware of surcharging, 
or wastewater backing up from 
the sewer main, do not use 
your water otherwise you risk 
flooding. Once surcharging 
has subsided, you may restore 
regular water use.
