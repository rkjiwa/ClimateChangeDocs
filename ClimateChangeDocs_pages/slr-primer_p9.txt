Introduction

Even if greenhouse gas emissions halt tomorrow, the impacts of climate change will continue into the 
foreseeable future. One of the recognized impacts of climate change – and potentially the most dramatic 
for the many coastal communities of Canada – is sea level rise (SLR).2
As oceans warm, they expand, raising global sea levels. Melting ice caps, mountain glaciers, and land based 
ice sheets (e.g. Antarctica and Greenland) also contribute to rising sea levels. In several areas on Canada’s 
coast, geophysical factors, including subsidence and tectonic forces, also play a role. Coastal hazards 
associated with sea level rise include coastal inundation, erosion, loss of intertidal habitat (‘coastal squeeze’) 
and loss of sea ice. Climate change also brings the prospect of more frequent and intense storms and floods 
– particularly if storms occur during high tides.3 

Observed Changes in Sea Level
In the latter part of the 19th century and during the 20th century, the global mean sea level rose at  
a rate of about 1.7 mm/year (17 cm/century).4 Since 1993, the rate of global sea level rise has increased  
to around 3 mm/year.

The red curve shows reconstructed sea levels from 1870 to 1950. The blue curve shows coastal tide gauge 
measurements from 1950, and the black curve is based on satellite altimetry. The upper and lower limits in 
the curves show 90% confidence levels, which have narrowed over time due to the increasing accuracy of 
data measurement techniques.
