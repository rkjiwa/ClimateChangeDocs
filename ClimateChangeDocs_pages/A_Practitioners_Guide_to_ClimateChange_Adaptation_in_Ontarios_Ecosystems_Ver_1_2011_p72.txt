There is no doubt that assessment teams may identify a large suite of potential adaptation options. Measures may span a variety of 
themes  and  approaches  –  from  changes  to  policy,  management,  and  practices,  to  public  awareness  and  communications,  to 
monitoring and scientific research.  

 

 

 

Prioritize Risks 

  Collate vulnerability assessments and summarize results from risk assessment 

Plan Delphi Process 

  Determine sampling strategy and questions 
 
Identify and secure committed participants 

Delphi Round 1: Identification of Adaptation Options 

  Circulate vulnerability assessment results and key risks  
  Solicit adaptation recommendations via questionnaire 
  Analyze responses 

Delphi Round 2: Evaluation of Adaptation Options 

  Establish evaluation criteria 
  Solicit ratings based on Round 2 questionnaire 
  Analyze responses for consensus/disagreement 

 

Analysis and Final Report 

  Analysis of results (e.g., simple statistics, and tabulation, etc.) 
  Prepare final consensus statements of first and second priority adaptation options 
  Distribute final report to stakeholders
