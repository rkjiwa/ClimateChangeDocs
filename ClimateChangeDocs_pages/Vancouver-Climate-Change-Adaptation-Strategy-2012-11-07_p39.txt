Complete mapping for areas vulnerable to heat extremes.

external partnership in progress 

Assess potential for cooling rooms in non-market housing. 

Use UHie and vulnerability mapping overlays to target locations for additional 
green spaces, parks and trees. 
Continue to expand public access to drinking water. 

Monitor C.Bs in combined areas for increases in odour. Anticipate increases  
in response. 
partner with VCH to undertake a climate change health vulnerability analysis 
as per Health Canada
explore implementation of Buddy system/Block captains building on existing 
programs. Can be used for other impacts e.g. cleaning catch basins, checking 
on isolated neighbours during heat waves, etc.

4.2 water supply shortages in late summer could drive expensive ad hoc capital upgrades and source expansion.
aCtion
implement greenest City Action plan Clean Water actions to reduce water use: 
water metering, water conservation, system leakage reduction and lawn  
sprinkling enforcement projects. 
identify areas such as medians and pilot zero irrigation/use of rainwater.
