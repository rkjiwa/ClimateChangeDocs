This category only includes information about projected future climate changes. The climate information 
produced for this category often tends to be for a more specific spatial scale than the information produced 
in the basic category. Consequently, the climate information is increasingly tailored to suit the specific needs 
of  users.  The  examples  shown  here  will  help  users  familiarize  themselves  with  the  interpretation  of  the 
different formats.
Five examples are presented to highlight how climate information can be tailored using varying levels of 
complexity. From the simplest format to the most complex, they are:

 ›

 ›

Spatial analogues – used to present where the historical climate will be in the future

Scatter plots –used to show changes in climate variables for different climate simulations

 › Map of projected future values – used to present projected future values of a climate variable

 › Evolution of future values – used to present projected evolution of future values

 › Cumulative distribution function – used to present the distribution of the projected future values

Note that the last three formats show the same climate information for the exact same location – they are 
therefore a good example of what is meant by «presenting the same climate information using different 
formats».
