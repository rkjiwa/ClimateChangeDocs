Taking action on your own

These actions will not guarantee the safety of your home, but can help
minimize and prevent winter weather damage. 

Protecting Your Home
Full or partial roof collapse, ice dams and frozen pipes are the major
threats that homeowner’s should be aware of during periods of
extreme winter weather. Heavy snowfall and ice build up can threaten
your roof’s structural integrity, but also lead to water damage as snow
or ice melts and seeps into your home. Extreme cold snaps can freeze
pipes, which can cause signi!cant water damage if the pipe bursts.

Roof collapse can occur after a signi!cant snowfall, freezing rain, 
or a series of intermittent snow or ice events throughout the winter
season. The !rst step in preventing roof collapse is to determine
whether your roof is susceptible to signi!cant snow or ice
accumulation. Your roof’s
slope is the most
important factor in helping
shed snow or melting
water. The lower the
slope, the more exposed
your roof is towards heavy
snow and ice build-up. 

According to most
builders, a “4 on 12” roof
with a slope that is greater
than 10cm (vertically) in
30cm (horizontally) will
shed most snow and ice.
But even with a sloped roof, snow and ice can still build up on "atter
areas of the roof. Obstructions, such as chimneys, skylights or dormers,
are particularly susceptible to snow build-up. 

Roof collapse can be a stressful and expensive 
experience for homeowners..
