Community/Land Use Planning and Hazard Management 
Climate Change literature often refers to four main strategies to manage SLR: 
  Avoid 
  Protect 
  Accommodate 
  Retreat. 
Each  of  these  strategies has  been named  in  prior examples.  For  a  more  in-depth  description  of 
each of these strategies, refer to the “Policy Discussion Document 2010”.  

Land Use Management Tools 
Tools that local governments can use to apply one or more of the land use strategies discussed in 
this chapter include: 
  Official Community Plans - hazard land identification and SLR Planning Area designation, 
  Zoning bylaws – “risk zoning”, as discussed above.  
  S 910 Flood Plain Bylaw 
  OCP Development  Permit  Area  for  Protection  of Development  from  Hazardous  Conditions – 

guidelines and requirements for developing in hazard areas. 

  Restrictive covenants. 
  Public education – about the hazards and ways that individuals can address them. 
  Early warning and emergency preparedness programs. 
Requirements  for  FCL  and  Setback  in  the  planning  documents  would  vary  periodically  in 
accordance with an Adaptive Risk Management approach – establishing new levels as Sea Level 
Rise projections become more defined.

On-Going Guidance 
Examples  of  different  methods  of  adapting  to  SLR  in  southern  BC  are  under  development  by  a 
parallel project also sponsored by the Natural Resources Canada Regional Adaption Collaborative 
(RAC)5.
