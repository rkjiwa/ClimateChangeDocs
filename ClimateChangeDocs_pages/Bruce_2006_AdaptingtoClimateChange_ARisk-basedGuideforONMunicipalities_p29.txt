Conduct a focus group or brainstorm session 
with key stakeholders to identify everything that 
is needed in the documentation library, including 
knowledge transfer, financial resources and 
authorities. 
Finally, the plan contains an effective 
communication strategy for program support.  

 

This should include communication about the 
residual risks.  Target audiences have been 
identified and information and other supporting 
materials (such as t-shirts, brochures etc.) have 
been specified.
