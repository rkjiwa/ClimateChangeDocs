The Office of the Secretary of Defense requested information from the Military 

Departments for climate-related events.  To ensure connection to mission impacts, DoD focused 
on 79 mission assurance priority installations based on their operational role.  The Office of the 
Secretary of Defense requested Military Departments analyze the climate-related events at these 
installations.  The installations break down by organization as follows1: 
 

 

Air Force 
Army 
Navy 
Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) 
Defense Financing and Accounting Service (DFAS) 
Washington Headquarters Service (WHS)

I.  Summary of Climate Effects and Vulnerabilities 
 
INSTALLATIONS & INFRASTRUCTURE  
 
Methodology for Installation Effects  
 

The Military Departments noted the presence or not of current and potential 

vulnerabilities to each installation over the next 20 years, selecting from the events listed below.  
Note that the congressional request established the 20-year timeframe. 
 
Climate-Related Events 
•  Recurrent Flooding 
•  Drought 
•  Desertification 
•  Wildfires 
•  Thawing Permafrost 

 
 
Military Department input on the 79 installations is included in the Appendix, which is 
sorted by Military Service.  In preparing input for the Appendix, the Military Services were free 
to select information sources they deemed relevant2.
