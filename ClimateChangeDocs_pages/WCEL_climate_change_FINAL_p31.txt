decision-making. Although the OCP itself does not legally bind a local government to proceed with 
any project, putting climate change adaptation policy objectives in the OCP ensures that subsequent 
legal enactments, such as zoning bylaws, must be consistent with those objectives.

The OCP can offer a relatively long term planning horizon, and local governments could consider 
a planning horizon of 50–100 years in relation to the development of climate change policies and 
objectives aimed at shifting developments and land use patterns over time. It is important to antici-
pate future climate impacts now, before decisions made today result in safety hazards or expensive 
damage to infrastructure over the longer term. The draft City of Prince George OCP indicates, for 
example, that the climate change impact priorities it has identified should be considered in new 
development proposals.18

Having climate change adaptation objectives identified in the OCP can also provide ongoing mo-
mentum for local government action, and a rationale for committing resources for adaptation work. 
The Thetis Island OCP states that “The Local Trust Committee should consider the development of 
new criteria for assessing official community plan or land use bylaw amendment applications from 
the perspective of climate change adaptation and mitigation.”19

An  OCP  can  also  direct  a  local  government  to  take  action  to  further  its  own  strategic  objectives 
through cooperation and partnership with other governments and organizations. The draft Victoria 
OCP offers this policy:

Continue and enhance partnerships with senior, regional and local governments, public 
agencies, community organizations, businesses and individuals for the efficient and 
effective coordination of climate change and energy resiliency plans, policies and initiatives 
including….[r]isk and vulnerability assessment of local climate change impacts.20

Although the OCP 
itself does not 
legally bind a local 
government to 
proceed with any 
project, putting 
climate change 
adaptation policy 
objectives in the 
OCP means that 
subsequent legal 
enactments, such as 
zoning bylaws, must 
be consistent with 
those objectives.
