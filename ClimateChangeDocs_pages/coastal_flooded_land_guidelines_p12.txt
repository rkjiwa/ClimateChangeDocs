1 Based on current values for areas (Vancouver and Squamish taken to be neutral due to regional variations or 
present lack of site specific data) 
2  Varies  by  site  and  location  in  BC,  as  defined  by  CHS  Tide  Tables  for  areas,  –  Cowichan  Bay  used  for  East 
Vancouver Island – Tofino used for West Vancouver Island - Queen Charlotte City used for Central and North 
Coast. 
3 Recommended value for AEP based on “Policy Discussion Paper 2010” – includes allowances for local wind 
setup. 
4 Based on wave runup on natural gravel – pebble beach shoreline. 
5 Assumes no Flood Proofing, specific Building Foundation type, or Tsunami.

Adaptive Risk Management in the Face of Uncertainty 
To provide balance between economic development objectives and the precautionary principle, an 
Adaptive Risk Management approach to Sea Level Rise is warranted.  
Land  use  and  building  approvals  based  on  FCL  for  2100  should  also  include  provisions  for 
adaptive management of land uses to Sea Level Rise to the Year 2200 and beyond. The long term 
view should also apply when approval of a lot parcel or a building implies a change (increase) in 
the intensity of land use that extends beyond the life of building. 
An  Adaptive  Risk  Management  Approach  to  SLR  would  plan  how  short  term  land  uses  and 
structures can be occupied with reasonable risk for their lifespan, but at the same time recognize 
and allow that future SLR may require the redesign to a higher elevation or relocation of the next 
generation of land uses and structures at a given coastal site.
