SFM Management Objectives
Defining management objectives is a key task within the SFM vulnerability assessment 
framework, as it is these objectives that form the basis of the assessment. 

The central question of an SFM vulnerability assessment is 
whether SFM objectives can be met with current policies and 
practices, given the current climate and a range of potential 
future climates. 

Most forest management plans in Canada include clearly stated management objectives 
that define the desired future forest conditions or economic and societal outcomes of 
management actions, with criteria and measurable indicators to report progress toward 
meeting those objectives (see sidebar Canadian Council of Forest Ministers’ Criteria 
and Indicators Framework). For many forest management plans with third-party 
certification, these objectives and indicators may already be well defined. 

Key Nonclimatic SFM Factors
Climate change vulnerability assessments should not be conducted in isolation from other 
key management factors that already have influenced SFM (or may influence SFM over 
time). Today, many Canadian forest-sector operations must contend with competition for 
workers, an aging workforce, severe financial pressures, and shifts in land use and public 
values. Climate change is a cross-cutting issue that should be considered along with other 
factors of change. The impacts of climate change may inhibit or enhance the effects of 
these other factors. Likewise, these other factors may affect the ability to successfully 
implement adaptation options.

Canadian Council of Forest Ministers Criteria and Indicators Framework

The Canadian Criteria and Indicators Framework of the Canadian Council of Forest Ministers (CCFM) is a 
science-based framework used to define and measure Canada’s progress in SFM. The criteria represent 
forest values that Canadians want to enhance or sustain, with the indicators identifying scientific factors 
that can be used to assess the state of the forests and measure progress over time (see Appendix 3 for the 
list of current CCFM SFM Criteria and Indictors). 

The framework was created in 1995 and was most recently updated in 2003 (CCFM 2003).  
A national status report was prepared in 2005 (CCFM 2006).
