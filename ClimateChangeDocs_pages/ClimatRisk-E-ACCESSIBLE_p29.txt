AIR TRANSPORT 

Many of the impacts to air transport illustrated in Figure 4 can lead to flight delays, diversions and 
cancellations. Few accidents are caused by weather conditions in the absence of other contributing 
factors. Instrument landing systems and other innovations allow aircraft to fly safely in difficult weather 
conditions, and aircraft are grounded in conditions considered unsafe for flight. Climate risks to airport 
infrastructure tend to present greater challenges for smaller airports in Canada, which lack the same 
technologies and resources as larger airports.
