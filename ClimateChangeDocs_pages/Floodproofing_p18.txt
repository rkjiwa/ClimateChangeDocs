Floodproofing for Utilities 
 
If the utilities serving a building are damaged, even a structurally 
sound residence may be rendered uninhabitable after a flood due 
to  unsafe  or  unsanitary  conditions.  This  risk  can  be  reduced  by 
incorporating floodproofing features into the services contained in 
existing buildings. This is particularly important when furnaces and 
other vulnerable facilities are located in a basement and when wet 
floodproofing  is  being  employed.    When  floodproofing  building 
utilities, primary consideration should be given to preventing flood 
waters from contacting the components that are most susceptible 
to water damage.    
 
Some  potential  measures  are  included  in  Table  1  (below),  and 
described  in  more  detail  in  references  contained  in  Additional 
Information on Floodproofing at the end of this booklet.  
 
Remember: 

  All measures and modifications must adhere to the all 

applicable provisions of the National Building Code and 
National Fire Code.

Case Study: The “Upside-Down 
House” 
 
When  a  property  was  badly 
damaged  by 
local 
builder saw an opportunity.  “You 
have  to  find  unique  spots  for  the 
mechanical 
that 
normally  you  would  cram  in  a 
basement”. The basement has no 
windows and contains only piping 
and  ductwork.  A  small  upstairs 
room houses one of two furnaces 
—  designed  to  force  air  down 
rather  than  up  —  complete  with 
sound insulation.

Advantages 
 
 
 
1. Elevated circuitry is completely 
protected from damage. 
 
2. May avoid costly “behind the wall” 
failures in the event of a flood.

Install  separate,  waterproof  circuits 
for  outlets,  switches,  and  lighting

If  wiring  must  be  located  below  the 
flood  elevation,  install  it  within  a 
small  diameter  plastic  pipe  (conduit) 
to  facilitate  future  replacement  and 
repair of wiring.
