The District of Lantzville Subdivision and Development Bylaw incorporates green 
infrastructure measures for rainwater management and requires the developer to 
post security equivalent to the cost of three years of maintenance, to ensure that the 
measures are operational. www.lantzville.ca/cms/wpattachments/wpID478atID3187.pdf

The District of Sooke is drafting a new Subdivision and Development Standard Bylaw 
that promotes green infrastructure for rainwater capture, and will likely include a 
requirement for developers to employ the Water Balance Model (a decision support 
tool that looks at rainwater management and stream health protection, http://
bc.waterbalance.ca/) for new developments. www.sooke.ca/EN/main/government/
devservices/environment/lwm_rain.html

The City of North Vancouver amended its Subdivision and Development Control Bylaw 
to ensure greater resilience in its energy infrastructure after a 2008 windstorm caused 
trees and branches to fall on overhead power lines, resulting in neighbourhood power 
outages. Underground power and communications connections are now required for 
some developments. www.cnv.org/c//data/1/84/subdivision%20&%20development%20

To consider:

The decisions made about infrastructure in new developments and re-developed areas 
will have long-lasting consequences — what is specified today will need to perform 
well in conditions decades from now, and to be resilient to the future impacts of climate 
change. Retrofits to existing infrastructure can be very costly, so it will be important to 
employ design approaches that offer flexibility, anticipate a range of possible climate 
change impacts and reduce the risk of infrastructure failures.

Pedestrian and bike friendly neighbourhoods where motorized transportation is less 
necessary will be more resilient to rising energy costs, an indirect impact of climate 
change, and subdivision servicing bylaws can include requirements for pedestrian and 
bike trails, and roads that are safe and attractive for pedestrian and bicycle use. The City 
of Courtenay OCP was recently amended to promote such measures.30
