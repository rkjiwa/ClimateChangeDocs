There is a large body of evidence summarizing the multiple impacts of climate change on 
health. This technical synthesis collates scientific information on this subject, and presents 
considerations pertaining to health and public health. Though health is the focus of this paper, 
it is important to encourage a collective and integrated thinking and response from multiple 
sectors in addressing, mitigating or adapting to the challenges that are posed. Among the many 
references consulted, a few key scientific reports of particular relevance complement this work. 
These include: The Chief Public Health Officer’s 2014 report on the state of Public health in 
Canada, public health in a changing climate (71); Human health in Canada in a changing 
climate: sector perspectives on impacts and adaptation (47); and Health and climate change: 
policy responses to protect public health (69), by the Lancet Commission.
