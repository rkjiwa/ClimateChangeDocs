INTRODUCTION 

Figure 1 does not capture the factors that will likely challenge
the  progress  toward  a  sustainable  development  pathway.
These include competing priorities, limited resources and
different understandings of sustainability. In the next section,
we outline a process to help local communities navigate these

challenges while defining development strategies that will
enable  them  to  minimize  their  vulnerabilities  to  climate
change  (adaptation)  and  respond  to  regional  and  global
greenhouse gas reduction efforts (mitigation). 

A

Vulnerability Reduced

Adaptive Emissions
e.g. Expanded use of air conditioning;
construction of sea walls

Emissions Increased

SAM
e.g. Drought preparedness through  demand
side management; expanded application of
recycling and conservation principles

Emissions Reduced

M

Unsustainability
e.g. Rapid deforestation for land use
change (agriculture, mining, etc)

New Vulnerabilities
e.g. Switch from fossil fuels to expanded
large hydro development

Vulnerability
Increased
