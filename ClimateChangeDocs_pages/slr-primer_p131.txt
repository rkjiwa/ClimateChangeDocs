Partners for Climate Protection. Municipal Resources for Adapting to Climate Change. Ottawa, Ontario: 

 

Federation of Canadian Municipalities, 2009. Available at:  
http://www.fcm.ca/Documents/reports/PCP/Municipal_Resources_for_Adapting_to_Climate_Change_EN.pdf
The purpose of this resource is to provide information to Partners for Climate Protection (PCP) members 
and other municipal officials about municipal adaptation initiatives and to provide resources for 
municipal officials who wish to undertake adaptation planning. Emphasis is placed on different climate 
change impacts within regions and the importance for municipalities to take some time to investigate 
the specific risks for their communities. The document discusses the difference between mitigation and 
adaptation. The types of assessment and the preventative actions required for adaptation are for the 
most part significantly different than for mitigation. The development of an adaptation strategy begins 
with an assessment of climate change vulnerabilities – to heat, precipitation, extreme weather, wind 
speed, sea level rise, melting permafrost, changes in climate zones that affect plant, animal and insect 
species, and other factors.

Province of Nova Scotia. Our Coast. The 2009 State of Nova Scotia’s Coast Summary Report, Halifax: Province 

 

of Nova Scotia, 2009. Available at:  
http://www.gov.ns.ca/coast/documents/state-of-the-coast/WEB_SummaryReport.pdf
This summary report is a complete overview of the 2009 State of Nova Scotia’s Cost Technical Report 
and summarizes the condition of the coastal areas and resources of Nova Scotia. The full technical 
report is available at: http://www.gov.ns.ca/coast/state-of-the-coast.asp. The purpose of this report 
is to create a baseline to determine future trends, and it describes the physical, ecological and socio-
economic characteristic of the coast. Six priorities are identified and examined in detail – one of which 
is sea level rise and storm events – more specifically, an examination of the factors that determine sea 
level rise in Nova Scotia and to examine the social, economic and ecological implications of the hazards 
associated with sea level rise and storm events. The report recognizes gaps in information that need to 
be addressed in order to effectively manage the coast.
