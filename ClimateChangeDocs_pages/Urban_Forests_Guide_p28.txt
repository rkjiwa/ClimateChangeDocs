per wheel to a maximum of 14,515 kg per 
axle. Greater rooting space allows trees to 
grow larger, and thus provide more shade, 
interception and other benefits. Although 
soil cells appear to be more expensive, they 
provide significantly more soil per unit 
volume than structural soils so less product 
is required, reducing the relative cost.
•	 Retain large natural treed areas, which 
typically absorb and store more water 
than disturbed areas. The runoff from an 
undisturbed remnant forest is negligible 
compared to open ground and even turf 
areas. Native understory will support treed 
areas much better than lawns, which have a 
poor infiltration rate (at times only slightly 
better than pavement).

•	 Maintain or restore the historical surficial 

hydrology of a site when retaining existing 
trees and vegetation in new developments. 
Very often, natural water movement on a 
site is changed by development and the 
vegetation that depended on that water

one-third that of native soil so a large space 
is required to support each tree (inadequate 
soil volume leads to premature decline of 
trees).  
Soil cells are modular, pre-engineered 
plastic cells—much like milk baskets—
which are locked together and filled with 
soil. The cell structure and pavement takes 
the load of the traffic, while tree roots 
make use of the soil as a growing medium. 
Soil cells provide significantly more soil 
per volume than structural soils and are 
designed to meet a support up to 3,630 kg
