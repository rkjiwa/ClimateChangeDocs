GUIDEBOOK FOR ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE 

step-by-step guidelines

STEP 3 Develop a vision of the future. Where do

we want to be in the coming decades?

The following framework aims to promote development of
adaptation  responses  with  mitigation  co-benefits  that  are
tailored to local long-term priorities. To achieve this aim, we
suggest a framework of five major steps starting with the
selection of the focus of the SAM project and ending with a
strategy to implement the actions and define potential follow-
up  activities.  The  framework  includes  the  following  five
major steps:

SAM initiative

STEP 1 Identify the focus and objectives of a
STEP 2 Assess present status and trends. Where

are we heading now? 

a.  Identify future development priorities based on the

principles of local sustainability and community
planning 

b.  Assess impacts of climate change and the potential for

adaptation and mitigation within community goals 

STEP 4 Set trajectories to meet priorities. How can

we get there?

a.  Identify actions to achieve the vision of the future 
b.  Develop capacities and institutional linkages to support

implementation

STEP 5 Monitor, reassess and adjust.

Reexamining the identified actions in a

project or addressing new challenges  

a.  Examine current development challenges, planning

principles and capacities

b. Estimate impacts of climate change

The  following  section  presents
the  five  steps,  briefly
describing suggested methods, process and outputs. Each step
