Observed Changes

Projected Changes

Sea levels will continue to change.
 • Estimates of future changes in global 

sea level by the year 2100 range from a 
few tens of centimetres to more than a 
metre.

 • Projected changes in Canada range 
from increases of up to 100 cm on the 
Atlantic, Pacific, and Beaufort coasts, 
to decreases of almost 100 cm in the 
central Arctic.

The extent and thickness of sea ice in 
the Canadian Arctic will continue to 
decrease. 
 • Some models project a nearly ice-free 

summer before mid-century in the 
Arctic Ocean. Summer sea ice may 
persist longer in the Canadian Arctic 
Archipelago region.

Sea levels have changed in Canada.
 • Relative sea level has been rising in 

Atlantic Canada and the Beaufort Sea 
(over 3 mm/year), and on the Pacific 
coast to a lesser extent. (Average 
global sea level rose 1.6 mm/year 
between 1880 and 2012).  

 • Where sea level has risen, storm 

surges and coastal erosion have been 
amplified (Atkinson et al., 2016). 

 • Relative sea level has been falling in 

areas where land has been rising due 
to post-glacial rebound. Relative sea 
level has declined about 10 mm/year 
around Hudson Bay. 

Arctic sea ice extent has decreased 
significantly.  
 • Minimum ice extent at the end of 
summer has declined by 13% per 
decade over 1979-2012. Maximum 
winter sea ice extent has declined by 
2.6% per decade.  

 • Ice cover has become increasingly 
dominated by thin first-year ice, with 
significant reduction in the extent of 
thick multi-year ice.

 • Winter sea ice has also declined in the 

Labrador-Newfoundland and Gulf of St. 
Lawrence region.

Lake and River Ice  

Inland water levels

Ice cover duration has been decreasing.
 • Most of Canada has seen trends 

towards earlier ice-free dates (lakes) 
and ice break-up dates (rivers) since 
the mid-20th century, and this trend is 
particularly evident in Western Canada.

Duration of ice cover is projected to 
continue to decrease.
 • Earlier break-up dates and later freeze 

up dates are projected to decrease 
ice cover duration by up to a month by 
mid-century.

Inland water levels have been highly 
variable with episodes of lower than 
normal levels.
 • Great Lakes Water levels were  

below long-term averages from 1997  
to 2012 (Shlozberg et al, 2014) but 
higher than normal in 2013 and 
2014. (Dorling and Hanniman, 2016; 
Great Lakes Environmental Research 
Laboratory, 2015).

Inland water levels are expected to 
continue to fluctuate, with a projected 
trend towards lower water levels.
 • Episodes of low water levels are 

projected to occur more frequently in 
some freshwater bodies (e.g., the Great 
Lakes and Mackenzie River).

 • Some models project decreases in 

water levels of 0.5 to 1 m in the  
Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River  
by 2055 (Shlozberg et al, 2014; Brown  
et al., 2012).
