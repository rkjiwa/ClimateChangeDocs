In addition to tools available to local governments, insurance and emergency management are also 
adaptation tools included in the Primer. Overland flood insurance for residential development, while not 
a tool available to the public or any level of government in Canada, is discussed as it plays a major role 
in all other G8 countries. Emergency management is a tool available to communities across Canada, but 
responsibility for emergency management is shared with senior governments.

Also included in the Primer are appendices consisting of: acronyms; a glossary of terms; a spreadsheet 
profiling the adaptation tools; legislative matrices in B.C. and Atlantic Canada; and a wide range of 
municipal policies and bylaws in Atlantic Canada. The Primer concludes with both an annotated 
bibliography and a bibliography organized into four geographic areas: Canada, Quebec, U.S.A.,  
and other international areas.
