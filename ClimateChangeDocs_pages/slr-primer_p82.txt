Combinations & Compatibility

The 21 tools in this primer have been organized into five broad categories: planning, regulatory, land use 
change or restriction, structural and non-structural. These five categories are intended to assist decision 
makers in the selection, application and combination of these tools.

Several of the tools are interdependent and should be used in combination, producing hybrid shoreline 
protection systems. At first glance, structural and non-structural adaptation tools may appear to represent 
opposing approaches; however, they are often used in combination. Non-structural tools, sometimes referred 
to as soft armouring or soft engineering, offer flexibility and can reduce the costs of construction and negative 
environmental effects incurred by using structural tools alone.

Hybrid techniques from P.E.I.

Hybrid techniques were implemented at the Crowbush Golf Course on P.E.I. after a major storm surge in 
December, 2004. At Crowbush Cove, a low-lying armour stone base, known as a revetment, was installed 
parallel to the shoreline. Sand was placed on top of the revetment to re-establish the dune in the area, 
and marram grass was re-seeded on the dune to help with stabilization. After storm events, removed 
sand must be replaced. The same type of system was installed on the Panmure Island Causeway.
