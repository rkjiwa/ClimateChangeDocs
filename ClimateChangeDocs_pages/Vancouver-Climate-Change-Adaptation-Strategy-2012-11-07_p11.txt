tagged as “monitor” are actions that have good benefit to cost ratio but given  
long timelines until anticipated impacts, it makes sense to wait to implement 
these actions until certain thresholds of climate change are observed. Lastly, 
“investigate further” are actions where the benefit to cost ratio is unclear 
and more consideration is required. 

muSt Do

Actions relating to climate impacts already being observed or that have 
a life safety component and actions with a high benefit to cost ratio.

monitor

Actions relating to impacts that will be observed in the long term and 
that have a high benefit to cost ratio. Actions will be implemented when 
specific climate thresholds are surpassed or changes observed.
