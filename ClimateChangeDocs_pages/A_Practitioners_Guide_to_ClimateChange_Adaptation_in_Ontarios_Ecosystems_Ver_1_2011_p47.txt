Worksheet 4.5: Describing Risk 

With  information  on  the  severity  of  consequences  and  likelihood  of  impacts,  assign  a  qualitative  classification  of  risk  for  each 
indicator as High (H), Medium (M), or Low (L).  

Teams should use judgement when applying numerical risk ratings. Some risks that are classified as “low” may be safe to ignore or 
can be dealt with at a later time. However, it is important to remember:  

  Several low risks can cumulatively pose significant challenges to the organization;  

  There may be non-linear ecosystem responses as a result of impacts rated as low risk; and  

  Over time risks may become more severe. Therefore, even low risk climate change impacts may require monitoring. 

Project teams could consider describing risks graphically or using other approaches.
