CENTRAL SUB-REGION

The central sub-region, which includes Sudbury, Thunder Bay, and Timmins, is composed almost 
entirely of the forested and rocky terrain of the Precambrian Shield. Its summers are humid and mild, 
and precipitation is distributed evenly throughout the seasons (Baldwin et al, 2011). There are many 
low-density, resource-dependent communities, notably in the forestry, pulp-and-paper, mining, 
and tourism sectors. It contains two-thirds of Ontario’s highway system, which along with the rail 
network, is important in connecting the area’s resource producers to markets in other areas of the 
province, country, and continent (Chiotti and Lavender, 2008). The sub-region’s remote communities 
and extractive industries also depend greatly on more than 3,000 km of seasonal-access roads for 
economic well-being, social stability, and surface freight movement in winter (Ontario Ministry of 
Northern Development and Mines, 2013).

NORTHERN SUB-REGION

The northern sub-region extends from the upper boundary of Central Ontario to the coasts of Hudson 
and James Bay. The topography and landscape are largely low-lying and poorly-drained, containing 
the majority of the province’s permafrost in the cryosolic (i.e. frozen) soils of the northwest (Baldwin et 
al, 2011). Northern Ontario has a subarctic climate, with long, severe winters and short, cool summers. 
Temperatures of -40˚C are common (although temperature is highly variable year-round), and annual 
precipitation is lower than in other sub-regions (Baldwin et al, 2011). Northern communities are also 
remote, and many rely solely upon aviation for connectivity.

1.2 SOCIAL AND DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS

Ontario is the fastest-growing province in Canada, with an estimated population of 13.8 million in 2015 
(Statistics Canada, 2014, Table 1). Significant growth is expected to continue well into the 21st century, 
with implications for future demands on passenger and freight transportation systems throughout the 
province. Approximately 17.4 million people are projected by 2036 (Ontario Ministry of Finance, 2013).

Eighty-nine percent of the province’s population lives within Census Metropolitan Areas (CMAs) or 
Census Agglomerations (CAs) (Statistics Canada, 2012). Most of the province’s future growth will 
continue to be concentrated in urban areas; therefore, Ontarians will increasingly live and work in 
denser, more transit-accessible neighborhoods. The Greater Golden Horseshoe (GGH) in Southern 
Ontario will absorb most of this growth, primarily through immigration (Ontario Ministry of Finance, 2013).

 Note that these regionally-specific population projections are approximate, given that the climate sub-regions fail to align  
perfectly with the jurisdictional boundaries used in the collection and analysis of census data.
