Environmental – Environmental considerations include the environmental benefit of the wetland creation 
or restoration such as new or enhanced habitat for fish and shellfish and improved water quality.

Social – Passive recreational activities, such as bird watching and interpretive opportunities, may 
complement the creation of coastal wetlands. Passive recreational features include elevated walkways, at 
grade walkways subject to periodic flooding, blinds and waterfowl observation towers for naturalists. In 
conjunction with other tools, wetland creation may reduce the land requirements for linear protection.

Implementation Measures and Challenges 
Like any tool, the appropriateness of wetland or salt marsh restoration must be evaluated on a site-by-site 
basis. Understanding the biophysical conditions under which restoration is being considered is particularly 
important as these may ultimately determine the long-term sustainability of a restored wetland or marsh.104 
Implementation measures include land acquisition, foreshore lease, covenant or other form of protection. 
An assessment of the area by a Registered Professional Biologist or other qualified professional should 
take place. Financial resources are required to undertake the necessary investment to create or restore 
the wetland; and an organization such as a land trust may be required to manage the wetland. Challenges 
include acquiring the wetland area (i.e., tenure from a private land owner), securing the necessary funds 
and undertaking long-term maintenance.
