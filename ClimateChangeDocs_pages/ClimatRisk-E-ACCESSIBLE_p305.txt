Climate hazards and 

impacts

Increased freeze-
thaw cycles

Adaptations for roads, bridges, 
and associated infrastructure 
(including signals, stormwater 

management)

Adaptations for urban rail 
infrastructure and operations

•  Monitoring of freeze-thaw 

•  No examples found in the 

cycles, traffic levels, and 
rehabilitation requirements to 
inform budgetary changes

Extreme heat 
(thermal expansion 
of bridges, pavement 
degradation, rail 
buckling, etc.)

•  Using heat-resistant pavement 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

materials
Installing cooling systems for 
diesel engines
Increasing frequency of bridge 
maintenance
Installing traffic signal cooling 
fans/switch heaters and using 
them during periods of extreme 
temperature
Increasing the frequency of 
night-time construction

•  Using light-coloured pavement 

Installing cooling systems and 
track signal switch heaters

•  Adopting speed restrictions and 
service reductions to cope with 
rail buckling

•  Changing rail distressing 
temperatures to reduce 
likelihood of rail buckling
Increasing the frequency of 
night-time construction

• 

Extreme cold 
(electrical 
malfunctioning, 
cracking of 
infrastructure, etc.)
Permafrost thaw/
degradation (ground 
destabilization, 
embankment failure, 
etc.)

• 

• 

to enhance albedo
Implementing real-time 
monitoring of road conditions 
(i.e., RWIS)

•  Heating for underground tunnel 

infrastructure (e.g., to prevent 
water main breaks)

Installing crushed rock cooling 
system, or insulation/ground 
refrigeration system

• 

Increasing frequency of rail 
bridge maintenance/inspection
•  Using social media networks to 

•  Using light-coloured pavement 

issue service advisories/ alerts

• 

to enhance albedo
Installing permafrost 
preservation infrastructure, such 
as snow sheds, thermosyphons, 
longitudinal air ducts, side-slope 
snow clearing, etc.

•  Reinforcing embankments 
• 

Installing permafrost 
preservation infrastructure, such 
as snow sheds, thermosyphons, 
longitudinal air ducts, etc. 
•  Clearing side-slopes on rail 

embankments

•  Revising weight/speed limits for 

trains passing over weakened 
areas
Investing in dykes, sea walls or 
flow-management infrastructure

• 

•  Using social media networks 

to issue travel and service 
advisories/alerts

•  Relocating vulnerable roadways 
•  Revising winter road weight/

speed limits

Flooding due to 
changing patterns 
of lake and sea ice/
water levels (ice-jam 
flooding, storm surge, 
sea level rise, etc.)

• 

• 

Investing in dykes, sea walls, or 
flow-management infrastructure
Improving stormwater 
management capacity (e.g., 
widening culverts, shoulders, 
ditches); constructing deeper 
gravel wells underlying road 
beds to improve sub-drainage

•  Using permeable pavements
•  Using social media networks to 

• 

issue travel advisories/alerts
Elevating roadways, sidewalks, 
and bike paths above flood lines 
(or relocating if a recurring issue)
