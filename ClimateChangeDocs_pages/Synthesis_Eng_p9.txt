Projected Changes
Warming will be greatest in winter, and in this season, the largest increases in air temperature are projected for 
northern Canada. In summer, the largest increases are projected for southern Canada and the central interior. The 
magnitude of projected warming varies substantially with the emission scenario
Increases in the frequency and magnitude of unusually warm days and nights and decreases for unusually cold days 
and nights are projected to occur throughout the 21st century
The length, frequency and/or intensity of warm spells, including heat waves, are projected to increase over most 
land areas, including Canada
Rare hot extremes are currently projected to become more frequent. For example, a one-in-20-year extreme hot day 
is projected to become about a one-in-5 year event over most of Canada by mid-century

Precipitation and other hydrological indicators
Seasonal precipitation 

Increases in precipitation are projected for the majority of the country and for all seasons, with the exception of 
parts of southern Canada where a decline in precipitation in summer and fall is suggested
More frequent heavy precipitation events are projected, with an associated increased risk of flooding
Rare extreme precipitation events are currently projected to become about twice as frequent by mid-century over 
most of Canada
Increases in winter streamflow are projected for many regions in southern Canada. Mean annual streamflow is 
projected to decreases in some regions of Alberta and Saskatchewan, while projections for other regions vary across 
different scenarios

Widespread decreases in the duration of snow cover are projected across the Northern Hemisphere with the largest 
changes in maritime mountain regions, such as the west coast of North America
Maximum snow accumulation over northern high latitudes is projected to increase in response to projected 
increases in cold season precipitation

Warming of the permafrost is projected to continue at rates surpassing those observed in records to date. Low 
average temperatures of much of the permafrost in the Arctic mean it will take many decades to centuries for colder 
permafrost to completely thaw

Estimates of the magnitude of future changes in global sea level by the year 2100 range from a few tens of 
centimetres to more than a metre
Projections of global sea-level rise beyond 2100 indicate continuing global sea-level rise over the coming centuries 
and millennia. Global sea-level rise may eventually amount to several metres
Patterns of change along Canadian coastlines will continue to be influenced by land uplift and subsidence as well 
as by changes in the oceans. Sea-level rise will continue to be enhanced in regions where the land is subsiding, and 
sea level is likely to continue to fall in regions where the land is rapidly rising. Regions where the land is slowly rising 
may experience a transition from sea level fall to sea level rise.

A nearly ice-free summer is considered a strong possibility for the Arctic Ocean by the middle of the century 
although summer sea ice may persist longer in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago region

expected to decrease by up to a month by mid-century

SRES scenarios3. In general, the magnitude of the stated changes will increase under higher emission scenarios.
