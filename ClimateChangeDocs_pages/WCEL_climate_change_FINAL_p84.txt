The OCP indicates that council may refer to climate change projections prepared by the 
Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium and others in decision-making, and that bids, tenders 
and contracts for planning and development in the District shall make reference to climate 
change and the Elkford Climate Change Adaptation Strategy;

Establishing a District Growth Boundary that will have multiple community benefits, 
including avoiding additional wildfire risks by limiting further development in wilderness 
areas;

•	 Updating the flood plain designation to reflect current science;

•	 Developing a Parks and Trails Master Plan to implement climate change adaptation 

strategies;

Placing new roads and sidewalks in locations where they can act as fire breaks and access 
routes;

Requiring that stormwater be retained on site in new subdivisions; and

Restricting development in areas subject to natural hazards, including flooding, steep 
slopes and wildfire, through DPAs and other measures.

The Elkford OCP also lists bylaws and other District plans and processes that need to be updated 
and harmonized with the OCP, as well as proposing a number of new actions and studies that would 
assist in implementing the OCP and achieving climate change adaptation goals.

Specific monitoring and evaluation of climate change adaptation in the District is also identified as 
necessary.
