2.5.2.     The Practice
Use Worksheet 2.4 (Identify uncertainties and knowledge gaps) to record any 
uncertainties and knowledge gaps that arise as you work through the vulnerability 
assessment and adaptation planning process. This worksheet can be used as a “parking lot” 
for issues and ideas that could be relevant at later stages in the assessment process.

The point is to record them here for potential use when you are identifying adaptation 
options (chapter 5). At this stage of the process, don’t dwell on these uncertainties; simply 
acknowledge that they exist and move on. Later in the process, you may want to refer 
back to this list as a starting point for developing adaptation options, since increasing 
awareness and addressing knowledge gaps are two possible options for adapting to 
climate change.
