1.2.2.1  Design Basis 

  AEP for Designated Storm: 1/200 for 2010 (Existing Guidelines), 1/500 for 2100 and 2200 

(Updated Guidelines) 

  Tides: Based on CHS Tide Tables, Vol 5, Secondary Port: 7579 Crescent Beach 
  Designated Storm assumed to have storm force winds (≥ 48 knots); depth limited waves at 

toe of dike and peak winds, storm surge and seastate maxima occur simultaneously. 

  Storm Surge during Designated Storm as per Table 3-3, this document. 
  Wave set-up is included in the determination of Wave Runup. 
  Cross section slope and armour details are taken to be the same general type as on the 
existing  dike  except  that  a  1:3  grass  protected  interior  slope  is  implicitly  assumed  to  be 
present to conform with available acceptance criteria for mean overtopping rates, Table 4-
1, this document.

The values in the Table above Designated Flood Level are site specific and those shown are guideline values for 
these examples.  The values in the Table below Designated Flood Level result from the site specific values based

The resulting crest elevations in Table 1-1 show clearly how careful evaluation of the acceptance 
criteria for overtopping volumes of water is critical to the design of a sea dike that can be expected 
to provide the required degree of safety to the community located behind the dike.
