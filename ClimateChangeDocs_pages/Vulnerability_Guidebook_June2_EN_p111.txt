7.4  Worksheets for Chapter 4

The following five worksheets provide guidance on evaluating and documenting 
vulnerability to current climate variability and the future forest impact scenarios 
developed in section 7.3. 

Worksheet 4.1  Assess current and future impacts of SFM

change and perceptions of risk related to climate change

change as adaptation to climate change

Worksheet 4.3  Assess current and future vulnerability

potential future climate

Worksheet 4.1.   Assess current and future impacts on SFM 

The ability to achieve SFM objectives in the future will be affected by expected impacts 
on the forest ecosystem from a changing climate and the sensitivity of the objectives to 
changes in forest ecosystems. Use the forest impacts scenarios and the overall impact 
rankings you created using Worksheet 3.2 (Develop and describe forest impact 
scenarios) as the basis for this worksheet. Populate these tables using the best available 
information (studies, expert judgments, datasets, model outputs, etc.). Note the source 
of information used to make each assessment. Given that the assessment of impacts 
on achieving SFM objectives under various future climates is somewhat subjective, the 
assessment team may not reach consensus on rankings. In that situation, noting the range 
of sensitivity (e.g., moderate to high) is an option.

To start, complete the column in Table 4.1 for impacts of current climate (and climate 
variability) on the ability to achieve SFM objectives. This should help you to become 
familiar with the process of describing how climate affects SFM objectives before 
introducing the added complexity of future climate change scenarios.
