Adaptations for roads, bridges, 
and associated infrastructure 
(including signals, stormwater 

management)

Adaptations for urban rail 
infrastructure and operations

•  Updating zoning by-laws to 

•  Requiring track elevation above 

• 

require low-impact construction 
standards (e.g., permeable 
pavements)
Expanding stormwater 
management capacity (e.g., 
widening culverts, shoulders and 
ditches); constructing deeper 
gravel wells underlying road 
beds to improve sub-drainage

•  Requiring the elevation/

relocation of roadways away 
from flood lines
Sealing street-level vents and 
manholes 

• 

•  Protecting underground pump 

• 

• 

rooms
Installing back-up power sources 
for traffic signals 
Improving drainage and 
maintenance practices 
and materials (e.g., porous/ 
permeable materials)

•  Building dykes or other flood-

management infrastructure

•  Conducting vulnerability 

assessments, updating 
emergency preparedness 
planning and revising floodplain 
mapping

•  Monitoring hydraulic data/

• 

• 

pavement performance metrics 
for pavement performance
Increasing inspection frequency 
for culverts and bridges
Improving salt management 
practices to control snow and 
ice (e.g., using lower-impact 
materials, adjusting the timing 
and mixture of applications 
and/or snow plowing)

•  Considering climate risks during 

• 

infrastructure renewal
Improving real-time monitoring 
of road conditions 

flood-lines

•  Constructing deeper gravel 

wells under rail beds to improve 
permeability and sub-drainage; 
installing pumping systems for 
tunnels 

•  Waterproofing street-level vents, 

circuit breakers, pump houses 
and other underground facilities 
that provide power to subways

•  Conducting vulnerability 

assessments, updating 
emergency preparedness 
planning and revising floodplain 
maps

•  Using advisories and updates 

• 

from transit dispatch centres for 
urban rail users
“Flood-proofing” transit corridors 
(e.g., installing flood sensors on 
locomotives, undertaking culvert 
replacement/upgrades)

• 

• 

Installing back-up power for 
overhead electricity and signals, 
key maintenance and fleet 
facilities
Issuing service change advisories 
in advance of closures/delays 
(i.e., through social media)
