Some of the identified impacts may be cross-cutting, influencing several or all of the SFM 
objectives (e.g., lack of awareness of climate change impacts among senior managers is 
likely to affect many objectives). A separate worksheet (Worksheet 5.2. Develop potential 
adaptation options for the overall SFM system of interest) is provided to develop and 
assess options with a view to reducing cross-cutting impacts on the SFM system.

Changing current policies, practices, and strategies (i.e., adapting) to reduce climate 
change vulnerabilities can focus on many areas of forest management. Two good places 
to start are developing options to address potential impacts on forests and to increase 
adaptive capacity.

A basic approach

Gather a group of interested parties to review the adaptation options listed in Appendix 5 
(the inventory of potential adaptation options) and to brainstorm additional options to add 
to the list. You may also use the knowledge gaps and uncertainties identified throughout 
the vulnerability assessment as a starting point. Engaging with others who are working on 
vulnerability assessment of SFM may also be useful; for example, see the Forestry Adaptation 
Community of Practice <http://www.ccadaptation.ca/facop>. 

A comprehensive 
approach

A more comprehensive approach might include a review of the relevant literature, keeping 
in mind that adaptation is a “local” activity and that adaptations identified in the literature 
may not fit with the specific ecological or institutional context of your assessment area.

Operational 
considerations  

Strategic considerations  

Another approach to eliciting adaptation options is to conduct the first round of a Policy 
Delphi process (see, for example, http://www.climateontario.ca/LakeSimcoeDelphi.php). 

What options exist for adapting forest management policies and practices to reduce 
vulnerability to climate change? When identifying potential adaptation options, keep the 
following guidance in mind

•   Be creative and innovative. Climate change adaptation is a newly expanding area, and not 

all options are on the table yet. 

•   Encourage the identification of new approaches to adaptation by brainstorming. Don’t 

evaluate options at this stage, because doing so can limit creativity.

•   Engage a variety of perspectives in this process, and consider a broad range of potential 

management intensities and viewpoints.

Keep in mind that the ultimate goal of adaptation planning is to reduce vulnerability to 
climate change and thereby increase the likelihood that management objectives will be 
achieved. Because of the profound uncertainties associated with many of the adaptation 
options, it may be important to build flexibility and “learning by doing” into your list of 
adaptation options.
