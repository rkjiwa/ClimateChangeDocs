3.0 OVERVIEW OF BRITISH COLUMBIAâ€™S TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM

The British Columbia transportation system encompasses a variety of different modes, including roads 
and highways, rail, marine, air, and urban transit systems.  The diverse hubs and networks related 
to these various modes act together to provide a cohesive transportation system that supports 
the people and economy of the Province of British Columbia, as illustrated in Figures 6 and 7. The 
alignment of the major transportation corridors and hubs along coastlines and within mountain passes 
and corridors is evident. 

This chapter focuses on roads, rail, marine and air, with urban transit systems discussed in Chapter 9.  
While this chapter discusses each transportation mode individually, it is important to understand that 
they are heavily integrated. Weather impacts that adversely affect one mode of transportation can 
also have negative impacts on other modes.

3.1 ROADS

British Columbia has over 46,000 km of roads, including provincial highways (12,700 km) and side roads 
(33, 300 km) (British Columbia Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure, 2014e; Figure 7), in addition 
to other municipal and federal roads. There are also over 2,800 bridges within the road system (British 
Columbia Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure, 2014e).
