Adapting  
Communities to  
Future Climates

“Adapting for  
climate change 
often brings with 
it surprising extra 
economic, social 
and other  
environmental  
benefits.”
UK Commission for Architecture and 
the Built Environment, 2008

“Integrating climate change 
and sea-level rise into  
infrastructure planning  
improves risk and life-cycle 
cost management, and will  
reduce the vulnerability of 
B.C.’s critical infrastructure.” 

Natural Resources Canada, 2007

Many communities—from electoral areas to villages and 
cities—are thinking about how climate change will affect them 
and are taking steps to prepare and adapt. This section provides 
information on how communities can use urban forests as a tool 
for climate change adaption. 

Urban forests can help communities to adapt to climate change 
in ways that enhance their residents’ quality of life and mitigate 
or solve anticipated problems. For example, planting large-
canopy trees in parking lots provides welcome shade that makes 
summer parking more pleasant. It also reduces air pollution, as 
the leaves absorb airborne particulates and the shade reduces 
toxic off-gassing from hot car engines. As well, asphalt lasts 
longer in shaded areas. These same trees can be part of the 
site’s rainwater management system, while enhancing the 
visual appeal of the built environment. And all of these benefits 
enhance the experience of visitors using this facility to access 
nearby services and businesses, and supports business activity.25 
Planning for multiple benefits such as this is part of good urban 
forest management. 

Below are some suggestions on ways to use urban forests to 
adapt to various impacts from climate change. However, there
