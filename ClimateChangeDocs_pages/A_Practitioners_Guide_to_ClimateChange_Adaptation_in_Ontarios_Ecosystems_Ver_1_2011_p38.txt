A number of methodologies also exist for downscaling global climate model (GCM) outputs for regional and local level 
analyses (refer to the Canadian Climate Change Scenarios Network website for more details).  

An  alternative  to  downscaling  using  statistical  techniques  is  the  use  of  a  Regional  Climate  Model  (RCM)  such  as  the 
Canadian  Regional  Climate  Model,  which  is  available  at  a  resolution  of  approximately  50  x  50  km.  These  numerical 
models are similar to GCMs, but are of higher resolution and may  contain a better representation of, for example, the 
underlying  topography  within  the  model.  In  some  cases,  there  can  also  be  better  representation  of  some  weather 
extremes.  

Despite the improvements in the spatial detail provided by the RCM scenarios, however, there are still limitations to their 
use  (Comer,  2009). The  use  of  regional  models in  generating  climate scenarios  can  be  computationally  demanding  if 
the modelled area is large, since the required spatial resolution is very high and the RCM must run for long time periods 
(i.e.,  greater  than  20  years)  and  is  dependent  on  the  number  of  emission  scenarios.  Overall,  global  model  results  – 
particularly  when  based  on  an  ensemble  of  models  –  are  generally  recognized  as  the  best  available  method  for 
projecting future climate conditions.
