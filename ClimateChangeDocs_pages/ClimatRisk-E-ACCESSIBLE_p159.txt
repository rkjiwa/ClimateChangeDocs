The Seaway is a 3,700-km managed watercourse that became fully navigable in 1959. It operates 
through a series of locks, and contains other valuable infrastructure (including harbours, and 
navigation equipment) that enables direct international trade with the United States, Europe, and 
beyond. Approximately 30,000 tonnes of freight originates in or is destined for Ontario by domestic 
waterways annually (Statistics Canada, 2010).

The Seaway has historically been a critical path for Prairie exporters shipping grain to eastern markets, 
with the most important transcontinental transfer and access point to the Great Lakes system located 
on the north shore of Lake Superior at Thunder Bay (Martin Associates, 2011). Most shipping journeys 
are significant. A typical route for marine freight running from Thunder Bay to the Port of Montreal 
is approximately 1,967 km (102 hours of sailing and 17 hours in the locks) (St. Lawrence Seaway 
Management Corporation, 2014). Important commodities transported through Ontario’s segment of 
the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Seaway include: 

•  Agricultural crops (40 percent), 

•  Mining products (40 percent), 

• 

Iron and steel products (10 percent), and 

•  “Other” goods, including forestry, animal, and petroleum products (10 percent) (Martin 

Associates, 2011).

2.4 AIR TRANSPORTATION

Air travel has been gaining importance and market share for both passenger and cargo movement 
in Ontario. In 2013, 452,000 tonnes of cargo were loaded and unloaded at Ontario’s airports (an 
increase of approximately 5,000 tonnes from 2010), and approximately 45 million passengers passed 
through Ontario terminals (see Figure 2 for principle airports).  Approximately 35 million of these 
boardings and departures occurred at Toronto’s Pearson International Airport, which is Canada’s 
busiest airport (Transport Canada, 2015). Passenger volume in the province has increased by almost 1 
million passengers annually since 2010 (Statistics Canada, 2016). 

An important influence on the evolution of aviation in Ontario was the 1987 deregulation of 
Canada’s air industry and airport divestiture program. As a result, private interests and quasi-public 
authorities are now responsible for the capital and operational demands of air infrastructure in many 
communities (for example, regional airports), although provincial and federal governments continue 
to contribute significantly to airport infrastructure and upkeep (Transport Canada, 2014). This means 
that climate adaptation efforts for air infrastructure will involve many levels of government, with a 
major role for the private sector.
