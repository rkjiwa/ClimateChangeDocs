 

(3)  Estimate the consequences of possible 

outcomes** 
(cid:131)  Estimate the magnitude of the various 
impacts of a risk situation, in the event 
that the risk scenario occurs.  Use 
measurable, verifiable data wherever 
possible.  Again, look for data and 
information in research reports, 
insurance company records or 
information from similar risk situations in 
other regions or countries.   

(cid:131)  As with frequency estimates, a simple 

comparative impact rating system (such 
as a four or five tier scale from “very 
minor effects” to “extremely serious 
effects”) may be useful for making 
relative estimates of various 
consequences from a particular risk 
scenario.  If extensive loss and other 
impact data are available, explicit values 
could be used in a tabular form so that 
the comparative severity can be 
compared.  At this stage, definitive 
measures are not necessary as this is a 
ranking process to determine which risk 
is the most severe and thus should be 
dealt with first. 

(4)  Assess the stakeholders’ perceptions of risk.  

As explained in more detail in Annex 3, 
stakeholder perceptions of the importance to 
them particularly of the consequences of risk 
scenarios is very important and may have a 
very big influence on the ranking of risks. 
(5)  Display the frequency and consequence 
estimates in a tabular or graphical format 
that clearly indicates the relative importance 
of each scenario.   

 

TABLE 3-1: Frequency / Probability Rating 

(cid:131)  Determine how best to present the 

(cid:131) 

frequency and consequence estimates.  
Consider how stakeholders may 
interpret the estimates.  Table 3-1 
shows one way of displaying frequency 
or probability 
It may be helpful to determine the 
expected value of the loss in each of the 
areas that were selected to categorize 
the expected consequences (for 
example, social, economic and 
environmental aspects).  This may help 
in comparing the losses or 
consequences in each risk scenario and 
provide a baseline for later evaluation of 
risk control measures.  Table 3-2 shows 
one way of displaying these.  The 
headings in this table are generic and 
are not intended to be prescriptive.  
Headings could be selected to describe 
local conditions. 

** It may be useful to repeat these tasks 
several times, each time applying different 
information or assumptions about future 
climate or other factors that might influence 
risk.  The frequency and consequence ratings 
for each scenario will vary depend on the 
planning time horizon (that is whether he plan 
is a short-term plan for the next 2 or 3 years 
or a longer term plan covering 10 or 20 
years).  This requires choosing an appropriate 
time frame for a climate scenario and 
vulnerabilities from which the scenario is 
constructed.
