riSk aSSeSSment reSultS:

According to the risk results, all impacts are within the low to medium range, 
with the majority being medium-low and medium risks. no high risk impacts 
were identified given the rating matrix shown in table 11 above. those impacts 
identified as a medium risk included:
•   increased damage to structures (seawalls) and shoreline resulting in  

greater discontinuity of use

•    decrease in durability and lifecycle of infrastructure leading to increased 

maintenance and replacement requirements. this includes changes to 
pavement durability, Civic facilities, signage and traffic signals, underground 
infrastructure, etc.

•   new and existing buildings may be maladapted as the climate changes  

in terms of water ingress, wind durability, rain on snow loads, etc. 

•   increase in shoreline erosion affecting natural environment and public 

•   More frequent and more extreme natural disasters may tax emergency 

amenities such as parks, trails and access to the water

response capacity

•   increase in impacts to urban forests, green spaces and trees from temperature 

extremes and wind storms resulting in increased maintenance and  
replacement costs and changes to aesthetics and use

 

•   increased flooding along the Coast and Fraser river as sea level rises  

and the storm surge and waves breach height of land
