New Brunswick
POPULATION 751,171 (2011 CENSUS)

The province of New Brunswick has approximately 5,500 km of salt-water coastline, which extends from 
the Gaspé Region to the Nova Scotia border and along the Bay of Fundy from The Saint Croix River to the 
Nova Scotia border. There is great diversity in the coastline from the rugged and grassy dunes along the 
Acadian Peninsula and Chaleur Bay to the sandy shores of the Northumberland Strait and the rocky cliffs 
of the Bay of Fundy.32

Nearly 60% of the population lives within 50 kilometres of the coast and there has been significant pressure 
for coastal development in recent years. Between 1990 and 1999, 6,268 new coastal lots were created – an 
average of 627 new coastal properties per year.33 A total of 8 provincial counties and 50 municipal areas 
within them have coastline or areas exposed to the effects of sea level rise. The Gulf of St. Lawrence coast of 
New Brunswick is considered to have the highest sensitivity to sea level rise and associated storm impacts.34

Coastal Areas 
Protection Policy)

The New Brunswick Department of Environment and Local Government produced a Coastal Areas 
Protection Policy for New Brunswick in 2002. The New Brunswick coastal policy is enforced via existing 
provincial legislation such as environmental impact assessment requirements or watercourse alteration 
approvals. These provincial requirements also apply within municipalities, and some municipalities have 
incorporated either elements of or the entire coastal zone policy directly into their bylaws.

Estimates of global sea level rise in conjunction with the best estimates of local vertical motion have 
been used to predict 0.9 to 1.05 metres of total sea level rise over the next century for the coastlines  
of New Brunswick.35
