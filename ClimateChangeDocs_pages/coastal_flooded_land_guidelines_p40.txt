storm surge and wave effects for conditions greater than the “Ordinary Storm”.  An allowance 
of 0.9 m is a reasonable allowance in many situations to allow for a rise in the total water level 
during a severe storm. 

 

 

Figure B2: Coastal Flood Hazard - Interpretation of Existing 2004 Definitions 

 

Figure B3 extends this interpretation of the Existing Definitions to include a specific allowance 
for Sea Level Rise (SLR) and the expected effects during a ‘Designated Storm’ – i.e.: a storm 
that  meets  a  stated  risk  criteria.    These  combined  influences  define  the  total  water  level 
expected at any time in the future for any designated annual exceedence probability (AEP).
