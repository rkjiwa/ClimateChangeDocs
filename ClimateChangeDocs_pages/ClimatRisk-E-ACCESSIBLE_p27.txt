EXAMPLES OF CLIMATE IMPACTS 
ON ROAD TRANSPORT

① Flooding, damage, and wash-outs of 

roads and bridges
 

CLIMATE FACTOR(S)

 • Extreme precipitation (heavy rainfall) and associated 

standing water, landslides, mudslides, ice-jam flooding, 
debris floods

 • Storm surges/sea level rise in coastal areas

② Bridge scour1

 • Extreme precipitation (heavy rainfall, flood-induced erosion)

③ Reduced vehicle traction / stability, 

visibility issues

 • Extreme precipitation
 • Freezing rain
 • High winds (including blowing snow)

④ Damage and deterioration  

of roads 

 • High temperatures (pavement softening, rutting, flushing, 

bleeding)

 • Freeze-thaw cycles (pavement deformation, shearing, 

deterioration)  

 • Warming and thawing of permafrost (ground settlement, 

slope instability, drainage issues, cracking) 

 • Extreme precipitation (weakened embankments, 

⑤ Damage to road structures (including 

signage and traffic signals), 
obstructions (i.e. fallen power lines/
trees), bridge closures

depressions)

 • High winds
 • Extreme precipitation
 • Freezing rain 

⑥ Thermal expansion of bridge joints, 

potentially resulting in “blow ups”

 • High temperatures

⑦ Reduced integrity of winter roads, 

shortened operating season

 • Warming temperatures

Scour refers to the erosion of sediment at the base of bridge piers, abutments and other underwater structures
