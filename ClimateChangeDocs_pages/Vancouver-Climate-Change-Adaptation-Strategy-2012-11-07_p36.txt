aCtion
increase groundwater monitoring to track water table rise and salinity.
evaluate and recommend utility of the greenshores Coastal development 
rating System. 
research and report on beach storm surge education/awareness and/or  
signage (e.g. flag system) 
When pipes are up for replacement in low lying areas consider material  
resilience to corrosion from saltwater.

2.3 reduced gravity drainage capacity of existing drainage system as sea levels rise, resulting in more frequent flooding of low areas near storm sewer outfalls. 
aCtion
Continue to install back-up power to storm pump stations and increase  
system storage. 
identify and prioritize new pump stations in low areas where higher water  
levels will necessitate stormwater pumping.
Add backwater valves on outfalls to prevent saltwater intrusion and backup.
evaluate and recommend whether road closure procedures currently used  
for ice and snow could be applied for flooding.

 -  increased naturalization; greenshores sustainable shoreline development 

approach; rip rap, rock groyne and seawall durability; new armouring, break-
waters, steeper sloped beaches; accept loss and replace in lower risk areas; and 
use excavation materials to reinforce shoreline or stable substrate below sand.
Leverage opportunities to evaluate strategic open space planning for inundation 
and containment areas in near shore greenspaces. 
increase budget for scaling and vegetation management of cliffs.
increase maintenance budget for existing rock groynes and beaches  
(sand import, log debris, dredging).
increase awareness among staff about increasing shoreline erosion and  
appropriate control practices.
