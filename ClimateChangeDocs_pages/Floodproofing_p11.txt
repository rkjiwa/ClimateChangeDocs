the 

considerations 

 
Placing  fill  overtop  of  organic  soils  can  lead  to 
instability.  The  existing  topsoil and subsoil  may 
have  to  be  removed  first  and  replaced  with 
another  material 
(sand,  gravel,  synthetic 
materials  etc.)  to  provide  the  needed  bearing 
capacity.  The  sides  of 
fill  should  be 
protected against erosion, and sloped in such a 
way as to prevent slumping. The fill should not 
extend  onto  adjacent  properties,  so  it  is  also 
important  to  know  the  location  of  property 
boundaries.    Retaining  a  professional  engineer 
and a land surveyor will help ensure that each of 
the  above 
is  adequately 
addressed. 
 
Elevating an existing building on fill may not 
be  feasible  in  locations  where  flood  waters 
flow deep  and  fast  because: a) the  required 
volume and depth of fill will be large; b) the 
fill  may  be  subject  to  erosion  by  flowing 
water;  c)  safe  access  may  not  be  available 
during a flood and d) the fill may block flood 
flow,  leading  to  higher  flood  elevations  on 
adjacent  properties.  Effective  use  of  this 
option 
to 
buildings  located  near  the  edges  of  flood 
hazard  areas.  In  addition,  a  Watercourse  and 
Wetland Alteration Permit is required prior to fill 
such  as 
placement  or  other  activities 
construction, 
land, 
landscaping, etc., within 30 metres (100 feet) of 
a  wetland  or  watercourse.  Those  considering 
fill  placement  in  coastal  areas  should  also 
consult  New  Brunswick’s  Coastal  Areas 
Protection Policy. 
 
The  foundation  of  a  building  raised  on  fill  may 
still be subject to flood damage if the basement 
flood 
floor 
the  anticipated 
elevation.  Flood  water  can  damage 
the 
foundation by exerting pressure on it if the water 
is  able  to  percolate  through  the  fill.  Special 
foundation design and use of anchors to prevent 
buoyancy  may  be  required.    Construction  on  a 
concrete  slab  placed  on  top  of  the  fill  (i.e.  a 
foundation with no basement) may an option.
