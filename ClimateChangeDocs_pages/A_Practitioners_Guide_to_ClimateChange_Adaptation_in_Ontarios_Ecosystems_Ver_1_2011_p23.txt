List  the  themes  to  be  used  in  the  study  area  and  identify  indicators.  For  example,  within  the  theme  of  hydrology,  indicators  could 
include  water  quality,  water  quantity,  and  stream  flow.  Within  a  forest  theme,  indicators  could  include  forest  health,  growth  and 
productivity, disturbance regimes, and forest composition, among others.  

As  a  starting  point,  investigate  the  themes  and  indicators  used  in  other  assessments,  and/or  review  possible  themes  with 
researchers and experts. Ranking of potential themes can assist project teams in deciding which themes are most important to focus 
on, particularly in cases where there are too many themes to pursue given the resources, capacity, or time available.
