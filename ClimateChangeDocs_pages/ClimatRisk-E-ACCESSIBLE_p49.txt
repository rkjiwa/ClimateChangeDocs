These trends in sea-ice cover are expected to 
continue or accelerate (Vaughn et al., 2013), with 
some models projecting almost complete loss of 
summer ice cover before mid-century (Wang and 
Overland, 2012). Arctic sea ice is also thinning, 
with the average spring ice thickness projected 
to decrease from 2.4 m in 2008 (Kwok et al., 2009) 
to 1.4 m by 2050 (Stroeve et al., 2012).
