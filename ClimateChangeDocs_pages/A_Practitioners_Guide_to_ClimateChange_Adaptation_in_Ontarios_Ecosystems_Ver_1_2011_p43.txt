Worksheet 4.3: Estimating Overall Future Vulnerability 

To assign an overall vulnerability ranking, project teams rank each indicator’s future vulnerability High (H), Medium (M), or Low (L), 
based on the collated rankings from Worksheets 4.1 and 4.2.  

 

 

 

 

 High – Impacts are expected to cause widespread and severe-
to-catastrophic damage to ecosystems, and ecosystems will be 
limited in their ability to buffer these impacts. Impacts will disrupt 
important ecosystem functions, alter species distribution and 
abundance,  and lessen their ability to provide key 
environmental benefits.  

 Moderate – Impacts are expected cause substantial damage to 
ecosystems, which may be isolated or widespread. Ecosystems 
will be limited in their ability to buffer these impacts, but some 
reversal of effects may be possible with major effort.  

 Low – Impacts are expected to cause minor changes to 

ecosystems, but these changes can be reversed.  

Because vulnerability is a function of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive 
capacity,  it  is  helpful  to  consider  the  interactions  between  these  three 
components.  Project  teams  may  consider  describing  vulnerabilities 
graphically (see Figure 4 for example) or using other approaches.  

Understanding and Addressing Uncertainty

Framework Manual illustrates one approach to 
depicting vulnerabilities. (Source: Alberta Sustainable 
Resource Development, 2010.) 

 

At  their  core,  vulnerability  assessments  involve  the  synthesis  of  scientific  information,  experiments,  and  modelling  efforts.  In  many 
cases, there will be healthy and lively discussions  about analysts’ confidence in the results of the assessments. As such, the team 
should consider approaches for acknowledging and communicating uncertainty.
