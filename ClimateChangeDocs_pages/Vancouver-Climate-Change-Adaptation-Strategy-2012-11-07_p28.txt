•  Construction safety (high winds)
•   Continue to lobby homeowners protection office for broader acceptance 

of green roofs. 

•   overflow mechanisms in roof design with route plan for flood water and/

or oversize roof drainage system.

•   emergency management plans/evacuation plans for buildings;   

combine flood hazard with seismic. 

•   gray water use and rainwater capture for toilet flushing and garden use.
Supporting actions:
•   incorporate climate change as an asset management and infrastructure 

design consideration.

•   Collaborate with Cascadia region Urban Sustainability directors network 

to investigate asset management approaches to planning for climate 
change.

•   Continue to collaborate with Metro Vancouver on updated intensity  

duration Frequency (idF) curves. 

•   identify training and implementation opportunities within engineering 

with the public infrastructure engineering Vulnerability Committee  
(pieVC - engineers Canada).

Vigour of urBan foreStS, green SPaCeS anD treeS

public and private trees were a focus of the access to nature goal in the 
greenest city plan given the vast array of benefits they provide. growing 
healthy, long lasting trees requires consideration of the future climate as  
well as appropriate siting, planting and maintenance. 
trees contribute to adaptation by:
•   intercepting and filtering stormwater runoff to prevent flooding and  

improve water quality

•   Absorbing pollutants to clean the air
•   providing wind-breaks to protect buildings from damage
•   regulating urban heat island effects through shading and evaporation

Some co-benefits with other goals include:
•   Lower cooling demand for electricity
•  directly sequester carbon
•  Wildlife habitat 
•  increased property value and liveability
