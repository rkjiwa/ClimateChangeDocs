At one Community Open 
House, 90% of participants 
indicated that visualizations 
helped — 29% said they 
helped a little and 61% 
said they helped a lot.

Visualization  tools  increase  community  and  practitioner  awareness  and 
understanding  of  local  climate  change  impacts  and  response  options. The 
BC Ministry of Community, Sport and Cultural Development supported the 
development  of  the  Local  Climate  Change  Visioning  and  Landscape  Visual-
izations: Guidance Manual,  which  offers  material  on  processes  and  the  use 
of tools that will be available (free of charge) to local governments in BC to 
use with existing planning resources including Google Earth, GIS and Com-
munityViz capabilities. The Manual will help to build resilient communities by 
building support for local climate change adaptation and mitigation policies. 
It was developed by the Collaborative for Advanced Landscape Planning at 
University of British Columbia (CALP).

The Manual:

•	 Addresses the visioning process, citizen participation, participatory 
scenario building, data and modelling and final visioning packages;

•	 Provides a platform for discussing and evaluating adaptation and 

mitigation options;

•	 Shows how visualizations can enhance the communication of and 

engagement with complex and future-oriented information within a 
local setting: people may for the first time ”see” future climate change 
in their own backyards, and better understand their choices; and

•	 Was based on use of the model in a number of communities and 
on a variety of climate change impacts including: snow pack melt/
snow line projections (District of North Vancouver), sea level rise/ 
flood adaptation (Delta), wildfire events (Kimberley) and FireSmart 
actions, multiple events (tree blow down, pests and diseases) and 
biomass production potential (Prince George). See the Executive
