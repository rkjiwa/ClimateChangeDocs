Vulnerability

“The degree to which 
a system is susceptible 
to, and unable to cope 
with, adverse effects of 
climate change, including 
climate variability and 
extremes. Vulnerability is a 
function of the character, 
magnitude, and rate 
of climate change and 
variation to which a system 
is exposed, its sensitivity, 
and its adaptive capacity.” 

—(Parry et al. 2007) 

Worksheet 1.1 (Define the problem or challenge) guides you in preparing the 
statements of purpose and expected outcome after identification of the factors that have 
triggered the assessment and exploration of the anticipated benefits of a vulnerability 
assessment or the potential consequences of not doing so.

Bring together your colleagues to brainstorm and complete Worksheet 1.1 (Define the 
problem or challenge). If possible, include one key decision maker. 

Invite representatives from all departments in your organization, as well as from other 
organizations and agencies with SFM roles for your area. Work together to explore possible 
triggers and affected decisions and decision-makers, keeping an open mind to the diversity 
of views. Try to avoid seeking consensus at this stage and instead simply record the diversity 
of views, as this reflects the reality that you will likely encounter during the assessment. 

Be mindful of the possible implications of triggers on operational factors such as length of 
the harvest season or the need for unexpected salvage harvesting. Consider which decisions 
are actually made by operations personnel, including contractors and forest workers.

At the strategic scale, challenges related to climate change can affect several decisions. 
For example, an increase in the area burned by wildfires can necessitate increased salvage 
harvesting, change reforestation success, shift timber supply, and alter wildlife habitats, all of 
which may affect strategic decisions. 

1.3  Define the SFM System of Interest  

1.3.1     The Theory
The concept of vulnerability (see sidebar Vulnerability) that has been adopted in the 
assessment framework (Williamson et al. 2012) focuses on a defined climate-sensitive 
“system.” SFM is carried out through a complex, integrated socioecological system, with 
elements that are more or less sensitive to climate. 

Defining the SFM system of interest entails choosing and describing an appropriate 
geographic (spatial) scale for the vulnerability assessment, listing the actors (i.e., those 
involved in making decisions and those affected by the decisions), and describing the 
larger decision-making context (e.g., policies and regulations) within which the system 
resides. Clearly defining the SFM system of interest early in the vulnerability assessment 
and adaptation process can help reduce barriers to adaptation later on (Moser and 
Ekstrom 2010). 

Canadian SFM systems encompass a defined land area and include two types of elements: 

 

 

•  natural biophysical elements (e.g., ecosystems, forest types, streams, wildlife)

•   human elements (e.g., individuals and organizations, institutions, built infrastructure 

such as roads).

The SFM system also includes management objectives, which define the outcomes 
desired from the system, and indicators used to measure achievement of these objectives. 
Climate change is likely only one of several factors influencing the SFM system. Other key
