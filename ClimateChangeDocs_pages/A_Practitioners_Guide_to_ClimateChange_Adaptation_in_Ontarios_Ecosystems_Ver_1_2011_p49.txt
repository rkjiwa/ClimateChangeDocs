STEP 5: 

 

 
DEVELOP ADAPTATION OPTIONS 

 

 

 
 
 
 
 

Step 5 identifies potential adaptation options to help practitioners 
reduce or eliminate vulnerabilities and risks. Measures can seek 
to  reduce  sensitivity  and  exposure  or  to  enhance  adaptive 
capacity.  As  part  of  the  process,  adaptation  options  can  be 
assessed 
feasibility,  practicality,  and  other 
consideration  that  meet  the  unique  needs  of  their  organization. 
Ultimately,  practitioners  select  and  prioritize  a  suite  of  options 
that will be implemented.

Identifying Adaptation Options 

Climate  change  adaptation  options  come  in  all  forms,  shapes, 
and  sizes,  and  are  specific to  the  study  area.  Likewise,  there  is 
no  single  ‘correct’  procedure  or  process  for  generating  adaptive 
responses to the identified climate vulnerabilities and risks. Each 
method  of  developing  adaptive  responses  has  strengths  and, 
consequently,  each  method’s  utility  depends  on  resources,  the 
specific adaptation process, and the stakeholders involved.  

Generally  speaking,  options  can 
include  broad  strategies, 
regional  approaches,  and  site-specific management  actions  and 
tactics  that seek to (1) reduce threats; (2) enhance resilience of 
species  and  systems;  (3)  engage  people;  and  (4)  improve 
knowledge.  Because  of  the  uncertainties  associated  with  some 
adaptation  options,  it  is  also  important  to  build  flexibility  and 
‘learning-by-doing’ into the measures.
