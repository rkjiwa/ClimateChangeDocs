If you are facing imminent flooding, move electrical appliances to upper 
floors and make sure to anchor fuel supplies, such as oil tanks. Tune in 
to local radio and TV channels for information on sandbagging stations, 
possible evacuation procedures and reception centres.

Never attempt to drive or walk in flood water. A mere six inches of fast-
moving water can knock over an adult. Two feet of rushing water can 
carry away most vehicles, including SUVs and pick-up trucks.

If directed to evacuate 

  Gather your grab-and-go kit(s).

  Follow instructions from local officials via TV, radio or social 

media.

  Move to a safe location outside the impacted area.

  Return home only when authorities say it is safe to do so.
