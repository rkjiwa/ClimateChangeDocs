GUIDEBOOK FOR ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE  STEP  1

CASE STUDY 3

Ice Monitoring Program, Northern Quebec 

Focus, objectives and team in the SAM project: In 2004, the Kativik Regional Government, in conjunction with the
University of Laval, the Ouranos Consortium and local researchers, launched an integrated community-based ice monitoring
program to “contribute to local population’s abilities to cope with climatic change and maintain traditional harvesting activities”
in the region.  

The program combines Traditional Knowledge (TK), local observations, and scientific methods to develop a more accurate
understanding of sea ice experiencing climate change. Scientific ice monitoring data is collected on an ongoing basis to record local
ice conditions.   

Responses to climate change and their implementation: The short-term, local adaptation is the production of weekly
maps that illustrate principal and alternate trails as well as ‘risky areas’ around each of the participating communities. This
information is distributed to the public through a website published in English, French, and Inuktitut. Long-term goals of the
program include the identification of ice safety indicators that can help model ice behaviour in climate change conditions. Local
researchers have received monitoring training, with the intention that monitoring activities will progressively be adopted by
community members.
