winter temperature, precipitation and snow cover. 
The analysis reveals that selecting 12 simulations 
out of a possible 86 allows a good representation 
of the range. 

Moreover,  some  input  from  users  and  climate 
service providers can help the selection process in 
some cases37. For example, some planning exercises 
may warrant the need to focus on evaluating worst 
case scenarios (which could imply only considering 

models run with RCP 8.5).  A method that is often 
adopted by users is to select a «low», «median» 
and  «high»  climate  change  scenario  that  will 
adequately cover the range of all the simulations 
that are available. Figure 10 highlights an example 
of  this  technique,  where  the  temperature  and 
precipitation  outputs  are  used  to  select  the 
scenarios that are closest to the 10th, 50th and 90th 
percentile changes out of the available simulations.

Figure  10  |    Projected  change  in  mean  summer  temperature  (June,  July  and  August)  and  mean  winter  
temperature (December, January and February). The changes are shown for an ensemble of GCMs 
 
under three RCPs (2.6, 4.5 and 8.5). The elliptical lines indicate the 10th, 50th and 90th percent confidence  
 
intervals. The scenarios close to the 10th, 50th and 90th percentile changes are circled in blue and  
 
highlighted with blue arrows.

Limitations of selection 

An important point to remember is that selections of a few representative simulations out of a range 
of available outputs are invariably based on a limited number of climate indices over a given temporal 
window (annual temperature and precipitation for example). They may therefore not be representative 
of other indices over different temporal timescales (monthly snow cover for example). In other words, 
the selection is only valid for the indices and timescales that were used to choose the scenarios in the 
first place.
