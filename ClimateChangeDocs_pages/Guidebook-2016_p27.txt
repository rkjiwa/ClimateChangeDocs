*Note that SRES A1F1 was not used in the CMIP3 experiment and therefore does not appear on Figure 5 below. 
However, if it was shown, it would appear above SRES A2.

Figure  5  |    Global  temperature  change  relative  to  1986-2005  for  the  SRES  scenarios  run  by  CMIP3  and  the  RCP  
scenarios  runby  Coupled  Model  Intercomparison  Project  (CMIP5,  see  section  1.6.1).  The  number  of  
 
models is given in brackets and the shading (coloured envelopes) represents all model results.
