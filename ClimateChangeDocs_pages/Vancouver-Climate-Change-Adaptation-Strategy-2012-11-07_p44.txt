impact Statement
increased surface water flooding from ponding of rainfall in low lying areas or heavy rainfall 
overcoming the capacity of drainage system 
increase in number of combined sewer overflows
increased building roof/skylight leakage and collapse with more extreme events such as  
rain on snow
increased water ingress, mould occurrences and storm related damage to temporary or low 
cost buildings resulting in secondary impacts to health and potentially increasing homelessness
increase in delays of construction and damaged/rotting construction material.
increases in private property sewer back-ups in combined sewer areas due to high rainfall 
volume in sewer system. Secondary impacts to health, insurability of citizens and City  
reputation and service excellence
increased safety and health risks for vulnerable populations including those in lower quality 
housing, homeless population and seniors
reduced revenue due to decrease in attendance at winter/spring/fall outdoor cultural events, 
especially day-of event ticket sales
increase in landslide risk affecting public infrastructure and private property
Higher cost or lower standard associated with snow clearing in the near term with potentially 
large snowfalls
increase in worker health and safety needs and occupational health costs due to heavy  
rainfall, ice events, and generally poor weather working conditions
decrease in outdoor worker productivity 
increased maintenance costs and shorter lifecycle of civic facilities from weathering and 
heavier use of mechanical systems 
decreased comfort spending time in the public realm
increased maintenance costs and decrease in use of playing fields
new and existing buildings may be maladapted as the climate changes in terms of water 
ingress, wind durability, rain on snow loads, etc. 
Construction practices may be maladapted to changing climate with resulting risks to public 
safety and loss of assets
increased volume of third party liability claims against the city from major rain events,  
financial loss where City negligent, damage to City owned properties, reputational damage 
from the perspective of the public
increased costs for response actions and clean-up after heavy rain events
