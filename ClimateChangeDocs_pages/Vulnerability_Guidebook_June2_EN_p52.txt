Strategic considerations  

Several technical aspects should be considered in the creation of forest impact scenarios. 
The amount of scientific analysis and modeling required will often depend on how 
much information (data) exists for the SFM area of interest, the availability of resources to 
model forest ecosystems and their responses to changes in climate, and the degree of 
“evidence” required for making decisions. Keep in mind that scenarios are not predictions, 
but possible futures; therefore, possible future forest impact scenarios can be developed 
simply through discussion with colleagues, detailed models, or a combination of the two. 

The forest impact scenarios developed here will be used in the next step of the 
assessment to assess the consequences of these impacts on the ability to achieve SFM 
objectives.

Use the practitioner and local knowledge existing within your assessment team to describe 
a range of possible forest impact scenarios based on the climate scenarios developed in 
chapter 2. The scenarios you choose should be relevant to your local or regional area. The 
idea is not to be predictive in your estimates of change but rather to describe a range of 
possible futures. 

A more comprehensive approach would be to include on the vulnerability assessment team 
a number of forest resource and modeling experts who can examine a range of potential 
climate change impacts on the forests within the SFM area of interest and beyond. The 
use of multiple forest impact models combined with tacit or expert knowledge is a useful 
method for exploring potential future forest conditions.

The impacts of climate change on forests may have implications for forestry operations. 
Such implications may include reduced access to forest resources (e.g., shorter winter 
road conditions), increased salvage operations, reduced timber or fiber quality for mills, or 
reduced tree-regeneration success. Consider forest planning, harvesting, and regeneration 
practices when developing forest impact scenarios.

Keep in mind that no model or expert can accurately predict the future climate and forest 
conditions in that climate. Exploring a range of possible futures is a method for developing 
management options that are robust across a range of future forest conditions. Changes 
to forests and forest conditions in the future may present new opportunities for the SFM 
system of interest. It is therefore important to consider potential positive impacts of climate 
change as well.
