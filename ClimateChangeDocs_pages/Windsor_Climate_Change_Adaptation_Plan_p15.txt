Climate Change Adaptation Plan  2012 

 
What Windsor is Already Doing 

The City of Windsor has already instituted a number of programs that increase the resiliency to potential 
climate change impacts (Figure 12).  Several of these programs were instituted or expanded following 
significant events identified in the previous section.  For example, the downspout disconnection 
program was expanded following the intense rainfall events of 2006, 2007, while the basement flooding 
program was initiated after the 2010 intense rainfall event.
