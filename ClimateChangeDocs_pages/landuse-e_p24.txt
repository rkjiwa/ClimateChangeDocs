Heat and health vulnerability assessment in Windsor, Ontario
Windsor (population 210 891) is Canadaâ€™s most southerly city and has summertime temperatures that are among 
the highest in Canada.61 Climate change is expected to significantly increase the number of extreme heat days 
annually in the region. This may exacerbate the risk of heat-related illness and deaths, particularly among seniors, 
the chronically ill and other vulnerable groups. 
Windsor was one of four pilot communities in a Health Canada project to develop community-based Heat Alert 
and Response Systems (HARSs) to alert local residents when extreme temperatures pose a serious health concern 
and to activate a coordinated public health response. The City of Windsor and Health Canada collaborated to 
conduct a heat-health vulnerability assessment to help strengthen the design of the HARS as well as to engage 
important stakeholders. The vulnerability assessment proceeded in five steps:62 (1) an initial assessment of the 
scope, objectives, work plan and stakeholders involved; (2) the collection and analysis of data, including an 
examination of the relationship between temperature and mortality; (3) the projection of future climate for the 
Windsor region; (4) a literature review to provide background information about the impacts of heat on health, 
vulnerability assessment methods, and best adaptation practices; and (5) workshops to consult with stakeholders 
and the community about existing vulnerabilities, adaptive capacity and potential adaptation actions. The 
vulnerability assessment provided information that allowed public health officials to develop more effective 
adaptation interventions.63
