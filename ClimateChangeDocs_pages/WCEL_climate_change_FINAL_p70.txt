liquid wAste mAnAgement PlAns

According to the Environmental Management Act, s.24, local governments may prepare 
liquid waste management plans for their jurisdictions.

Liquid waste management plans (LWMPs) can establish long term, integrated strategies 
for rainwater management and the protection of natural watercourses, which will help 
make communities more resilient to the impacts of climate change on water supply and 
precipitation events. LWMPs are an excellent opportunity to provide the framework for 
developing  green  infrastructure.  Green  infrastructure  solutions  generally  have  lower 
maintenance and operational costs, and can also offer greater flexibility compared to 
conventional infrastructure (such as pipes and drains) in the face of uncertainty about 
the  amount  of  change  that  infrastructure  will  need  to  accommodate  as  a  result  of  a 
changing climate.

Examples:

•	

The District of Sooke recently completed the final phase of developing a 
liquid waste management plan and became the first community in BC to 
integrate sanitary and rainwater management plans. www.sooke.ca/EN/main/

•	 Metro Vancouver’s new Integrated Liquid Waste and Resource Management 

Plan includes measures aimed at helping address the impacts of climate change 
and climatic variability on local water resources, and designing and adapting 
infrastructure to address climate change risks. www.metrovancouver.org/about/

To consider:

•	

Climate change may have important consequences for liquid waste 
management plans, which may need to be updated in light of projected 
climate change impacts affecting water supply, precipitation and sea level 
rise, depending on the region. New plans should also take into account these 
impacts.

Green infrastructure 
solutions generally 
have lower 
maintenance and 
operational costs, and 
can also offer greater 
flexibility compared 
to conventional 
infrastructure (such 
as pipes and drains).
