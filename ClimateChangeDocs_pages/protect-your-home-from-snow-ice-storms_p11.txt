왘 Paying attention to local weather forecasts that predict extreme cold

weather. Opening your taps to allow a drip of water to keep water
moving. This is really important for pipes in exterior walls that are
more exposed to cooler temperatures. 

왘 Maintaining a consistent thermostat temperature during the day and

at night. Turning down the thermostat at night, for example, can
expose some pipes to extremely low temperatures.

왘 Pipes under sinks or appliances are usually not insulated, so opening
kitchen and sink cabinets can open access to warmer air circulating
throughout the house.

왘 Keep the garage door closed. Sometimes water pipes can run

through the garage if it is attached to the home. An open door can
expose these pipes to extremely low temperatures.

If you are leaving your home for any extended period of time during
the winter, homeowners can help prevent frozen pipes upon their
return in a number of ways. 
왘 Make sure the thermostat is set no lower than

12C (54F). 

왘 Ask a neighbour to check on the house at

least every other day to make sure the
temperature is not too low. 

왘 Before you leave, drain your water system.

It is important that during cold snaps
that the temperature is not set any
lower than 12 Celcius.

Power outages are one of the more common
causes of frozen pipes. Without power, the
water supply may also shut off. If you do not
"ush water out of the pipes it can easily freeze. During the 1998
Montreal Ice Storm, for example, power outages led to signi!cant
damage in many homes from frozen pipes.
왘 If water is no longer coming into your home, turn off the main
water valve coming into your home. Open all taps to clear the
remaining water in the pipes.

왘Homeowners should ensure that they can access a back-up power

supply, such as a stand-by generator.
