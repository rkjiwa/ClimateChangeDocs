 

and  their  associated  ecosystems  are  at  risk  of  being  ‘squeezed  out’4.    SLR  Planning  should 
consider what areas of land should be set aside to allow migration of coastal ecosystems, or to 
support ecosystem restoration or habitat banking.  
SLR  Planning  Areas,  or  applicant  supported  studies  by  Qualified  Professionals,  should  also  be 
used to customize building “setback” based on coastal risk assessments that consider how SLR 
combined with wave action and coastal geomorphology may alter shoreline locations, shape and 
backshore erosion. Guidelines for location of buildings should be based on these planning studies 
and the expected life of the at-risk asset. 
Salinization  of  surface  freshwater  and  groundwater  may  also  increase  in  shoreline  areas, 
potentially affecting both ecosystems and drinking water supplies from coastal wells. SLR Planning 
should  consider  how  to  mitigate  the  impacts  of  salinization.  Drainage  may  also  be  impeded  by 
higher groundwater levels. 
Land managers may decide to PROTECT some parts of a SLR Planning Area by building a new 
dike or placing landfill to meet FCLs. If dikes are used as protection, such areas must meet the 
requirements of the “Sea Dike Guidelines 2010”.
