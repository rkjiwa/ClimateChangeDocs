After a flood

What to do first
• Report your flood by dialing 311 or 905-615-4311 if outside  

city limits. 

• Call your insurance company as soon as possible. Report any 
damage caused by the flooding. They will also advise you on 
how to proceed.

• Call in professionals such as a damage restoration company  

to have the area cleaned properly.

• Where possible, take measures to dry your home quickly  

to prevent further damage and mould growth. Use fans  
and dehumidifiers.

Initial safety precautions 
Flooding can affect your safety and your health.  
Take precautions to prevent illness and injury.
• If you had to evacuate your home, stay tuned to your  

local radio or television station or dial 311 or 905-615-4311  
if outside city limits to find out when it is safe to return home. 
You can also visit mississauga.ca for updates. 

• You will be notified if the municipal drinking water  

is unsafe to drink.

• Don’t drive or walk through floodwaters.
• Stay away from downed powerlines.
• Assume that everything touched by floodwaters  

is contaminated.

• Keep children and pets away from flooded areas  

and contaminated items.

• When you do return home, go with someone else  

and carry a cell phone.

Before re-entering your home after a flood
• Check for foundation and structural damage. Check that all 

porch roofs and overhangs are supported.

• If you are unsure about the safety of your home, do not  

go inside. Contact a qualified home inspector or structural 
engineer for advice. 

• Do not attempt to reconnect the electricity, natural gas, 

telephone or TV cable yourself. Call your service provider  
for assistance.
