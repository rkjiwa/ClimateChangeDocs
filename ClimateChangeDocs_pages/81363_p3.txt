An Overview of
getting to Carbon neutral: a guide for Canadian muniCipalities

Using  readily  available,  proven  and  affordable  technologies, 
Canadian municipalities could cut their greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions  by  70  per  cent  or  even  more.  Getting  to  Carbon 
Neutral:  A  Guide  for  Canadian  Municipalities,  commissioned 
by  Toronto  and  Region  Conservation  (TRCA),  demonstrates 
how communities around the world are tackling the root cause 
of climate change. More importantly, it shows how Canadian 
municipalities can do it too.

The detailed guide, developed by the Sustainable Infrastructure 
Group  in  the  University  of  Toronto’s  Department  of  Civil 
Engineering, analyzes a suite of 22 technical options and urban 
planning  policies  that  can  be  used  to  substantially  reduce  a 
municipality’s  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emissions.  Canadian 
examples  include  Calgary’s  wind-powered  C-train,  Toronto’s 
deep lake water cooling project, and a bike-to-work initiative in 
Whitehorse. International experiences are captured as well in 
case studies exploring projects such as passive building design 

in Austria or a process for detecting and repairing leaks in Tokyo’s water distribution system.

Getting to Carbon Neutral also provides:

 ›

Guidelines  for  estimating  the  GHG  emission  reductions  that  can  be  achieved  by 
each of the technologies or policies 

 › More  than  70  case  studies  that  illustrate  the  best  practices  in  sustainable  urban 

design and planning in action worldwide

Examples of how these options can be utilized to develop a comprehensive strategy 
to reduce a municipality’s GHG emissions 

Examples of methods to overcome barriers to implementation

About 1.6 million tonnes of methane gas is captured by the City of Toronto’s landfill gas collection system each year 
and used to generate enough electricity to power roughly 24,000 homes. By reducing the demand for coal-powered 
electricity, the project offsets the release of 135,000 tonnes of CO2e annually.
