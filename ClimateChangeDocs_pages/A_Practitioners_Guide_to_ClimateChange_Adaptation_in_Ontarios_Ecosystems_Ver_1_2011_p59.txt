Lake Simcoe Climate Change Vulnerability Assessments 

The  project  team  engaged  scientists  and  practitioners  to  complete  preliminary  vulnerability  assessments  for  11  themes  and 
established a forum of climate change experts to generate adaptation options for addressing the known and potential vulnerabilities 
of natural assets and infrastructure to climate change described by the scientists. The environmental themes included:  

 

 

 Hydrology;  
 Aquatic habitat; 
 Wildlife; 
 Insects; 
 Species-at-risk;  
 Invasive species;  
 Vegetation cover;  
 Natural heritage areas;  
 Agriculture;  
 Tourism and recreation; and  
 Infrastructure.

Protection Act study area (Source: Douglas et al., 2011). 
 

Scientists completed assessments by examining indicators to assess vulnerabilities based on future climate projections (see Figure 
5). Indicators were chosen that were most appropriate for the theme being examined, such as  impacts of warmer temperatures on 
riparian vegetation, coldwater fish habitat, wetland water levels, tourism activities (e.g., skiing, snowmobiling, and ice fishing), and the 
composition of tree species in the forest. Each team of scientists prepared a background discussion paper describing methods  and 
results.  In  addition,  they  provided  a  list  of  three  primary  consequences  of  climate  change  for  their  theme  or  sector;  these  were 
communicated to the forum of climate change experts at a workshop (refer to Step 5, above).
