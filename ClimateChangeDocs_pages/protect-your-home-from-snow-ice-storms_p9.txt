Also, make sure underlayment is installed in roof valleys where snow
and ice can collect during the winter. 

There are also a series of less costly steps a homeowner can take if ice
dams are a continuing problem.
Increasing the insulation above your
ceilings can help prevent heat from
escaping into your attic or through
your roof. For suspended ceilings,
!bre glass batt insulation can be
installed to prevent heat loss. For
drywall ceilings that are nailed
directly to the joists, blown insulation
in addition to !bre glass insulation
can be effective. 

Roof maintenance is also a key
measure homeowners can take to
prevent ice dams. It is important to
make sure that roof drainage
systems, such as scuppers, gutters
and down spouts are free of debris
and working properly. Blockages can
prevent water from draining.
Overhanging trees or vegetation
should be cut back to prevent debris
from landing on your roof and
clogging these drains. 

For some homes, especially those
with aging drainage systems that are
surrounded by trees, this type of
preventative maintenance may still
not stop ice dams. In this case, a
heating cable installed on the gutter
or downspout may be necessary. 

Fibre glass insulation can signi!cantly reduce
heat loss from your home.

Blocked gutters can stop water from draining
from your roof and cause ice dams.
