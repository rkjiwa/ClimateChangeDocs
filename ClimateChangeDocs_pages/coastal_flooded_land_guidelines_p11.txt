Level (FCL) 

1 Estimate based on Recommended Sea Level Rise in Figure 3-1 and an uplift rate of 1.2 mm/yr for Victoria 
2 Varies by site and location in BC, as defined in Tide Tables, Volume 5, CHS for Victoria 
3 Recommended value for a 1/500 yr AEP based on “Policy Discussion Paper 20101” and assuming the Total 
Storm Surge equals the Storm Surge in deepwater.  
4 Based on wave runup on natural gravel – pebble beach shoreline. 
5Assumes no Flood Proofing. 
6 Potential SLR levels at the High range of projections from scientific authorities.
