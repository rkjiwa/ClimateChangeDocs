2.0 Land use planning tools

This section describes seven of the most prominent land 
use planning tools in use across Canada and explains how 
communities can use them to more effectively adapt to 
climate change. 

Land use planning refers to the processes and instruments 
employed to manage the use of land and the physical 
development of a community for the common interest. 

A variety of statutory and other measures – bylaws, 
incentives, information and guidance, spending programs – 
may be applied to control how land is used. The scale of 
action is usually the neighbourhood, a whole town or city 
or a metropolitan area. Tools for the regulation of individual 
buildings, such as building codes, green building standards, 
property taxes and the like, are closely related to land use 
planning but are not covered in this document.
