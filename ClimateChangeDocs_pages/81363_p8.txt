Technological and Policy Options

Energy Supply

Municipalities have a wide array of 
options for reducing the carbon footprint 
of their energy supplies. To approach 
carbon neutrality, greater investments 
in renewable energy technology 
will be needed. On a community or 
neighbourhood scale they can promote 
and facilitate the development of 
more efficient district heating and 
cooling, underground thermal storage, 
cogeneration, and combined heat and 
power systems. The same strategic land 
use planning principles that reduce 
transportation emissions – density, 
diversity and site design – resonate in 
planning low-carbon community energy 
systems.

9.  Develop electricity from renewable 

sources, including wind, solar 
radiation, tides, waves, and 
geothermal.

10.  Promote underground thermal 

energy storage that uses aquifers 
or boreholes.

11.  Promote highly efficient district 

heating and cooling systems 
that directly service a group of 
buildings through a network  
of piping.

12.  Promote co-generation or 

combined heat and power systems 
that recover waste heat and 
improve system efficiencies.

13.  Promote integrated community 
energy systems that provide an 
economy of scale for infrastructure 
investment and resource recovery.

The City of Whitehorse’s “Wheel 2 Work” campaign offers prizes to encourage bicycle use by commuters during the 
summer months. In 2006, the program attracted 210 participants who logged about 40,000 km and cut their GHG 
emissions by an estimated 4.5 tonnes.
