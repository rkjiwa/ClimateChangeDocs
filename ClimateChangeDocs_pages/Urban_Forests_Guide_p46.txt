Get to Know your Urban Forests 

•	 Conduct an inventory of your urban forest—simple or in-

climate in your area. Where are areas of greatest risk? What 
are the priorities for action? 

Decide What Type of Adaptation is Most Important to Your 
Community 

•	 Find out what the expected effects of climate change are 
for your community. What is the most important function 
that trees and shrubs can do—slope stabilization? shading? 
rainwater infiltration?—and look at how you can enhance 
these benefits.
