expanded to include a much broader spectrum of players. The need for climate specialists is outlined in Principle # 4. However,
the impacts of climate change can be far reaching and outside of the scope of an engineer’s normal practice. To accommodate
this reality, the professional should structure project teams to ensure that, as a minimum, the team possesses:

»

Fundamental understanding of risk and risk assessment processes;

»

Directly relevant engineering knowledge of the system;

»

Climatic and meteorological expertise/knowledge relevant to the region;

»

Expertise in natural sciences such as hydrology, geology, forestry, biology and other specialized sciences;

»

Hands-on operation and maintenance experience with the system or similar systems;

»

Hands-on management knowledge with the system or similar systems;

»

»

Local knowledge and history, especially regarding the nature of previous climatic events, their overall impact in the
region and approaches used to address concerns; and

High awareness of levels of process or design “minimum acceptable performance” for the community and stakeholders
reliant on the design.

Additionally, the professional should also consider adding skills for the team in:

»

Social impact analysis (social scientists and policy specialists);

»

Environmental impact analysis;

»

Economic impact analysis;

»

Political decision makers;

»

Insurance specialists;

»

Environmental practitioners;

»

Community stakeholders;

»

Emergency planning and response specialists; and

»

Other stakeholders as appropriate. This may include members of the public or at the political level e.g. city councillor.

Skill sets may include those supporting climate change mitigation – to achieve energy efficiency, use of renewable energy,
carbon reduction or reducing resource consumption to minimize GHG emissions.  For mitigation opportunities the GHG
emissions can be modelled and various alternative reduction options can be evaluated.  Mitigation modelling should consider
potential operational changes that would accrue with climate change and therefore affect future emissions. 

For most infrastructure projects the opportunities for mitigation, adaptation and resilience are likely to be interrelated.  It is
important therefore that the team include these objectives as part of their project constraint management.

Practitioners may possess more than one of the requisite skill sets. Thus, teams may comprise a smaller number of individuals
than the skills list may suggest. Engineers should evaluate the skills represented on their teams to ensure that the right balance
of skill and experience is represented to reasonably anticipate climate change and incorporate reasonable adaptive measures
into the project.

Where professionals do not have the skills outlined above, they should consult with other qualified professionals to augment the
team’s expertise, as they would normally do when they encounter issues outside of their professional scope of practice.

3.7.2 Implementing actions

The following actions can help engineers secure the requisite range of skills and expertise that are needed to identify potential
climate risks and impacts as well as to develop acceptable adaptation solutions. Not all may be needed or appropriate as skill set
needs depend on the situation at hand and the stakeholders that need to be involved.

The engineer is encouraged to give thought to and implement other actions or engage other stakeholders and expertise not listed
in this guideline. These should be reported to their regulator and Engineers Canada. These will be incorporated into the next
edition of this guideline.

»

During the formation of multi-disciplinary teams, review the overall service life and operability requirements of the
engineered system and ensure that the entire range of skills necessary to assess climate implications of the work are
covered.

»

In working papers and files maintain a written record of the team membership, skill sets, and training of each member
of the multi-disciplinary team relative to the project/assignment.
