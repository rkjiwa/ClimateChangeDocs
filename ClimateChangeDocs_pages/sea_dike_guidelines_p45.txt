1.3.2.1  Design Basis 

  AEP for Designated Storm: 1/200 for 2010 (Existing Guidelines), 1/500 for 2100 and 2200 

(Updated Guidelines) 

  Tides: Based on CHS Tide Tables, Vol 5, Secondary Port: 7594 Sand Heads 
  Designated Storm assumed to have storm force winds (≥ 48 knots); depth limited waves at 

toe of dike and peak winds, storm surge and seastate maxima occur simultaneously. 

  Storm Surge during Designated Storm as per Table 3-3, this document. 
  Wave set-up is included in the determination of Wave Runup. 
  Cross section slope and armour details are taken to be the same general type as on the 
existing  dike  except  that  a  1:3  grass  protected  interior  slope  is  implicitly  assumed  to 
conform  with  available  acceptance  criteria  for  mean  overtopping  rates,  Table  4-1,  this 
document. 

  The mean overtopping rate criteria in Table 4-1 are assumed to apply for a seaward slope 

of 1:5.
