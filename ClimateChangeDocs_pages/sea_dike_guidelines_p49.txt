1.4.1.1  Design Basis 

  AEP for Designated Storm: 1/200 for 2010 (Existing Guidelines), 1/500 for 2100 and 2200 

(Updated Guidelines) 

  Tides: Based on CHS Tide Tables, Vol 5, Secondary Port: 7710 False Creek 
  Designated Storm assumed to have storm force winds (≥ 48 knots); the maximum seastate 
present  at  the  wall  is  taken  to  be  0.6  m  and  storm  surge  and  seastate  maxima  occur 
simultaneously. 

  Storm Surge during Designated Storm as per Table 3-3, this document. 
  Wave set-up is included in the determination of Wave Runup. 
  A  near  vertical  seawall  was  adopted  for  the  sea  dike  in  this  example  due  to  the  close 
proximity of highly used public buildings near  the edge of the existing island slope.  For 
simplicity, the presence of the overhanging timber deck platforms was not considered. 

  The mean overtopping rate criteria in Table 4-2 are assumed to apply for a seaward slope 

consisting of a vertical seawall located at the top of the existing rock armoured slope.

The values in the Table above Designated Flood Level are site specific and those shown are guideline values for 
these examples.  The values in the Table below Designated Flood Level result from the site specific values based on 
the procedures defined in the Standards and Guidelines referenced in this document
