All five highway segments examined also exhibited vulnerability to snowmelt driven peak flow events 
(freshet conditions). Such conditions generated risk profiles very similar to those associated with 
extreme precipitation – with generally increased risk of failure of drainage appliances, culverts and 
stabilization works (British Columbia Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure, 2014b). These and 
other potential vulnerabilities identified through the assessments are listed in Table 6).  

4.3 ADAPTATION PRACTICES 

As a result of its climate change vulnerability studies, the provincial Ministry of Transportation and 
Infrastructure now requires infrastructure design work for the Ministry to include climate change 
implications.  This includes a design criteria sheet where the designer indicates climate design 
baseline information, any additional climate change factors, and how the design will accommodate 
these climate changes over the infrastructure’s service life.  British Columbia is one of the first 
jurisdictions to require specific climate change adaptation measures to be included in infrastructure 
design work.  

The Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure also provides tools which can reduce safety risks 
to road users posed by extreme weather. Its DriveBC program aims to improve highway safety, by 
providing better real-time travel information for provincial highways on extreme weather conditions, 
road work, and closures. Since the program started in 2005, it has become the Ministry’s most popular 
online tool (British Columbia Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure, 2015).
