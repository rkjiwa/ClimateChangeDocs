subdivision 
servicing bylaws 
can specify 
measures such 
as bioswales 
(see photo), 
boulevards, rain 
gardens, topsoil 
requirements, 
sloping streets 
to drain into 
infiltration areas, 
landscaping 
requirements to 
increase onsite 
infiltration, 
and others.

Certain aspects of wildfire hazards can also be addressed through subdivision and servicing bylaws. 
For  example,  the  District  of  Elkford’s  climate  change  adaptation  strategy  recommends  updating 
subdivision and servicing requirements to ensure that sidewalks, boulevards and highways serve 
as firebreaks and so that they will provide effective fire evacuation routes. Trails, particularly in per-
imeter areas can also be useful firebreaks. It is also important that roads be designed to provide 
access for firefighting efforts, that there is an adequate water supply for fire suppression, and that fire 
hydrants are provided where appropriate. Underground wiring may be specified.29

Researchers are developing innovative ways to evaluate the performance of drainage 
systems and assess how they will deal with increased precipitation. Taylor David (a LIDAR 
applications specialist with Terra Remote Sensing Inc.) and Chris Jensen (currently, Policy 
Analyst, Integrated Policy Branch, MCSCD) used integrated airborne remote sensing to get 
a better understanding of how the Bowker Creek watershed handles major storm events.
