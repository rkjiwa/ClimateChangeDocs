 Learning from Others: The Forestry Adaptation 
Community of Practice

Adapting forest management policies and practices within a complex system, such as 
SFM, can be challenging. Fortunately, many “early adapters” have completed forestry-
related vulnerability assessments (e.g., CCFM case studies summary report by Johnston 
and Edwards 2013), and the lessons learned and good practices are available to others via 
an online community of practice (https://www.ccadaptation.ca/en/facop). The Forestry 
Adaptation Community of Practice (also known as FACoP) is hosted by the Ontario Centre 
for Climate Impacts and Adaptation Resources. It is a subcommunity within a broader 
online climate change adaptation community of practice (http://www.ccadaptation.ca).  
Everyone is welcome to join, and users of this guidebook are encouraged to use this 
forum to share lessons learned and methods used to assess the vulnerability of their SFM 
policies, plans, and practices.

 Tools and Resources for Vulnerability 
Assessment

An ever-increasing number of vulnerability assessment examples and climate change 
adaptation tools are being documented and published. Many of these examples have 
been related to assessing the vulnerability of forested ecosystems and developing 
adaptation options to reduce these vulnerabilities. 

This guidebook adds to the toolbox by going beyond the 
assessment of forest ecosystems to assessing the vulnerability 
of SFM goals and objectives.

Forestry-Related Vulnerability Assessment Examples
 

•   The CCFM vulnerability assessment case studies report (Johnston and Edwards 2013) 

highlights 10 forestry-related vulnerability assessments from across Canada:  
http://www.ccfm.org/pdf/ENG_CaseStudy_prf10.pdf.

 

 

 

•   Many projects undertaken by the Future Forest Ecosystem Scientific Council of British 

Columbia involved the conduct of ecosystem vulnerability assessments:

•   The U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service has published information about its 

ecosystem vulnerability assessment in northern Wisconsin (Swanston et al. 2011):  
http://www.fs.fed.us/nrs/pubs/gtr/gtr_nrs82.pdf.

• 

 The U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service has also published information about 
its vulnerability assessment of the Olympic National Forest (Halofsky et al. 2011b):  
http://www.fs.fed.us/pnw/pubs/pnw_gtr844.pdf.
