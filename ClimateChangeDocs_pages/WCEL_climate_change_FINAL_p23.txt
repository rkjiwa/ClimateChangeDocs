Once they have assessed risk and vulnerability to impacts, it may be useful for local 
governments to undertake a “capacity assessment.” PHOTO COURTESy BC HyDRO

In general, mainstreaming climate change adaptation involves the following:

•	 Obtaining the relevant climate information in a form that can be used by local 

government staff and decisionmakers;

•	 Developing adequate knowledge and understanding of climate change impacts 
on the part of local government land use and financial planners, engineers and 
decisionmakers in relation to their areas of responsibility. This  will likely mean 
consulting with climate scientists and other scientific and technical specialists 
who have relevant expertise;

•	

•	

•	

Creating appropriate triggers in planning and decision-making processes — for 
example, including climate change impacts on development checklists, or 
having a certain level of investment in infrastructure trigger a requirement 
that any climate change impacts be considered in the context of infrastructure 
vulnerabilities. Even where climate change impacts have already been identified, 
these types of triggers are important to ensure that current measures are 
periodically reassessed in the context of updated climate science;

Carrying out robust community consultation processes so that businesses, 
households, individuals and community groups understand the basic science 
and will participate to some degree in developing and implementing adaptation 
strategies; and

Cooperating and collaborating with other local governments, provincial and 
federal  governments, government agencies, First Nations, and local associations 
to access adequate resources and capacity to assess climate change impacts and 
implement effective responses.
