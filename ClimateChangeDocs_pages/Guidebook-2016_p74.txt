4.  EVOLUTION OF FUTURE VALUES

Figure 24 |  Left: Evolution of the mean annual number of growing degree-days for the years 1971-2100 for the Greater  
Slave Lake region. The values are calculated using an ensemble of 79 simulations (75 from CMIP3 and 4  
 
from CRCM4), while the observations come from an NRCan dataset44,45. Right: The distributions values of  
 
the regional mean for observed values (black curve) and projected values are shown as the 10th, 50th, and  
 
90th percentiles of the ensemble of climate scenarios (green, blue, and red curves respectively).
