Local governments’ purposes include fostering the economic, social and environmental 
well-being of the community (Local Government Act, s. 2; Community Charter, s.7). To that 
end, communities invest in important infrastructure projects such as the construction of 
airports and public transportation, dedication of parks, building community centres and 
other public facilities, launching programs to support a range of activities in the com-
munity ranging from business to social initiatives to the arts. Some local governments 
develop local or regional economic development plans or strategies.

Changing weather patterns as a result of climate change may open up new economic 
opportunities, or affect the viability of existing economic activities.

BC has already experienced the devastating impacts of the mountain pine 
beetle and the economic and social impacts on forest-dependent communities.

Regions where the winter sports industry and related tourism are an important 
economic driver will particularly want to consider the possible impacts of 
warmer winters. See On Thin Ice: Winter Sports and Climate Change www.

•	 Drier summers and water shortages may affect recreational facilities. Penticton 
pioneered the use of water sources other than drinking water for the irrigation 
of parks and recreation areas. www.penticton.ca/EN/main/community/parks-

•	 Warmer, longer growing seasons, or changes in precipitation patterns could 

open up opportunities to grow new kinds of crops in the region, or significantly 
enhance or reduce the ability to irrigate or produce existing crops.

Some northern locations in BC may become more attractive to human migrants 
than previously as a result of warmer temperatures. See David Dyer, Adapting

Measures  to  enhance  food  security  might  include  protecting  agricultural  land  and 
agricultural  uses,  supporting  markets  for  local  produce,  making  land  available  for 
community  gardens,  and  educating  citizens  about  the  benefits  of  supporting  local 
agriculture given future uncertainties around imported food products.38

Climate change impacts may disproportionately affect more vulnerable sectors of the 
population, and local governments will want to develop community services, programs 
and policies accordingly. For example, compromised water quality is a particular concern 
for the young, elderly and those with health conditions, and may result from increased 
run-off, landslides, and warmer water temperatures.39 Elderly, isolated people, particularly
