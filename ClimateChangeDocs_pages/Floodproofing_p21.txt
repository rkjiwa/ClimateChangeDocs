Household Hazardous Materials 
 
Some  household  materials  are  potentially  hazardous  to  the  environment  and  human  health.  These 
products should therefore be securely stored to prevent their release during a flood. To reduce the risk of 
contamination: 
 

  Clearly identify and label contents of, drums, or other containers, especially when materials are 

placed in other than their original containers; 

  Place your name and address on larger fuel and propane tanks to facilitate identification of their 

contents and their return if they become displaced; 

  Store drums and containers in areas that are least susceptible to flood waters. When possible, 

keep them in fenced enclosures, cabinets, or storerooms; 

  Minimize the amounts and types of materials kept on site. Purchase only what you need; 
 

If time permits dispose of household hazardous waste materials prior to a flood, at a household 
hazardous  waste  collection  centre.  For  more  information  on  how  to  dispose  of  household 
hazardous waste materials, contact your local Solid Waste Commission.
