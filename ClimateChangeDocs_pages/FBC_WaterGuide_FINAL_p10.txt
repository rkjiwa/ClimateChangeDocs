3. Preparing for  
Climate Change  
& its impacts

“Building adaptive capacity requires a strong, unifying 
vision; scientific understanding of the problems; an 
openness to face challenges; pragmatism in developing 
solutions; community involvement; and commitment at 
the highest political level” 

  –Holmes, 1996 in Smit et al. 20011

This section of the guide provides information about climate  
change and the range of its potential impacts on water and 
watersheds in BC. It also provides basic information about 
the adaptation process, including the identification of climate 
vulnerabilities, risks, and risk management strategies. Lastly,
