Worksheet 4.5.   Decision point: Is adaptation required?

If the SFM system of interest is vulnerable to climate change impacts or if the system is 
expected to be vulnerable in any of the future climate scenarios, you will want to proceed 
with identifying and implementing adaptation options (as detailed in sections 7.5 and 7.6, 
below). If the vulnerability of the SFM system is low and the potential effects of climate 
change under the various scenarios are mild, you may wish to monitor the system and 
reassess vulnerability as you gain new knowledge, learning, or insights.

   No

Proceed to sections 7.5 and 7.6

Continue to monitor the SFM system and  
reassess vulnerability if changes are noticed  
or if new knowledge is gained
