The winter weather challenge
for homeowners

Winter weather represents a signi!cant challenge for all Canadians.
For homeowners, in particular, cold temperatures, heavy snowfall
and ice build-ups represent potentially signi!cant sources of property
damage. Frozen pipes, water leaks, and roof damage can easily occur
without adequate preparation for winter weather.

Canada experiences some of the most extreme winter weather in the
world. This weather usually occurs in one of two forms that Canadians
are quite used to: winter storms and extreme cold. The 1998 Ontario
and Quebec ice-storm, for example,
represents one of the most
expensive natural disasters in
Canadian history costing over 
$5.4 billion to recover from its
damage. A thick layer of freezing
rain coated hydro towers, electricity
and telephone lines leaving over 
4 million people in Ontario, Quebec
and New Brunswick without power. 

All areas of Canada have also
experienced temperatures below
-40 C (except for Prince Edward
Island). During “cold snaps” when the temperature drops for sustained
periods of time, homeowners battle frozen pipes, which can lead to
ruptures and signi!cant water damage. 

Most research on preparing for winter weather focuses on taking
precaution while driving, or how to dress to keep warm during
extreme cold, but does not inform homeowners on how to minimize
damage from such weather. This handbook is designed to address this
gap. It identi!es several steps homeowners can take to protect their
homes from extreme winter weather and provides a scorecard that 
can help evaluate potential vulnerability.
