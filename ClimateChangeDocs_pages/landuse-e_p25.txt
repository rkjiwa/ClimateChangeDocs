Dawson Climate Change Risk Evaluation64
Dawson City, Yukon (population 1350), is located just below the Arctic Circle at 64°N. In 2007, Dawson partnered 
with a local non-profit organization, the Northern Climate ExChange, to develop a community adaptation plan.  
An evaluation of climate change-related risks was an important component of the planning process. 
Public consultations were undertaken to identify community vulnerabilities and potential opportunities arising  
from climate change. The project team and a local advisory committee distilled community issues into a list of  
78 “community consequences” of climate change. For each of those, risk evaluation tables were completed jointly 
by the project team and the advisory committee. An overall priority level (low, medium and high) for each impact 
was established through consideration of the severity and likelihood of a particular impact and the capacity of the 
community to take action to address it. Suggested adaptation actions were formulated for all consequences, and 
one or more partner organizations (for example, Yukon government and Dawson City council) were identified to 
provide leadership. See the framework example, in this case used to analyse agriculture/urban land-use conflicts.

Risk evaluation framework

Community consequence

Agriculture expands and potentially conflicts with 
other land use types (urban development, industry and 
wilderness areas).
