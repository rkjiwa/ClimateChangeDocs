As impacts of climate change become more apparent, the adaptive capacity of many 
communities may be challenged or exceeded but the severity of these impacts, reducing their 
ability to adapt. “Extreme impacts can exceed human and financial resources to address them, 
and can cause physical, financial and psychological stress. Stress on local governments and 
service providers, and other responders to disasters, can reduce adaptive capacity to address 
climate change impacts in both the short and long terms” (Manuel et al., 2012 in Lemmen, D.S., 
et. al. 2016 p. 118). Building partnerships and relationships with communities so that they can 
address key vulnerabilities over the long-term will help address this challenge. 

No Regrets 

The broader benefits of acting to adapt to climate risks is the low/no regrets model where 
decisions or actions related to climate change make sense in development terms regardless 
if a specific climate threat materializes in the future. This is achieved by building resilience to 
changing economic, social and environmental conditions (Adapted from Siegel, 2011). This 
approach is useful when considering how to plan and prioritize adaptation measures. One 
can ask: will we regret doing this if the climate threat does not materialize? Is this action 
good for Yukon communities even if the climate threat turns out to not be as severe as 
some scenarios project?
