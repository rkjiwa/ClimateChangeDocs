Strategic considerations  

If you are doing a quick or cursory assessment that involves only in-house resources, focus 
the scope by identifying and securing those resources that are available in-house, and keep 
the spatial scale of the assessment small.

Develop an inventory of internal and external resources that is as comprehensive as 
possible. The scope and complexity of an assessment is often dictated by the resources 
available, so be as thorough as possible in preparing your inventory.

Regularly revisit your inventory of available resources. The availability of resources may 
change over time, so review resource requirements regularly and be on the lookout for 
opportunities to take advantage of additional resources.

If resources are limited, do not be dismayed. Although having more resources may increase 
the information available to serve as a basis for the assessment, there will remain many 
irreducible uncertainties related to climate change. Focusing available resources into a 
“smart” process may pay more dividends than throwing a lot of resources at an ill-conceived 
process. Resource constraints can help to focus efforts, prioritize activities, and stimulate the 
development of innovative methods for assessing vulnerability and adaptation options.

Chapter 1  Completion Check-in

Has the assessment team:  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  Understood the reasons for doing an SFM vulnerability assessment?

 

 Developed a clear statement of purpose for the assessment and a statement of 
expected outcomes?

  Described the spatial extent and forest structure of the area of interest?
  Described the decision-making scope and actors within the SFM system of interest?

 

 Assessed whether the available resources match the purpose and expected 
outcomes?

  Confirmed the scope of the assessment?

 

 Made an explicit decision to go forward with the vulnerability assessment and 
adaptation process?

The assessment team may also wish to:

 

 

 

 

 Develop a team charter and work plan detailing responsibilities and timelines for 
individuals and organizations participating in the assessment

 Develop a communications plan to ensure that decision makers and other 
interested parties (e.g., stakeholders) are kept informed of the purpose and progress 
of the assessment
