KEY MESSAGES 
FOR THE INTERPRETATION AND USE OF CLIMATE INFORMATION
 › Take the time to properly evaluate your needs regarding climate information.

Interaction with climate service or information providers is of utmost importance throughout the planning or  

 ›
  decision process- make sure that the provider understands your issues.

 › Seek advice and guidance from climate service providers and/or boundary organizations if the level of complexity  
  of the information you seek is beyond the current capacity of your organization.

 › The same climate information can be presented or tailored using different formats – work in collaboration with  
  climate service providers to find a format that works best for your specific needs.

 › Choosing the most adequate information product and format can ensure that the information is well understood  
  and hence used most efficiently.

 › All types of climate information can be equally valuable – basic information can inform decisions just as well as  
  detailed information.

 › Do not rely solely on the mean or median scenario – the range (i.e. the uncertainty) in model projections should  
  always be considered.

 › There is no such thing as the best climate scenario – the use of an ensemble of simulations is crucial.

 › Understand the limitations of the climate information used and make sure the information is interpreted  
  correctly.

 › The natural variability in the climate is valuable information– use it to put the projected changes into     
  perspective.

 › Finer spatial resolution is not always needed and does not always yield better information.

 › The relative importance of sources of uncertainty varies over time and therefore impact the decision-making  
  process differently.
