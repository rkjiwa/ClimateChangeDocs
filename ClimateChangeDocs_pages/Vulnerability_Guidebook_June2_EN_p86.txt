1.1-D.      Factors causing significant concern
This step is intended to help identify and define significant concerns about the effects of 
climate change on SFM. Answering the following question can help participants maintain 
focus on the issues at hand.

Is there a significant concern about the effects of climate change on SFM in the region of 
interest, and if so, why?

Worksheet 1.2.   Describe the SFM system and define the scope 

of the vulnerability assessment 

The following types of information, among others, are needed to describe the SFM system 
of interest:

 

 

 

 

•  spatial and structural description of the managed forest system

•   benefits and values derived from the forest, including industrial production values 

and nontimber values

•   overview of the organization or agency that is proposing to undertake the 

assessment, including information about its responsibility and mandate for SFM

•   description of how SFM is defined and implemented relative to the system of interest 

(i.e., SFM objectives).

The following sections of this worksheet provide guidance on describing the various 
aspects and elements of the SFM system of interest.

1.2-A.     Description of the managed forest
Describe the spatial extent of the managed forest area selected for the vulnerability 
assessment. Provide details about factors relevant to forest management (e.g., types and 
distribution of ecosystems, species, age classes, timber volumes, disturbances), as well as 
the timber and nontimber benefits and values derived from the forest (e.g., wood values, 
recreational use, wildlife-related benefits, intrinsic forest values).
