1.1 NATURAL CLIMATE VARIABILITY
The climate is not constant. While the weather 
varies on a daily basis, climate captures variations 
on all time scales, from one decade or century to the 
next, and even on a seasonal and yearly basis (Figure 
2). For example some winters are warmer than 
others and annual precipitation is greater in some 
years than others. These differences are referred to 
as the natural variability in the climate, or climate 
variability. Some of these natural fluctuations in 
the climate are chaotic and unpredictable, while 

others are caused by phenomena that are more or 
less cyclic, and may occur at different time-scales. 
Examples of factors that impact the response of 
the climate include the solar cycle15, the role of the 
stratosphere16, and the role of oceanic circulation 
patterns17. Many such climatic phenomena that are 
part of real world natural variability emerge from 
climate model simulations but they often exhibit 
different statistical properties.

without the effect of a long-term trend (such as would be produced under a climate signal with increases in  
GHG).
