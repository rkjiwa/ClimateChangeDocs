Anticipatory    
 
Activities that are taken before impacts are observed 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Planned  

 

 

 

 

Deliberate actions aimed at adaptation 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 
  

 

 

 

 

Reactive 

Activities that are taken after impacts have occured 

Autonomous 

Activities to spontaneously cope with climate impacts 

 

Anticipatory  and  planned  ecosystem-based  adaptation  measures  that  use  a  range  of  opportunities  for  sustainable 
management, conservation, and restoration are the focus of this guide.  

The  guide  provides  tools  and  examples  for  identifying  and  prioritizing  adaptation  actions  to  reduce  threats,  enhance 
resilience of species and systems, engage people, and improve knowledge. 

 

 

 

Vulnerability in the context of climate change is defined as “the degree to which a system is susceptible to, and unable to cope with, 
adverse effects of climate change, including climate variability and extremes. Vulnerability is a function of the character,  magnitude, 
and  rate  of  climate  change  and  variation to  which  a  system  is  exposed,  [and]  the sensitivity  and adaptive  capacity  of that  system” 
(IPCC, 2007c). In other words, systems and species that will undergo the greatest change, are sensitive to that change, and have the 
least ability to adapt quickly are the most vulnerable (Lemmen and Warren, 2004).
