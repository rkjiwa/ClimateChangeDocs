AiR quAlity PlAnning

Regional  districts  may  make  regulations  related  to  emissions  of  smoke,  dust,  gas,  sparks,  ash, 
soot, cinders, fumes or other effluvia (Local Government Act, s. 725(1)(g)) if they provide a related 
service. (s.797.1(1)(d)). The Greater Vancouver Regional District (Metro Vancouver) has a specific 
power to provide the service of air quality management within its jurisdiction (Environmental 
Management Act, s. 31)

Municipalities also have broad powers under the Community Charter (ss. 8(3),(i),(j) and (h) and s. 
64) with respect to public health and public nuisances that can be applied to address air quality 
issues such as backyard burning and wood burning appliances.

Why look at air quality planning as part of climate change adaptation:

•	

Rising temperatures may contribute to increased air pollution and in particular higher 
ozone levels, which in turn may lead to public health concerns. Air quality impacts of 
climate change in the Fraser Valley are currently being studied. http://summit.sfu.ca/

Examples:

•	

•	

The Clean Air Bylaws Guide provides a number of examples from across BC of local 
governments taking action to regulate air pollution within their communities. www.
wcel.org/sites/default/files/publications/The%20Clean%20Air%20Bylaws%20Guide.pdf

See also the provincial inventory of air quality bylaws in BC www.env.gov.bc.ca/epd/
bcairquality/topics/municipal-smoke-bylaws.html

To consider:

•	

Air quality planners should be assessing the potential impact of rising temperatures, 
both average and extreme, and applying the information obtained to update or revise 
air quality plans.
