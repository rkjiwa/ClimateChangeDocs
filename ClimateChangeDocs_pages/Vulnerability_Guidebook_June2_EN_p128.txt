Worksheet 4.4.   Assess overall SFM system vulnerability

Bring all the analyses together to create a larger picture. Are you currently able to meet 
your SFM objectives? Are your SFM goals and objectives vulnerable to climate change? 
How is the system vulnerable? Given current climate and climate variability and expected 
future climate change impacts, what are the reasons that certain SFM goals and objectives 
may not be met?
