 

It should be noted that these criteria do not cover all possible configurations of sea dikes, or all 
issues that may be pertinent, and detailed engineering investigations may be required in specific 
cases.

Note: 
The existing criteria are vague on the definition of a building structural element. 

 
The criteria in Table 4-1 were partially validated in 2007 by tests using an overtopping simulator on 
a  real  sea  dike  in  the  Netherlands.    The  dike  had  an  landward  slope  of  1:3  (V:H)  and  was 
constructed  of  clay  (less  than  30  per  cent  sand)  with  a  thick  grass  sod  cover.    The  sea  dike 
successfully withstood a series of simulated 6 hour storms, up to a mean overtopping rate of 50 
liters/s/m. 
After  the  first  test,  the  grass  sod  was  removed  and  the  sequence  of  simulated  storms  was 
repeated.  It  was  found  that  erosion  damage started  on  the “unprotected”  dike  at  an  overtopping 
rate of 0.1 liters/s/m.  After 6 hours of overtopping at a mean rate of 10 liters/s/m, the sea dike was 
considered “not too far from initial breaching”.
