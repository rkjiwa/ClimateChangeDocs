 

Vancouver Island (as recorded at Tofino), its passage up Juan de Fuca Strait (as recorded at 
Victoria and then into the Strait of Georgia (as recorded at Point Atkinson).  The peak of the 
surge, at approximately 22:00 hr on 12 December at Point Atkinson, occurred 5 hours earlier 
at Tofino and only increased in magnitude by approximately 0.1 m.  The peak of the surge, 
which is at least 6 hours long (within a 0.1 m tolerance), coincided with a peak in the gale 
force SE winds that characterised this particular storm.  
As part of this assignment, the self-similar characteristics of the incident surge wave from the 
North  Pacific  were  examined  for  multiple  storms  and  the  trend  exhibited  in  Figure  2-4  is 
typical.    On  the  basis  of  these  trends  the  expected  magnitudes  for  the  incident  deepwater 
storm surge were grouped and characterized as described in this report.

Local Storm Surge 
The incident deepwater storm surge, as illustrated in Figure 2-4, will be further modified as it 
propagates over shallow water, especially across the extensive tidal flats in the Fraser River 
Delta.    Methods  for  estimating  the  additional  effects  are  provided  in  the  Reference 
Publications.
