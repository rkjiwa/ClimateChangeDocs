Impacts in some regions could include…

•	 Reduced snowpack and earlier snowmelt, meaning earlier spring flows and 

•	
•	
•	

reduced April to September streamflows 
Increased risk of drought (more prolonged and intense) in some areas
Increased risk of flooding in some areas
Increased competition for water with implications for local and regional 
allocations, as well as transborder agreements
•	 Warmer water temperatures in lakes and rivers
•	 Changes in water quality
•	 Hydrological changes in watersheds affected by mountain pine beetle 

resulting from tree mortality and increases in logging activity

•	 Reduced groundwater recharge and discharge, while at the same time 

increased demands for groundwater as a result of reduced surface water 
flows
Increased contamination of surface water due to flooding

•	
•	 Aquifer contamination or depletion; saltwater intrusion in coastal areas

•	

Increased demand for irrigation for the south coast and southern interior 
regions at the same time that summer flows will be decreasing
Increased pest pressure resulting from winter survival of pests and diseases

•	
•	 More frequent and sustained droughts
•	
•	 Waterlogged soils in some areas due to flooding and increased winter 

Increased salinity in coastal areas

precipitation
Increased flooding leading to increased leaching of agricultural chemicals
Increased risk of smoke-damaged crops in some regions

•	
•	
•	 Possible increase in productivity for some crops and new opportunities for 

heat-requiring species in some areas

•	 Potential opportunities for new crops in northern areas resulting from longer 

growing seasons, depending on soil suitability, water availability and other 
factors

•	 Shift in the distribution and range of species
•	 Loss of species not able to adapt to changes
•	
Increased competition from invasive species
•	 Loss and fragmentation of habitat
•	

Increased wildfire frequency and severity, which will challenge some 
ecosystems but may benefit fire-maintained ecosystems

•	 Large-scale pest outbreaks
•	 Challenges to the capacity of BC’s system of protected areas as species are 

forced to migrate
