Informed Judgements

Public perceptions of climate change have been widely documented and have been the focus of considerable 
research in recent years. In addition, expert judgments (generally defined as those of well-recognized researchers) 
have been used to forecast and assess probabilities and risks and have provided useful insights for decision 
makers, particularly in situations characterized by complexity and deep uncertainty. Although some efforts have 
been made to document the judgments of members of the professional and practitioner communities on matters 
related to climate change, research in this area has received considerably less attention. A notable gap is research to 
document the informed judgments of forest practitioners on priorities and mechanisms for adaptation.  

It may be useful for forest managers to gain experience in developing and evaluating alternative adaptation 
options. Integrating considerations related to climate change adaptation into existing decision-making processes 
is called “mainstreaming” and can lead to “win–win” policies, i.e., those that reduce vulnerability to climatic change 
while simultaneously addressing other priorities. It is also important for key local actors and institutions to be 
involved in mainstreaming, because they play significant roles in knowledge transfer and policy development. 
Interventions will be more successful if they are identified and developed by local actors, as they (the interventions) 
are more likely to be consistent with local priorities, goals, norms, and institutions. Conversely, a recommendation 
developed without consultation with local communities and/or government institutions is far less likely to be 
adopted.

Forest practitioners play a critical role in adaptation planning. They are involved with the planning and 
management of forest-based resources and frequently collaborate with ecological, economic, social, and cultural 
experts, as well as holders of local, traditional, and/or scientific knowledge of forest-based resources. Practitioners 
are well-informed, highly knowledgeable individuals whose employment or livelihood is tied to the forest sector 
and who are typically employed by key decision-making agencies; alternatively, they may be stakeholders who 
are instrumental in driving forestry decision making. Documenting the informed judgments of practitioners 
could therefore provide useful insights into the state of knowledge and practice on climate adaptation and the 
readiness of practitioners to engage in adaptive strategies. The applied knowledge held by forest practitioners can 
also provide useful insights for decision makers while research to produce more definitive results is in progress, 
particularly in situations characterized by complexity and deep uncertainty (see Walker et al. [2013] for more on 
adaptation under deep uncertainty). 

Forest practitioners work at the confluence of government, scientific, and community knowledge and priorities 
and as such are experts in the local context. They also play an important role in developing, implementing, and/
or reviewing operational forest management plans to ensure that community-directed goals and objectives 
of forest management are achieved. Within the experiential knowledge base of local practitioners rests an 
applied understanding of local priorities, goals, norms, and institutions. There are many trade-offs involved in 
forest management decision making, trade-offs that are well understood by those who are experts in the local 
context. This expertise is incredibly useful to an assessment of climate change vulnerabilities and the regional 
appropriateness of adaptation options and strategies. An exploration of practitioners’ viewpoints on adaptation 
measures in a local context also creates the opportunity to build a collective understanding of locally appropriate 
measures that might be taken to adapt to climate change. In addition, raising awareness of the range of alternative 
adaptation options within this community can facilitate changes in policy and practice. In this way, exposing 
practitioners to adaptation-related questions might help to build the necessary foundation for their incorporation 
into longer-term forest management and planning-related decisions.
