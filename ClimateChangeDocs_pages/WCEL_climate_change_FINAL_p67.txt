civic Building Policy And Building RegulAtion

Local governments can define acceptable practices and standards for the construction 
and  retrofitting  of  civic  buildings,  either  for  specific  buildings  or  with  a  civic  building 
policy, such as a green building policy.34 

Local governments also have limited authority to regulate private building construction 
activities. A municipality may — with provincial approval (because this is an area of con-
current authority) — use its bylaw powers to establish a standard that exceeds Building 
Code requirements. However, local governments may also indirectly affect private build-
ing design and construction through development permits, development cost charge 
reductions  or  waivers  that  incentivize  specific  practices,  fast  tracking  of  development 
permits where buildings incorporate specific features, or revitalization tax reductions for 
certain types of construction or retrofitting.35

To consider:

•	

There are many ways that buildings can be adapted to a changing climate, and 
made more resilient to higher temperatures, extreme weather events, water 
shortages, flooding and wildfire. See www.buildinggreen.com/auth/article.
