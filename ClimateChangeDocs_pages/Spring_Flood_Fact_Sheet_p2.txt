Before A Flood 
  Practice your family emergency plan.  Plan and practice flood evacuation routes from home, 

work, and school that are on higher ground. 

  Conduct a thorough home inventory.  Thorough documentation of your belongings will help you 

file your flood insurance claim.  For more information, visit http://www.ready.gov/insurance-vital-
records. 

During A Flood 
  Go to higher ground.  Get out of areas subject to flooding, including dips, low spots, washes, etc. 
  Avoid areas already flooded, especially when water flows fast.  Do not attempt to cross flowing 

streams.  Just six inches of moving water can knock you off your feet. 

  Never drive through flooded roadways.  Roadbeds may be washed out under flood waters and 

just two feet of moving water can sweep an SUV off the road. 

After A Flood 
  Check for damage.  Check for structural damage before re-entering your home.  If you suspect 

damage to water, gas, electric, or sewer lines, contact authorities. 

  Remove wet contents immediately.  Wet carpeting, furniture, bedding and any other items 

holding moisture can develop mold within 24 to 48 hours.  Clean and disinfect everything touched 
by floodwaters. 

  Plan before you repair.  Contact your local building inspections or planning office or your county 

clerk’s office to get more information on local building requirements. 

  File your flood insurance claim.  Be sure to provide: the name of your insurance company, your 

policy number, and contact information.  Take photos of any water in the house and damaged 
personal property.  Make a detailed list of all damaged or lost items.
