•	 One of the benefits of looking at climate change adaptation through the lens of asset 
management is the increased ability to effectively communicate the longer term costs 
and benefits of action to decisionmakers. Some climate change impacts will only become 
significant over the longer term, i.e. within the next 50–100 years. This is within the life 
cycle of most infrastructure, and, ideally, infrastructure planning should account for climate 
change impacts. However, budget cycles are typically much shorter, making it easy in 
practice to defer action, unless the longer term costs and risks are well understood. Robert

Canada Mortgage Housing Corporation (CMHC) has designed a tool to compare the life 
cycle costs of different infrastructure options for major community developments, and this 
tool may be useful in the context of climate change adaptation. Life Cycle Costing Tool for 
Community Infrastructure Planning  www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/inpr/su/sucopl/licycoto/

Asset management may also be addressed in other local government planning processes. 
Metro Vancouver’s Integrated Liquid Waste and Resource Management Plan requires that 
asset management plans for wastewater treatment plants be updated to address risks, 
including climate change and seismic events, and maintain performance in wet weather.
