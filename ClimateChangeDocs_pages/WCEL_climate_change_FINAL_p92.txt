getting started on climate change adaptation

 F Has the Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium (PCIC) Plan2Adapt modeling (http://

pacificclimate.org/tools-and-data/plan2adapt) for the region been accessed to gain an 
understanding of the projected climate scenarios and impacts?

 F Has a review of climate change impacts and management considerations (for the local 

government) been completed?

 F If appropriate, has locally relevant, downscaled climate modeling been obtained?

 F Is council/board well-briefed on climate change impacts in the community and the 

rationale for action?

 F Has the community engaged in a climate change assessment process that has identified 

vulnerabilities, quantified risk, and decided on priority areas for action?

 F Has local knowledge about climate change and its impacts been included in the 

assessment process?

 F If a climate change assessment process has not yet been undertaken, could this process be 

linked to OCP review and updating?

 F Has a list of key stakeholders for consultation and possible partners for implementation 

of adaptation strategies been identified (noting that this list needs to include climate 
scientists, emergency personnel, and others who might not typically be consulted)?

 F Have any important information gaps related to climate change impacts and adaptation 

been identified, and a course of action determined?

 F Has a scan of programs, policies and bylaws that could be affected by, or could include 

climate change adaptation, been carried out?

 F What actions are already in place that can be considered adaptation?

 F Given the projected climate change impacts in the community, what level of resources is it 

appropriate to commit for staff, and/or consultants?

 F Which staff representatives (area/level) should be on an interdepartmental climate change 
adaptation committee â€” finance/ asset management, engineering/operations and works, 
planning, parks and recreation, emergency preparedness, communications, etc.?

 F Should a select, standing or advisory committee be established?

 F Are there currently in-stream applications or proposed developments or civic projects that 

should be re-evaluated in light of climate change impacts?
