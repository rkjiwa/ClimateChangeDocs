Churchill is capable of handling Panamax-sized vessels with four berths totaling over 900m in length, 
although these facilities are modest compared to other Canadian ports. The Port of Churchill 
operates within (approximately) a 14-week shipping season, beginning in mid-July and extending to 
the end of October/early November. The shipping season is estimated to lengthen by two to three 
weeks over the 21st century in tandem with a shorter sea-ice season in the Hudson Strait (Hochheim 
and Barber, 2014), offering new opportunities for resource and resupply shipping (Lackenbauer and 
Lajeunesse, 2014). The seasonal duration of sea ice in this area has declined since record-keeping 
began in the 1970s (Tivy et al., 2007; Hochheim and Barber, 2014).

3.0 CLIMATE PROFILE

The Prairies are generally characterized by extreme differences in seasonal temperatures (an annual 
range of more than 70˚C), and high year-to-year variability in precipitation (resulting in frequent 
flooding and recurrent drought). Because of the region’s mid-latitude location in the rain shadow 
of the Rocky Mountains, the climate is generally cold and sub-humid (Sauchyn and Kulshreshtha, 
2008). The region’s southern core has a sub-humid climate that becomes semi-arid during periods 
of drought (Lemmen et al., 1998). Water balance increases moving west, north, and east from this 
core area. Snow is a critical form of seasonal water storage throughout the region. Chinook winds, 
that can raise air temperatures by more than 20˚C and rapidly deplete snow cover, are a common 
winter phenomenon in the foothills and prairies of the southwest. Severe summer storms and lightning 
– often associated with damaging hail (Kovacs and Thistlethwaite, 2014) and, occasionally, tornadoes 
(Environment Canada, 2015a) – are key climate risks in the Prairies.

In the context of a changing climate, increasing water scarcity represents a risk to the region. Also, 
the Prairies are likely to lose advantages associated with cold winters, particularly as they relate to 
winter roads (Sauchyn and Kulshreshtha, 2008).

3.1 PAST TRENDS

Instrumental climate records on the Prairies extend more than 120 years. Despite high year-to-year 
variability, long-term records demonstrate increasing mean annual temperatures, ranging from 
0.9˚C at Calgary, Alberta, to 2.7˚C in Swift Current, Saskatchewan for the period 1895-2005 (Sauchyn, 
2010). For the period from 1948 to 2014, the warming trend in the southern Prairies was 1.5˚C, with 
northern areas experiencing even greater warming (approximately 1.8˚C) (Environment Canada, 
2015b). This warming is similar to the average increase for Canada as a whole (1.6˚C) (Environment 
Canada, 2015b) and is about twice the increase in mean global temperature over the same period 
(Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2013). The greatest warming is evident in winter and 
spring, with the least occurring in fall (Vincent et al., 2012).

In addition to significant variability between and among years, there is also significant spatial 
variability across the region. In examining mean annual temperature trends, research (Danny Blair 
and Ryan Smith, University of Winnipeg, personal communication, 2015) demonstrates that most of 
the region experienced no statistically significant change (at a 95% confidence level) for the 32-year 
period from 1981 to 2013 (Figure 4). However, this indicates the importance of long-term records in 
defining climate trends. For the 60-year period from 1950 to 2010, Vincent et al. show statistically-
significant increases in mean annual temperature for almost all sites in the Prairies, and no sites in the 
region show a cooling trend (Vincent et al., 2012; Bush et al., 2014).
