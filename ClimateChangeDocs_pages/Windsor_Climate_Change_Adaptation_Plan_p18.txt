Proposed Adaptation Options 

The table below summarizes our proposed short-term adaptation actions in response to the medium 
high – extreme risks identified above.  The anticipated changes in climate that garnered the most 
concern to the City of Windsor were: increase in precipitation and increase in extreme summer heat 
events. The adaptation actions in Table 6 are divided into sub-categories, based on the type of risk they 
reduce. Many of these short-term actions build on existing programs in recognized areas of 
vulnerability.  Other adaptation options may be fairly new to the City of Windsor, however there is a 
growing level of experience for such actions amongst other municipalities.

on storm, sanitary and combined 
sewer systems , reduces number 
of treatment plant overflows 
Reduce the risk of basement 
flooding to individual homes 
Reduce the risk of basement 
flooding  

Reduce the risk of basement 
flooding 
Reduce the risk of basement 
flooding  
Reduce the risk of basement 
flooding 
Improves ability to design storm 
drainage infrastructure for 
extreme runoff events, reduces 
future City maintenance costs  

Co-Benefits 

Improved storm water quality 

 

Allows prioritization of sewer 
repairs/replacement, identifies 
problems before the required 
repairs become very costly and 
disruptive to residents

sewer overflows 
Reduce the amount of combined 
sewer overflows 
Reduce the amount of combined 
sewer overflows
