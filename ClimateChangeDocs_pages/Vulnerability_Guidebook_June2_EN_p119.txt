4.2.4     Social capital (partnerships and networks) 
Social capital refers to human partnerships and networks. Such partnerships and 
networks can facilitate and contribute to innovative problem solving, improved access 
to information, collective actions, and access to resources that would not otherwise 
be available. Mutual respect and trust are important requirements for the effective 
functioning of partnerships and networks.
