models or as part of habitat models.

 Used when existing data preclude or are insufficient to 

develop a quantitative model. A series of workshops and/or 
surveys are often used to gather data from experts that are 
then used in model development.  

 In some cases, results from expert input are combined with 

other data (e.g., from existing publications).
