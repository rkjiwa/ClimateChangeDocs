 

In  Figure  4-4,  the  steep  future  shoreline  means  that  the  15m  minimum  setback  from  Natural 
Boundary supersedes the FCL contour elevation. 
In Figure 4-5, which illustrates the Year 2200 projected condition, additional SLR has moved the 
future  Natural  Boundary  further  inland,  and  combined  with  the  increase  in  FCL  has  made  the 
building constructed in 2010 not fully protected from the sea. The building is also likely to be at the 
end  of  its  lifespan  around  2100.  Rebuilding  on  or  after  2100  should  undertake  a  MANAGED 
RETREAT, and respect the Year 2200 FCL and Setback. 
If rebuilding is not proposed, the building will be at risk. Short of relocating the building, preparing 
the  lower  parts  of  the  building  to  ACCOMODATE  flooding  from  the  sea  should  be  required  â€“ 
through such measures as leaving only floodable uses such as parking on the lower floor, moving 
habitable quarters to the upper floor, or using water resistant materials on the lower floor.
