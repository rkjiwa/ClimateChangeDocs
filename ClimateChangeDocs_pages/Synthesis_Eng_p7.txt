The annual average surface air temperature over the Canadian landmass has warmed by 1.5°C over the period 
1950-2010

The frequency of warm days (when the daily maximum temperature is above the daily 90th percentile) during the 
summer has increased nationally since 1950
The frequency of cold nights (when the daily minimum temperature is below the daily 10th percentile) during the 
winter has decreased nationally since 1950

Canada has generally become wetter in recent decades, as indicated by the increasing trend in annual average 
precipitation
In several regions of southern Canada, there has been a shift in precipitation type, with decreasing snowfall and 
increasing rainfall
Observations suggest decreasing trends in maximum and minimum river flows over the period 1970-2005 in much 
of southern Canada, with increases in minimum flows in western Nunavut, Northwest Territories, Yukon and northern 
British Columbia
Annual snowfall has declined over most of southern Canada and increased in the north over the last 6 decades
Negative trends in snow cover extent have been observed during spring over the Canadian landmass, with largest 
declines observed in June

Permafrost temperatures at numerous borehole sites across Canada have increased over the past two to three decades

Global average sea level rose about 21 cm between 1880 and 2012 at an average rate of 1.6 mm/year
Relative sea level rise of over 3 mm/year has been observed on coastlines of Atlantic Canada and the Beaufort Sea 
coast, with lower amounts along Pacific coastlines. Relative sea level fall of 10 mm/year has been observed around 
Hudson Bay where the land is rising rapidly due to post-glacial rebound

End-of-summer minimum ice extent has declined at a rate of 13% per decade over 1979-2012, while maximum winter 
sea ice extent has declined at a rate of 2.6% per decade
A shift in ice cover from one dominated by thick multi-year ice (MYI) to one increasingly dominated by thin first-year 
ice (FYI) has been observed
Declines in winter sea ice extent have been observed in the Labrador-Newfoundland and Gulf of St. Lawrence region

Western Cordilleran glaciers are losing mass and shrinking rapidly to the smallest extents in several millennia.  
Glaciers in British Columbia and Alberta have lost, respectively, about 11% and 25% of their surface area over the 
period 1985-2005, while glaciers in Yukon have lost about 22% since the 1950s
Significant negative mass balances are evident from the early 1960s into the first decade of the 21st century. The 
rate of mass loss for glaciers throughout the High Arctic has increased sharply since 2005, in direct response to warm 
regional summer temperatures

Trends towards earlier ice-free dates (lakes) and ice break-up dates (rivers) have been observed for most of the country 
since the mid-20th century but are particularly evident in Western Canada

Long-term changes in ocean temperature (increasing), salinity (variable sign), and acidity (increasing) have been 
observed in all three of Canada’s oceans. Long-term decreases in subsurface dissolved oxygen levels have also been 
observed in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans off Canada
