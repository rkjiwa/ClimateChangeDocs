Yukon ‘State of Play’:  
Analysis of Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation 
 
6.  CHANGING CLIMATE, CHANGING LAND  

November 14, 2017 

There is clear evidence that vegetation zones are shifting, forests are more vulnerable to insect 
infestations and animal species' habitat, ranges, and diversity are changing. Changes to seasonal 
weather patterns and climate variability also have direct impacts on the way that some species 
of wildlife feed and breed. 

Climate is the most important factor that influences the development of terrestrial ecosystems. 
Within areas of similar climate, ecosystems vary because of differences in topography and soil. 
Shifting climates within these bioclimate zones may mean that some of the flora and fauna that 
have adapted to the historical climate of that area may face increasing ecological pressure under 
different present and future climatic conditions. These shifts drive changes in the type of 
vegetation that is present or pervasive in certain areas, and also to the seasonal events (e.g. 
flowering) in the lifecycle of native plants. Furthermore, climate change may also make areas 
more hospitable to invasive species, as it enables some plants, insects and animals to survive 
and thrive in parts of the territory that were previously less hospitable.

Wildlife species ranges are projected to shift northward on both land and sea, bringing new 
species into the north while limiting the range of other species already present on those 
landscapes. Seasonal changes are also affecting reproductive cycles and species productivity for 
some animals. In southern Yukon, for example, seasonal temperature increases have been
