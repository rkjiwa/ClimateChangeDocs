HURRICANE JUAN, HALIFAX, SEPTEMBER 2003

Cities in Atlantic Canada have also experienced severe impacts from extreme weather events, 
and climate models suggest the frequency of these events will increase in this region in the 21st 
century (AMEC Inc., 2011). Hurricane Juan, that struck Halifax on September 29th, 2003, was the 
most destructive storm in the city’s history, due to effects of storm surge (temporary sea-level rise), 
intense flooding, and strong winds (Environment Canada, 2013a). Sustained wind speeds reached 
a maximum of 160 km/h. Halifax Harbour experienced wind gusts up to 230km/h and storm surges 
of 1.5-2m, leading to severe shoreline erosion and the loss of railway tracks (Bowyer, 2003a). 
Containers were blown off ships in the port, and several rail cars were washed into the Atlantic 
at the Dartmouth rail yard (Bowyer, 2003c). The storm’s volatility and disruption to transportation 
services contributed to the closure of businesses and schools for five days (Bowyer, 2003b). 
The estimated cost of damages related to Hurricane Juan totaled $200 million (Environment 
Canada, 2013a). The event prompted decision-makers in Atlantic Canada to improve planning 
and preparation processes for extreme weather events: clearer channels were created for 
communication and coordination among provincial and local emergency response departments, 
and hurricane-specific training for emergency personnel was mandated in the immediate 
aftermath (Government of Nova Scotia, 2003).
