Sector

Impacts in some regions could include…

Forests, forest 
industry, parks 
and urban 
trees 

Tourism and 
recreation

Energy

•	 Ongoing impacts from the mountain pine beetle outbreak
•	 Losses in productivity in drier and warmer regions
•	 Shift in the distribution and range of species
•	
•	
•	
•	 Potential reduction in access to timber resulting from warmer, wetter weather 

Increased risk of insect outbreaks
Increased risk of forest fire, and potential for larger fires of higher intensity
Increased competition from invasive species

in winter, and increased risk of wildfire in summer

•	 Extreme winds leading to windfall
•	 Drier conditions leading to increased maintenance needs for urban trees 

(water, mulching, replacement)

•	 Modest increases in productivity in northern BC where soil moisture is 

adequate and fire risk is low

•	 Reduced opportunities for cold season recreation due to inadequate 

•	

snowfall, rising snowlines and/or reduced snow or ice quality
Increased reliance on snow-making at ski areas, requiring significant capital 
and water resources and favouring larger ski operators

•	 Decreased opportunities for warm season activities during the hottest part of 
the year, particularly in southern areas (e.g., from heat, forest fires, low water 
levels, reduced air quality)

•	 Coastal erosion and flooding affecting tourism in coastal communities, such 

as vacation housing and resort infrastructure
Increased need for hazard reduction and emergency management in the 
tourism and recreation sector to deal with increased floods, landslides, 
wildfires and avalanches
Increased opportunities for warm season activities in some regions

•	

•	

•	 Risk of decreased hydroelectric generating capacity due to water shortages 

resulting from reduced snow packs, declining glacier contributions and 
frequent drought 

•	 Reduced heating demand during winter months
•	
•	 Potential for increasing energy prices due to carbon pricing policies within BC 

Increased cooling demand during summer months

and outside BC
Increased likelihood of grid power interruption from extreme weather events

•	
•	 Emerging incentives to develop district energy systems and decentralized 

renewable energy sources that are less vulnerable to large-scale disruptions

•	 Ongoing incentives from utilities to encourage energy efficiency
