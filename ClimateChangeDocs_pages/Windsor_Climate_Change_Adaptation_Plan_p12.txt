Climate Change Adaptation Plan  2012 

 
As air temperatures increases, so does the capacity of the air to hold more water leading to more 
intense rainfall events.  Since 1970, there has been increasing evidence of heavier short duration (24 
hours or less) rain events in southern Ontario.  The following table summarizes the average trends in the 
amount of annual maximum rain events.   

Table 3: Summary of the observed and projected increases in rainfall over time in Windsor.

Recent extreme rain intensities in North Toronto 2005, 
Peterborough 2004 (photo insert) and the northern Grand River 
basin 2004 suggest there may be even more rapid trends 
towards increasing magnitude of heavy rain events in isolated 
storms.   

The City of Windsor has also been experiencing more intense 
rain events including:

Intense rainfalls estimated at or above the 1:50 year climate normal return frequency 

o  Westside flooding in 2007.  Anecdotal evidence and numerous reports estimated that 

100mm of rain fell in less than an hour.  
June 5 & 6 2010 flooding.  Approximately 90mm of rain fell in 4 hours  

o 

  2011: Windsor’s wettest year.  In 2011, the City of Windsor experienced the wettest year ever 

on record with 1568.2mm of rain compared to the average annual rainfall of 844mm.  
November 29th, 2011 alone received 75mm of rain.   

Surface Water Temperatures and Great Lakes Water Levels 

The temperatures of surface waters will continue to rise with the increase in annual temperatures.  This 
increase may allow for the establishment of new invasive species, as well as an increase in algae growth.  
Based on historical temperature monitoring of western Lake Erie, the length of winter (days with water 
temperatures below 4°C) is getting shorterxi.  A loss of ice cover may result in increased erosion of 
shoreline that was typically protected by winter ice.  Open surface water also allows for more 
evaporation.
