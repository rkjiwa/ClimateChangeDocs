Bracing kits can often be purchased from garage door manufacturers.
Homeowners may also need to add stronger supports and heavier
hinges for their garage doors.

Ridge and off-ridge vents
Faulty ridge vents can result in signi!cant water intrusion in high
winds. Driven by storm-force winds, water can enter homes through
usually rain-tight openings and completely devastate a home's interior
and contents. Ridge vents should be rated for water intrusion
resistance. Given that they are the last item installed, ridge vents can
be easily replaced. Look for a baf"e or trip that keeps water from
being pushed up into the vent so that the rain is pulled away. The vent
should be adequately fastened to the roof deck. Consider replacing
any off-ridge vents that are not rated for high-wind applications and
wind-driven rain resistance. Consult a reputable roofer in such cases.

Sof!ts
During a storm, the eaves of a home can expose the structure to the
ravages of wind-driven rain on two fronts. The most obvious danger
comes when sof!ts are blown
out during a storm. Water
intrusion can also occur when
strong winds drive water
through vented sof!ts.
Homeowners should check
the condition of their sof!t
covers (the plastic or
aluminum cover underneath
the roof edge in between the
eave and wall). If the sof!t is
damaged, it should be
replaced. Replace corroded
material covers. Check the
attachment to the wall and
eaves. Panels 12 inches or longer perpendicular to the wall should
have a wood support near the middle of the panel. To help anchor the
sof!ts of a home, apply a bead of polyurethane sealant between the
