About the Institute
for Catastrophic Loss Reduction

The Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction (ICLR), established in
1997, is a world-class centre for multidisciplinary disaster prevention
research and communication. ICLR is an independent, not-for-pro!t
research institute founded by the insurance industry and af!liated with
the University of Western Ontario.

The Institute’s mission is to reduce the loss of life and property caused
by severe weather and earthquakes through the identi!cation and
support of sustained actions that improve society’s capacity to adapt
to, anticipate, mitigate, withstand and recover from natural disasters.

ICLR’s mandate is to confront the alarming increase in disaster losses
caused by natural disasters and to work to reduce disaster deaths,
injuries and property damage. Disaster damage has been doubling
every !ve to seven years since the 1960s, an alarming trend. 

The greatest tragedy is that many disaster losses are preventable. 
ICLR is committed to the development and communication of disaster
prevention knowledge. For the individual homeowner, this translates
into the identi!cation of natural hazards that you and your home 
are vulnerable to. The Institute further informs individual homeowners
what steps may be followed to better protect your family and 
your home.

The purpose of this booklet is to outline steps that you can take
to protect your home from basement "ooding. Some of these
measures are simple and free; others cost money. All contribute to
reducing the risk of basement "ooding.
