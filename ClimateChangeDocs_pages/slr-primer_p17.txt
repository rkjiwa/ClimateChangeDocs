Atlantic Canada
More than 2.3 million people live in the Atlantic region, most of them in urban areas and smaller 
communities along the coastline.28 In 2001 it was estimated that over 60% of the population on the  
Atlantic Coast (including Quebec) lived within 5 km or less of the shoreline.29 

The largest region of high sensitivity to sea level rise is in Atlantic Canada and includes large parts of the 
coasts of Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick.30 In the Atlantic region, unlike other parts 
of Canada, the predicted effects of climate change, such as sea level rise and the increased occurrence 
and intensity of extreme weather events, are compounded in many coastal areas by post-glacial crustal 
subsidence. This increases coastal erosion and flooding, placing dikelands, coastal populations and their 
infrastructure and industries at risk.31

All four provinces have assumed a sea level rise of approximately one metre by the year 2100. This takes 
into consideration a component for the sinking or rising of the earth’s crust as the result of a rebound 
effect from the last ice age, including consideration of vertical land movement. There is considerable 
consistency in the analysis and documentation of issues amongst the four provinces. Nevertheless, the 
legal and policy framework for dealing with coastal zone planning and development varies for each 
Atlantic province. Newfoundland and Labrador is the only Atlantic jurisdiction which has set a province 
wide high water design standard for sea level rise, storm surge and wave action in coastal areas; it is 
set for a 1:100 year return period. The other Atlantic Provinces rely on the generally accepted coastal 
engineering design standards for the life of structures in coastal areas, which is assumed to be 50 years. 
One major exception to this standard is the Confederation Bridge between New Brunswick and Prince 
Edward Island, which was built one metre higher to account for  
sea level rise over the 100 year design life of the project.
