ADDRESSING CLIMATE AND HEALTH RISKS IN BC

CLIMATE CHANGE  
HEALTH RISKS

The World Health Organization has identified climate change as the biggest global health threat of the 21st century. 
Here in British Columbia, climate change is clearly observable and many people are already feeling its effects. With 
some degree of climate change now locked-in regardless of mitigation efforts, climate change adaptation is necessary 
to ensure British Columbia will fare well in the future. 

The challenge is significant, but British Columbia is well positioned to respond given strong capacity across different 
sectors. There are many specific actions that the larger health community can take to respond and prepare for climate 
change.  These actions often fall within the day-to-day responsibilities of the health care community and align with the 
sectorâ€™s overarching goal: improving health and well-being outcomes for all British Columbians.  

CLIMATE CHANGE AND HEALTH
Climate change is likely to impact 
most areas of our lives, including 
our health. In British Columbia, 
the principal hazards include 
rising temperatures, sea level 
rise, and increased frequency 
and intensity of extreme weather 
events. These hazards bring new 
and complex challenges, but by 
working together, we can increase 
our collective knowledge base and 
begin to think more strategically 
about how best to prepare to 
protect health. 

Population and community 
health are influenced by wider 
social, cultural, economic and 
environmental factors. These 
factors are commonly known as 
health determinants, and they are 
closely linked to a range of health 
outcomes. Increasingly, climate 
change hazards are impacting 
health determinants. As illustrated 
in the figure, these impacts in turn 
influence and affect physical and 
mental health outcomes.
