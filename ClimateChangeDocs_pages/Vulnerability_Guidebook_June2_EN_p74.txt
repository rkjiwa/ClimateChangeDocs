The first step in Worksheet 6.1 (Prioritize adaptation options) is to describe the process 
that will be used to prioritize the options created in chapter 5. This process will likely 
depend on the existing decision-making context. The second step is to list the prioritized 
adaptation options by SFM objective and describe why these adaptation options are 
priorities for implementation.

Worksheet 6.2 (Recommend priority adaptation options for implementation) provides 
guidance for assessing and selecting priority adaptation options to be implemented. 

Potential barriers and conflicts – For all of the adaptation options selected as having 
priority, potential conflicts with implementation must be assessed. This process involves 
considering the ecological suitability, social acceptability, and economic and institutional 
feasibility of the adaptations. In some cases, feasibility may be limited by identifiable 
barriers or constraints to adaptation (see Moser and Ekstrom 2010). For example, the 
uncertainty of adaptation success may be too high to justify implementation without 
further research. Such constraints should be noted and described, because the preferred 
adaptation option in such a case might be to remove or reduce the barriers and 
constraints. Infeasibility could also result from the social unacceptability of a potential 
adaptation option (e.g., introduction of exotic tree species at a large scale). 

If an adaptation option is deemed infeasible, it may be worth determining whether the 
option can be changed in a way that would make it feasible. If that possibility exists, then 
the adaptation option can be adjusted; otherwise, the adaptation option is rejected and 
alternatives should be sought. Priority adaptation options should also be assessed for 
conflicts with the achievement of other SFM objectives. 

Recommended adaptations – Once it has been determined that a particular 
suite of adaptation options will benefit SFM objectives, yield acceptable outcomes, 
and be feasible, then the adaptation options can be upgraded from “options” to 
“recommendations.” Keep in mind that adaptation options ranked as very important 
for achieving an SFM objective in a changing climate may not be the most suitable 
or the most feasible options. You may need to weigh the importance, or benefit, of 
implementing the option against the ease or difficulty of implementation. 

Timeframe for implementation –Determine the timeframe for implementation of the 
recommended option. Implementation timeframes may be related to existing opportunities 
(e.g., the start of a new forest management planning cycle), the status of the option as 
a “must-do” adaptation, the impending disappearance of a funding source to support 
the implementation, or other factors. Certain adaptation options may not need to be 
implemented immediately but can be delayed until the timing is right.

“Achievability” of SFM objectives  – Keep in mind that it may not be possible to reach 
all management objectives through adjustments to forest management policies and 
practices. Climate change will likely result in some impacts to forests which, regardless 
of the intensity of forest management efforts, will preclude the achievement of certain 
objectives. In these cases, the forest management objectives themselves should be 
revisited by asking the question, “With implementation of the recommended adaptations, 
do we expect to be able to achieve our SFM objectives?” If the answer is “no,” you should 
consider either identifying additional adaptations or revising your SFM objectives.
