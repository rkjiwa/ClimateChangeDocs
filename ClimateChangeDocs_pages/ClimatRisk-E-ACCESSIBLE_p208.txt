3.6 A PROGRESSIVE LOSS OF SEA ICE COVER

Warming temperatures will also affect sea ice cover (see Chapter 3). More specifically for Québec, 
a study of the marine estuary and Gulf of the St. Lawrence shows ice cover reductions between 1998 
and 2012. The freeze-up season is shorter than in the past despite the fact that interannual variability is 
quite high (Senneville et al., 2014). This same study showed that the proportion of maximum ice cover 
in the region diminished from approximately 47 % (1968-1998) to 36 % (1998-2013). 

These trends are likely to continue and projections indicate that freeze-up could arrive about 10-20 
days later while thawing could begin 20 to 30 days earlier by 2041-2070, compared to 1982-2011 in the 
Gulf of the St. Lawrence. In the Hudson Bay area, the ice-free season could extend up to two months 
longer towards mid-century. Other regions in Québec could also be affected however, existing studies 
on the subject do not make it possible to determine the magnitude of expected changes.

3.7 THAWING PERMAFROST

Québec’s northern region is located in an area of permafrost as illustrated in Figure 9. Permafrost is 
very sensitive to warming temperatures and changing precipitation patterns (see Chapter 3).

These conditions will affect the transportation sector at different levels. The following section 
will describe in more detail the main vulnerabilities for the different modes of transportation 
throughout Québec.
