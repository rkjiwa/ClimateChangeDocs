3.1 
The risk management process 
Risk management is a systematic approach to 
selecting the best course of action in uncertain 
situations by identifying, understanding, acting 
on and communicating risk issues.  In the 
context of adapting to climate change, risk 
management provides a framework for 
developing adaptation strategies in response to 
potential climate changes that create or increase 
risk.  As mentioned above, whether the issue is 
as large as large a municipal strategic plan for 
climate adaptation or a smaller study around 
specific issues such as extreme rainfall events, 
heat, health issues or others, the risk 
management process will Guide staff towards 
the optimal solutions. 
The framework presented in this Guide is based 
on the Canadian standard “Risk Management: 
Guidelines for Decision-makers” (CAN/CSA-
Q850-01).  The decision-making process 
consists of six steps, which are shown in Figure 
1.  The process emphasizes continuous 
communications with stakeholders and good 
documentation of each important action.

implementing risk reduction strategies in order to 
achieve acceptable levels of risk.  Key activities 
include: 

• 

•  Determining the probability and potential 

consequences of events arising from 
situations or hazards; 
Identifying actions that can be taken to avoid 
negative consequences or lessen their 
impact, or to exploit potential benefits; and  
•  Understanding stakeholders’ perceptions of 

probabilities and consequences. 

In practice, information relevant to risk situations 
can be interpreted differently by various groups 
of stakeholders, resulting in quite different 
perceptions of risk.  Given this, the risk 
management process emphasizes the need to 
understand how events might affect or be 
perceived by different stakeholders.   
The completion of each steps leads logically to 
the next, unless the risk issue is resolved, in 
which case the process is terminated.  Steps 
can be repeated to include different 
assumptions, new information or new analyses, 
as appropriate.  The decision options at the end 
of each step are indicated in the “Decision 
Diamond” shown in Figure 2.

The process is iterative and can be repeated as 
new information becomes available or new risk 
control options become feasible. 
The process emphasizes continuous 
stakeholder communications and careful 
documentation of all actions taken.  
Communications with all stakeholders, even 
marginal ones, ensures that stakeholders’ 
concerns are considered, and helps build 
support for the eventual results.  Complete
