(2014) ruled that “unprecedented flood water was to blame for the derailment,” and recommended 
more frequent bridge inspections, reduced train speeds in scour-prone areas, and investment and 
research into early-detection technologies for structures vulnerable to scour and erosion.

2.2 CLIMATE TRENDS AND FUTURE PROJECTIONS

This section provides a summary of projected climate conditions for 21st-century Canada, with a focus 
on climate elements of particular relevance to urban transportation. These include:

•  Greater variation and extremes in seasonal and annual air temperature; 

•  Changing precipitation patterns; 

• 

Increasing intensity and duration of wind speed, particularly during storm events;

•  Changing patterns of sea and lake ice; 

• 

Increasing permafrost degradation; 

•  Changing water levels, along both coastal and inland waterways; and,

•  Combinations of these changing climate elements.
