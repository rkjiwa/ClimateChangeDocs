An event for people across sectors and communities to 
share information about climate change adaptation-related 
initiatives in Yukon.  

This project will provide an understanding of the impacts of

This project aims to improve understanding of the 
importance of self/family, community, and territory food 
sufficiency and sovereignty in the face of changing climate 
and to inform Yukon strategies and policies with respect to 
climate change adaptation for local food systems.  

Providing a tool for Yukon Highways and Public Works 
(HPW) to proactively consider threats to the Dempster 
Highway from the melt of massive ice-bodies.  

Supporting Yukon government’s capacity to advance 
Climate Change Preparedness in the North funded climate 
change adaptation initiatives within and outside
