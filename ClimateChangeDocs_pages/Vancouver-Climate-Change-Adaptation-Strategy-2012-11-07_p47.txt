table 10: examples of impacts where high vulnerability was identified

impact
increased health and safety risks to vulnerable populations during extreme heat events
increased surface water flooding from ponding of rainfall in low lying areas or heavy 
rainfall overcoming the capacity of drainage system
increases in private property sewer back-ups in combined sewer areas due to high  
rainfall volume in the sewer system

increased flooding along the Coast and Fraser river as sea level rises and the storm 
surge and waves breach height of land

Consequence rating

Water supply shortages felt in late summer 
due to a decreased spring snow pack and 
higher summer temps influencing greater 
draw downs and evaporation could result in 
increased costs for water and imperative  
conservation measures
increased health and safety risks to vulnerable 
populations during extreme heat events
increased surface water flooding from 
ponding of rainfall in low lying areas or heavy 
rainfall overcoming the capacity of drainage 
system 
increase in number of combined sewer  
overflows
