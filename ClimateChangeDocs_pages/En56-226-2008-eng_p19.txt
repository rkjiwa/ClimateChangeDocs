INTRODUCTION 

consume more and extensively develop on floodplains and
vulnerable  coasts.  Sustainable,  low-emission  development
actions  occur  at  two  different  levels:  first,  large  collective
decisions that will determine the framework within which we
adapt  and  mitigate,  including  urban  form,  land  use,
transportation infrastructure, energy and water systems; and
second, cultural, social and psychological dimensions of values,
lifestyle and consumption behaviour (Robinson, 2008).

Working  toward  resilient  and  sustainable  communities 
will  require  promoting  climate  change  responses  within
sustainable  development  strategies  and  actions.  However,
even if we achieve low GHG emissions globally, we will still
experience changes in climate due to the presence of historical
emissions, therefore, actions that help us adapt to climate
change are necessary. 

Responses to climate change: adaptation
and mitigation 
There  have  been  two  main  responses  to  climate  change:
mitigation and adaptation. In the context of climate change,
mitigation  is  defined  as  “implementing  policies  to  reduce
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and enhance sinks”, while
adaptation to climate change is defined as, “[an] adjustment in
natural  or  human  systems  in  response  to  actual  or  expected
climatic stimuli or their effects, which moderates harm or exploits
beneficial  opportunities”  (IPCC  2007).  There  is  increasing
recognition  that  the  world’s  current  progress  on  reducing
greenhouse gas emissions is not occurring rapidly enough to avoid
impacts from climate change in the coming century. Because of
this, the world is “committed” to a certain level of global warming
and therefore, subject to a degree of impacts that will require
adaptive responses by nations and communities.  Examples of
types of adaptation are listed in Table 2.
