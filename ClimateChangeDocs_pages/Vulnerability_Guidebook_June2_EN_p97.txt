7.2  Worksheets for Chapter 2

The following worksheets provide guidance on describing and documenting how climate 
has shaped current forest conditions and management practices in your SFM area. They 
also provide guidance for documenting any adaptations to changes in forest condition 
that you may have already implemented. The first three worksheets facilitate the gathering 
of climate information and the identification of relationships between climate and 
forests. The fourth worksheet is provided for listing and describing knowledge gaps and 
uncertainties that arise during the assessment.

Worksheet 2.1  Describe the climatic conditions and trends 
 

Table 2.1  Climate data: normals and trends

Worksheet 2.2 

 

 Describe the relationships among climate, forest conditions, and 
forest management practices
Table 2.2   Relationships among current climate, forest conditions, and 

forest management practices

Worksheet 2.3 

 

 Describe how recent climate trends or changes in forest conditions 
have led to changes in forest management practices
Table 2.3   Recent changes to forest management plans or practices as a 

result of changes in forest conditions

Worksheet 2.4 
 

Identify uncertainties and knowledge gaps
Table 2.4   Key uncertainties and knowledge gaps about climate, 

forest conditions, or future scenarios identified during the 
vulnerability assessment process

Worksheet 2.1.   Describe climatic conditions and trends

2.1-A.     Climate records
Gather information to describe recent climate trends and climate variability in your 
management area.

Climate and climate-related variables – The variables listed in this worksheet are 
suggestions of climate factors that might be used to describe the “exposure” of the SFM 
system of interest. The list includes information that is readily available for locations 
across Canada. You may delete or add variables to reflect local conditions and available 
information.

Historical trends – Trends refer to changes in climatic factors at a given location over a 
specified time period. 

Climate normals – Average climate conditions are calculated from recorded climatic 
values for a given location over a specified period. A period of 30 consecutive years (e.g., 
1971–2000) is the standard for calculating climate normals in Canada.
