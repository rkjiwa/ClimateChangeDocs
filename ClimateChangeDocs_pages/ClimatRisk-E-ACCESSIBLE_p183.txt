In some parts of the province, ice blowing into locks delays the opening of the navigation season. This 
impact may be reduced by using ice curtains (which restrict ice moving into locks) and air bubblers 
(including compressors and fuel). However, as ice cover decreases throughout the 21st century, issues 
posed by ice breakup should become less problematic for operators. 

Table 6 provides an overview of the impacts and adaptations identified in this section.

Table 6: Climate risk factors discussed in relation to their impacts on marine transportation. 

Climate/environmental  

risk factors:

Warmer air temperature 

(summer and winter; 

more variability)

Impacts and benefits

Adaptation actions

• 

Lower water levels on fresh-water 
navigable watercourses (i.e. 
Great Lakes), leading to increased 
costs/more trips

•  Changes to navigation 

procedures; channel dredging; 
flow augmentation 

•  Reduced ice accumulation on 
vessels and rigging (opportunity)

• 

Longer shipping season due 
to longer ice-free period 
(opportunity)

Precipitation (changing 

•  Disruption to shipping schedules

seasonal patterns, 

increasing intensity and 

extremes)

Changing patterns of lake 

and sea ice

Wind (changes in 

average wind speeds 

and extremes)

• 

Flash-flooding of inland waterways

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

Increased shipping hazards due 
to longer period of ice pack 
weakness (ex. increased wave 
action, storm surge, etc.)

Lengthened summer shipping 
season, emergence of new 
shipping routes (opportunity)

Lengthened season for use of float 
planes (opportunity)
Short-term water level fluctuations 
from sustained winds (Shlozberg et 
al, 2014)

Increased difficulty of ship 
handling
 Seiche flood events

•  Decreased shipping capacity in 
GLSLS; more frequently-restricted 
channels

• 

• 

Seasonal shift in shipping practices

Flow management improvements 

•  Greater investment in ice-

management equipment and 
resources

•  No adaptations identified in the 

literature

•  No adaptations identified in the 

literature

•  Relocation/flood-proofing of port 

infrastructure

•  Modal shift of freight to road, rail, 

and air

Changes in water levels 

•  More difficult access to shoreline 

• 

(lakes, rivers, ocean)

marine infrastructure

E-Nav and “under-keel 
optimization” technologies

•  Port flooding and infrastructure 

damage from storm surges

• 

• 

Increased dredging of channels 

Investment in flood-proofing at 
technologies (i.e. breakwaters 
and dikes)
