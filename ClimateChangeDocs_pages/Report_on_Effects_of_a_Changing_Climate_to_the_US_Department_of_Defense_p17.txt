 

in the future.  Seven sites not currently vulnerable to wildfires were considered vulnerable in the 
future. A number of installations are subject to more than one vulnerability, most notably 
recurrent flooding, drought, and wildfires. 
 

It is relevant to point out that “future” in this analysis means only 20 years in the future.  

Projected changes will likely be more pronounced at the mid-century mark; vulnerability 
analyses to mid- and late-century would likely reveal an uptick in vulnerabilities (if adaptation 
strategies are not implemented.) 
 

The Department considers resilience in the installation planning and basing processes to 
include impacts on built and natural infrastructure.  This includes consideration of environmental 
vulnerabilities in installation master planning, management of natural resources, design and 
construction standards, utility systems/service, and emergency management operations. 
 

Climate and environmental resilience efforts span all levels and lines of effort, and are 

not framed as a separate program.  Additionally, resources for assessing and responding to 
climate impacts are provided within existing DoD missions, funds, and capabilities and 
subsumed under existing risk management processes.  The Military Departments provide most of 
the resources for on-the-ground activities in the Geographic Combatant Commands.
