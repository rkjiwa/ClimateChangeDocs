EXAMPLES OF IMPACTS ON AIR 

TRANSPORT

① Flooding of airport runways/taxiways, 
and damage to airport structures and 
equipment

② Damage to runways, taxiways 

③ Damage to terminals and navigation 

equipment

④ Decreased traction on runways

⑤ Reduced “lift” in aircraft during take-off 
(plane requires more fuel or must carry 
less weight)  

⑥ Aircraft not able to take-off or land 

⑦ Operational impacts (equipment 

malfunction and failure, occupational 
health and safety issues)

⑧ Increased use of pavement de-icers 
(runways) Increased use of aircraft  
de-icing and anti-icing 

MARINE TRANSPORT 

CLIMATE FACTOR(S)

 • Extreme precipitation (heavy rainfall) and associated 

standing water

 • Storm surges/sea level rise in coastal areas 
 • High temperatures (pavement softening, rutting, 

flushing, bleeding)

 • Freeze-thaw cycles (pavement deformation, shearing, 

deterioration)  

 • Warming and thawing of permafrost (ground 

settlement, slope instability, drainage issues, cracking) 

 • Extreme precipitation (weakened embankments, 

depressions)

 • High winds
 • Extreme precipitation
 • Extreme precipitation
 • Freezing rain
 • Extreme high temperatures

 • Extreme fog (low visibility)
 • Wind (strong cross-winds/tailwinds affect some runways)
 • Extreme temperatures (heat and cold)

 • Changing precipitation conditions

The impacts illustrated in Figure 5 can disrupt marine transportation and compromise the efficiency 
of port and shipping activities. For example, lower water levels on inland waterways can reduce 
the cost-effectiveness of marine shipping by decreasing the capacity of vessels, and result in a shift 
to other ports or other modes of transportation. Hazards to marine navigation from changing ice 
conditions and storm events can pose safety risks. Ports along Canada’s Atlantic and Pacific coasts 
are subject to impacts from sea level rise and storm surges, and some may also be vulnerable to 
coastal erosion. Warming temperatures can result in opportunities for marine transport, including a 
longer operating season and potentially open up shipping routes in Arctic waters, however, this is 
tempered by continuing challenges to navigation and safety posed by mobile summer sea ice and 
older, thicker ice.
