EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

There is considerable science-based evidence that the global climate is changing, with 
increasing overall temperatures, increasing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, 
and altered patterns of precipitation. The Lancet Commission (2015) speaks to the many and 
serious impacts of climate change on health, and how addressing these could be “the greatest 
global health opportunity of the 21st century”. Extreme weather events and increased 
climate variability associated with climate change exacerbate current public health challenges 
globally, and present new risks to populations. For Canada, various effects of climate change 
play a significant compounding factor that negatively affects the health and resilience of 
vulnerable communities. Notable direct and indirect impacts include:

•  Droughts and flooding and the links with incidence of water-borne diseases and to 

psychosocial effects

•  Food security and the nutritional status of individuals, which further undermine resistance 

to diseases

•  Heat-related morbidity and mortality as well as compounding health issues related to poor 

air quality such as asthma, allergies, respiratory diseases, cancer, cardiovascular diseases 
and stroke 

•  The spread of disease vectors favouring the emergence and re-emergence of infectious 

diseases

•  Natural disasters and the loss of land, cultural heritage, natural resources and property with 

significant impact on mental health and well-being

•  Special challenges and impacts on northern Canadians such as dangerous travel, damaged 
infrastructure, threats to traditional food sources, disappearance of drinking water sources 
and related psychosocial and cultural impacts

•  Sustainable healthcare in a changing climate presents future risks to Canadians as its 

capacity is strained in various ways (aging population, resource intensive infrastructure, 
budget constraints)
