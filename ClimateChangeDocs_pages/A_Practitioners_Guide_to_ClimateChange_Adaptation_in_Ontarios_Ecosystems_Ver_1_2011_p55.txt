 

STEP 6: 

 

 
IMPLEMENT AND MAINSTREAM ADAPTATION 

 
 
 
 

 

In  Step 6, the adaptation measures that have been  evaluated and selected  are considered for implementation. While this is a final 
step in the process, the elements of this step form a critical part of a broader adaptive management process that has no end  point. 
Over time, as measures are implemented and adaptation is mainstreamed into policies and programs, monitoring, acquisition of new 
knowledge, and periodic re-assessments will be required.  

 

 

Implementing Adaptation Measures 

Once  priority  adaptation  measures  have  been  selected 
(refer  to  Step  5),  the  project  team  should  identify  who  is 
responsible  for  implementation  and  who  will  fund  those 
measures  that  have  fiscal  implications.  This  step  also 
identifies  opportunities  to  integrate  adaptive  responses 
into  existing  programs.  As  part  of  this  process,  the  team 
must  also  establish  the  timing  of  the  implementation  and 
develop  a  plan  for  how  the  actions  will  be  measured, 
monitored,  and  evaluated.  Sometimes,  it  is  only  through 
the team’s effort to implement adaptive measures that key 
limitations in adaptive capacity become evident. 

the 

In  some  cases, 
implementation  of  adaptation 
measures may lend itself to development of an adaptation 
plan, with goals, objectives, targets, and actions. In other 
cases,  adaptation  measures  can  be  implemented  and 
mainstreamed into existing plan and programs.
