RAIL INDUSTRY APPROACH TO CLIMATE CHANGE (MICHAEL GULLO, RAILWAY ASSOCIATION OF 
CANADA, PERSONAL COMMUNICATION, 2015)

Railway capital investments address a variety of issues and challenges, including how extreme 
weather events such as flash flooding, avalanches, washouts, and freezing, can lead to service 
disruptions within and around the railway network.  To ensure the efficient movement of traffic, 
railways invest significantly in track infrastructure upgrades, execute seasonal readiness plans, 
test natural hazard warning systems, undertake regular rail inspections, and ensure processes 
are in place to mitigate against, and to recover from, severe weather situations. A variety of 
technologies are applied to determine the status of rail infrastructure and the landscape it 
traverses, including:

•  Radar interferometer to measure track stability,

•  Vulnerability assessment of risk area and GIS mapping,

•  Landslide mapping; temporal and spatial,

•  Geotechnical assessment of slopes,

•  Laser movement detection system,

•  Fiber optic detection for slope movement,

•  River hydraulic studies; and,

•  Beaver dam assessment and management.

For planning and operations, the rail sector generally uses short-term weather forecasts/
considerations, rather than long-term climate projections.  Rail companies are concerned about 
climate change in terms of the potential for more frequent and/or intense severe weather 
phenomena, as these may cause catastrophic risk to the railway network and its operations. 
The Railway Association of Canada and the American Association of Railroads have both 
established Environment Committees that include extreme and inclement weather events within 
their mandates.

As with other transportation modes, the rail sector requires a scientific and fact-based approach 
to help them identify where climate change impacts are expected to occur in the short, 
medium and long term.  With this knowledge, adaptation efforts within the sector can be 
targeted, and ultimately more strategic.
