FLOODING, GREATER TORONTO AREA, JULY 2005 AND JULY 2013

Several extreme summer storm events have caused substantial disruption and damage to the Greater 
Toronto Area (GTA). In August 2005, intense rainfall and flooding cost the City of Toronto $47 million 
(insurance covered the additional $500 million in damages) (McLeod, 2011). One major culvert on 
Finch Avenue sustained $4 million in damages due to wash-out (City of Toronto, 2014; McLeod, 2011; 
see Figure 7).

Similarly, during a severe storm in July 2013, 126mm of rain fell on the GTA within two hours, resulting in 
$850 million in insurance claims (Environment Canada, 2014). While the hourly rate of rainfall (intensity) 
was higher during this event than during Hurricane Hazel, damage was significantly less severe due in 
part to improvements in Ontario’s emergency planning policy framework after Hazel (Henstra, 2011; 
Aulakh, 2013). Transportation disruption was significant nonetheless. Subways were closed due to 
flooding, GO trains were evacuated by police boats, and drivers faced washed-out roads. However, 
transportation networks in the city were almost completely restored by the following day (CBC News, 
2013). A number of adaptive actions were identified in the aftermath of this crisis, including the 
development of more robust flood management and prevention plans for the Don Valley, and the 
installation of emergency back-up power at key bus and locomotive maintenance facilities.  

CALGARY FLOOD, JUNE 2013

An important final example relates to the flooding of the Bow River in Calgary, Alberta in June 2013. At 
the storm’s peak, 200mm of rain fell within approximately 16 hours on supersaturated soil and, in some 
places, still-frozen ground (Davison and Powers, 2013). As Canada’s costliest climate-related disaster 
to date, damages in Calgary are estimated to surpass $6 billion. Damage included bridges, culverts, 
roads (over 1,000 km) and public transit infrastructure (Environment Canada, 2014). In addition, scour 
(the removal of supporting earth by fast-moving water) caused the Bonnybrook Bridge to partially 
collapse, leaving six Canadian Pacific Railway freight cars hanging over the Bow River; shortly 
thereafter, the bridge was de-commissioned (Canadian Press, 2014). The Transportation Safety Board
