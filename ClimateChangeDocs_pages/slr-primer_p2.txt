This Primer is a resource for coastal management authorities (mainly local governments) to help 
them identify and evaluate options for adapting to the impacts of sea level rise and associated 
hazards. The Primer is intended to be relevant for southern coastal regions across Canada with 
application to British Columbia, Quebec, and the Atlantic region.
