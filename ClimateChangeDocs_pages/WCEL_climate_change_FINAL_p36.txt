DPAs for energy and water conservation may also establish restrictions on the type and place-
ment of trees and other vegetation in proximity to the buildings and other structures in order 
to provide for the conservation of energy, which can be considered in the context of reducing 
the heat island effect in urban areas.

DPAs  can  be  used  together  with  complementary  measures  such  as  servicing  requirements, 
development cost charges and other local government tools to achieve climate change adap-
tation objectives.

Some examples of how DPAs can be used to address climate change impacts:

•	

Interface wildfire hazards:

•	 The City of Langford prepared a study that discusses local government powers 
and practices with respect to managing wildfire hazards, and includes a model 
DPA. www.cityoflangford.ca/assets/Documents~Library/Brochures/fire-hazard-
planning-model.pdf

•	 The District of Elkford Wildfire DPA includes requirements for pre-development 
hazard and risk assessments, that FireSmart building materials and construction 
practices be used, and that new developments include roads and trails that 
can function as firebreaks and access corridors. http://elkford.ca/include/get.

•	 The City of Williams Lake OCP has a Wildfire Interface DPA with comprehensive 

guidelines for development that recognize the risks in forested communities. 
The guidelines note that climate change is one of the factors that may alter the 
fire hazard over time. www.williamslake.ca/files/1/doc_OCP_Final_Chapter_7_
Development_Permit_Areas.pdf

•	

Steep slope hazards:

•	 The District of North Vancouver is proposing several Natural Hazards DPAs 
including one for slope hazards that will minimize development on steep 
slopes, manage development on and near steep slopes, and ensure on-going 
maintenance and monitoring of steeply sloped lands. www.dnv.org/article.

•	 Water shortages / increased precipitation:

•	 The Resort Municipality of Whistler, Water Conservation Area (draft OCP, November 

2011): DPA includes requirements for landscaping, using drought-tolerant, native 
vegetation, adequate topsoil to assist in infiltration, rainwater capture systems, 
onsite use of stormwater, maximizing pervious surfaces and measures like 
bioswales and rain gardens. www.whistler2010.com/pdf/maps11-15/Draft%20
Development%20Permit%20Area%20Guidelines.pdf

•	 The City of Castlegar, Energy, Water and GHG Reduction Development Permit Area:  

DPA requires a landscape plan prepared by a qualified professional that includes 
hydrozones, site grading that minimizes disruption of natural drainage patterns, 
stormwater best management practices, and the use of native vegetation and 
xeriscaping. See www.castlegar.ca/pdfs/OCP_Bylaw_1150.pdf

DPAs of most interest 
with respect to climate 
change adaptation 
measures are likely 
protection of the 
natural environment, 
protection of 
the community 
from hazardous 
conditions on land, 
and establishing 
objectives to promote 
conservation of 
water and energy.
