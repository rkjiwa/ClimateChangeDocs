and implement the measures necessary to reduce vulnerability to climate change and 
thus to increase the likelihood that SFM objectives will be achieved. Therefore, the 
fundamental goals of adaptation and SFM are the same.  

Adaptation is often implemented at a local or regional scale, and it can be enabled by 
institutions and policies that support adaptation actions. The need for adaptation within 
forest management varies across ecosystems and is related to the vulnerability of SFM 
systems relative to their ability to achieve SFM objectives under a changing climate. Tools 
and knowledge that allow forest resource professionals operating at various scales to 
understand climate change and to effectively and efficiently adapt to potential impacts 
are required. The CCFM has addressed this need, in part, through its “Adapting Sustainable 
Forest Management to Climate Change” report series (see Edwards and Hirsch 2012), 
which outlines a comprehensive approach to understanding and adapting SFM to climate 
change. The current guidebook is part of the series and provides a “how to” tool for 
applying the CCFM adaptation framework described by Williamson et al. (2012). 

What is Sustainable Forest Management? 

Forests provide significant ecological, economic, 
social, and cultural benefits to Canadians. As 
development pressures on forest resources have 
mounted over time, the need for a concept of forest 
management that ensures conservation of healthy 
forests for future generations, while allowing 
for a balanced, equitable, and efficient flow of 
ecological, economic, social, and cultural benefits 
for current generations, has become apparent. The 
concept of sustainable forest management (SFM) 
was developed in response to this need. SFM has 
now been embraced by forest managers across 
Canada. Furthermore, demonstrating adherence to 
the principles of SFM has become an international 
requirement, both through international 
agreements, such as the Montréal Process  
(see www.montrealprocess.org), and through 
various forest management processes, such as 
certification. 

To implement SFM and to ascertain whether it was 
being achieved, a clear definition of the concept 
and a mechanism or tool to monitor and measure 
progress toward it were required. The Canadian 
Council of Forest Ministers (CCFM) therefore 
developed a national framework of criteria and 

indicators to meet these dual requirements (CCFM 
2006). This framework sets out six criteria for 
achieving SFM: 

Criterion 1.  Biological diversity 
Criterion 2. 

 Ecosystem condition and 
productivity

Criterion 3.  Soil and water
Criterion 4.  Role in global ecological cycles 
Criterion 5.  Economic and social benefits
Criterion 6.  Society’s responsibility 

Managing forests according to these six criteria is 
far from the largely timber-focused management 
approach of the past. Instead, SFM works to address 
and balance a wide range of ecological, economic, 
social, and cultural considerations so that the 
needs and expectations of all forest users may be 
met today and in the future. This comprehensive 
approach requires more than just dealing with 
the immediate challenges of the day; it also 
requires working to predict long-term trends so 
that Canadians can plan how best to maintain the 
health and well-being of the country’s forests and 
forest economy.
