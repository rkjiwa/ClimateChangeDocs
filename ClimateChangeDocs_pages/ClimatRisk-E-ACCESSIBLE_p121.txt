2.0 OVERVIEW OF TRANSPORTATION IN THE PRAIRIES

The Prairies’ transportation network is extensive, with road, rail, and aviation providing options for 
the movement of people and freight. While the Prairies’ surface transportation network supports 
significant marine activity in other Canadian regions, marine transportation plays a smaller role in 
the Prairies. Canada’s only Arctic port is located at Churchill, Manitoba. In 2016, due to reductions 
in the volume of grain being moved through the port, the owner of the Port of Churchill, OmniTRAX, 
announced the closure of the port for grain shipments. Currently, the port remains open for resupply 
to Nunavut. Figure 2 presents a visual overview of major transportation infrastructure in the Prairies.

the National Road Network depicted in this figure includes winter roads.

2.1 ROAD TRANSPORTATION

The Prairies have a relatively high number of road-km per capita due to an extensive municipal and 
provincial road network, and a lower population density than the national average (3.3 versus 3.7 
persons per km2) (Statistics Canada, 2011). The Prairies account for 47 percent of Canada’s public 
roads, although this drops to 26 percent if only paved roads are considered (Transport Canada, 
2015). Saskatchewan accounts for almost half (48 percent) of the region’s total road-km (295,100 km), 
Alberta ranks second with 228,600 km (37 percent of Prairie road-km), followed by Manitoba, with 
91,700 km (15 percent) (Transport Canada, 2015). Figure 3 demonstrates the extent of the Prairies’ 
road network.
