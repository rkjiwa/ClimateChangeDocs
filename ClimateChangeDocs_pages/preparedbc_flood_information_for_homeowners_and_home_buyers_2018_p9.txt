After a flood

Following a flood, it is important to restore your home as soon as 
possible to protect your health and prevent further property damage. 
While cleaning up you should: 

  Be aware of areas where floodwaters have receded, keeping an 

eye out for debris. 

  Be aware that floodwaters often erode roads and walkways, 

making them less stable.

  Never drive through areas that are still flooded.

  Avoid standing water as it may be electrically charged from 

underground or downed power lines.

  Photograph damage to your property and speak to your 

insurance agent.
