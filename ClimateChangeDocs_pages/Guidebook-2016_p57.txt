This category includes historical climate information that comes from observed climate data along with 
projected mean future changes that are simulated from climate models. 
The climate information included in this category is generally produced for large areas and long time periods. 
Coarse spatial and temporal scales and resolutions make this type of information relevant to a large number 
of users. It represents the type of information more readily available in summary reports and on websites. 
Five examples are presented to highlight how past and future climate information can be tailored using 
varying formats. From the simplest format to the slightly more complex, they are:

Synthesis table – used to present both past and future changes

Climate normals – used to present climatic averages (e.g. 30-year)

Historical trends – used to present long-term evolution of the past climate

Delta changes 

• Global maps –  used to present projected changes on a global scale
• Regional maps – used to present projected changes on a smaller spatial scale
