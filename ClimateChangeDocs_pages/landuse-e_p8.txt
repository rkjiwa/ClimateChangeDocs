2.1 OFFICIAL PLANS

An official plan is a formal planning document, often 
required by provincial law, that sets out a comprehensive 
long-term vision and the goals and objectives for the 
development of a community.7 Preparing such a plan 
typically begins with expert analyses of local conditions 
and includes public consultations as well as reviews by local 
advisory committees and provincial and other authorities. 
After the plan is finalized, the local council adopts it 
formally by enacting a bylaw. Provincial approval may be 
required as well. 

Also entitled general, community or master plans, these 
documents identify the major social, economic and 
environmental challenges facing the community and 
articulate strategies to address them. Official plans are 
in force for a relatively long period (10 years or longer) 
with updates required periodically (every five years in 
some provinces). They may designate some areas of the 
community as appropriate locations for new growth 

while others are to be preserved or revitalised. Official 
plans serve as guiding documents for subsequent local 
policies, programs and bylaws (such as zoning codes and 
subdivision controls).

Climate change adaptation can be incorporated directly 
into a municipality’s official plan, either in a dedicated 
section or embedded throughout the document. Such 
texts normally detail local climate change risks and 
opportunities, an overarching adaptation vision and policy, 
as well as priority adaptation needs. Adaptation strategies 
and actions in official plans include mainstreaming 
adaptation into all or selected municipal operations, 
undertaking a comprehensive municipal risk assessment 
process to prioritize risks and opportunities, developing 
a comprehensive municipal adaptation action plan, or 
obtaining critical information or technical data for making 
effective and appropriate adaptation decisions.

Iqaluit’s General Plan8
Iqaluit (population 6200), the capital of Nunavut, is one of the first Canadian communities to integrate climate 
change adaptation into its General Plan. One of the five priority vision statements identifies Iqaluit as “a community 
that adapts to climate change.” The plan sets out two high-level objectives to realize this vision: (1) to study the 
impacts of climate change on the community and (2) to adopt policies that recognize the long-term impacts of 
climate change. The plan includes more detail on the climate change issues of concern to the community (for 
example, increases in temperature and precipitation, permafrost thaw, decreases in sea ice, and accelerated coastal 
erosion) and priority adaptation actions related to municipal infrastructure.
