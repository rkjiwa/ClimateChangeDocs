A 2009 hazard and risk analysis for the Regional District of Nanaimo identified 
long term risks related to water supply, increased incidence and severity of 
flooding due to increased precipitation and run-off, and potential compounding 
effects of greater storm surges due to sea level rise, high tides, and increased 
precipitation. Changing weather patterns might also be increasing the risk of 
devastating ice storms similar to those previously experienced in Eastern Canada 
that cut off power supplied from the grid. www.rdn.bc.ca/cms/wpattachments/

Increased risk of forest fire, and potential for larger fires of higher intensity. The Kelowna 
area fires of 2003, exacerbated by drought and long periods of hot weather, caused 
$700 million in damage. http://act-adapt.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/PDF-

After the heat wave of 2005, Toronto identified heat stress as a major climate change 
impact for its community. http://act-adapt.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/PDF-

To consider:

•	

The anticipated frequency and or severity (or both) of extreme weather events and other 
climate-related hazards experienced by a community may increase as result of climate 
change. This in turn means greater demands for personnel, training, equipment, public 
education, etc. Emergency management teams have not traditionally viewed impacts 
as climate change-related and will likely require training to ensure they understand the 
concept and its implications, as well as new response mechanisms and planning. Local 
governments also need to look at the implications for insurance costs and coverage.

The Cariboo-Chilcotin adaptation strategy recommends that human resources 
capacity for emergency services be increased at times in the year when that 
region is most at risk: the wildfire season and during spring freshet. It also 
suggests temporarily reassigning other staff to emergency services during peak 
times and providing necessary training. http://pacificclimate.org/sites/default/
files/publications/RAC.CCCCAdaptationStrategy.Sep2011.pdf

Communications needs will likely be increased, for example to advise the 
community about evacuation notices, water quality issues, road closures, etc. 
There may be opportunities to expand communication capacity through the use 
of social media.

Emergency staff themselves may be affected during extreme heat events, and this 
needs to be taken into consideration in emergency response planning.

The BC Provincial Emergency Program (PEP) has a tool to assess community 
preparedness for emergencies. www.pep.gov.bc.ca/cepr/review.html
