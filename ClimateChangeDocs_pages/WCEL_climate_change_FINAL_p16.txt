Impacts in some regions could include…

Transportation 

•	 More travel disruptions associated with landslides, road washouts, flooding, 

•	
•	
•	

ice jams and wildfires
Increased road surface damage from higher temperatures 
Increased frequency of freeze-thaw cycles and damage to roads
Increased maintenance requirements and brushfires for roadside and median 
strip vegetation

•	 Potential reductions in water-based navigation due to lower summer stream 

flows

•	 Need for alternate modes of transportation of food/medical supplies to 

communities that rely on ice roads for access in winter

•	 Milder winter weather leading to reductions in motor vehicle accidents 

•	

•	

Increased risk of windstorms, forest fires, storm surges, landslides, 
snowstorms, ice jams, hail and floods
Increased demands on storm water management systems with the potential 
for more combined storm water and sewer overflows, and need to explore 
integrated storm water management practices

Infrastructure

•	 Reduced effectiveness of sea walls as a result of sea level rise
•	 Need for new or upgraded flood control and erosion control structures or 

alternative strategies

•	 Need for retrofit upgrades of existing vulnerable infrastructure, including 

port facilities, transportation network, electricity and communications 
distribution infrastructure

•	 Potential for more green infrastructure and low impact development due to 

greater resilience to climate change impacts offered by these practices

•	

Increased erosion or damage to coastal infrastructure, dunes, beaches, and 
other natural features due to sea level rise and storm surge

•	 Loss of coastal wetlands and other coastal habitats due to sea level rise and 

•	

increased storm surges contributing to erosion
Increased costs for maintenance and expansion of coastal erosion control 
(natural or man-made)

•	 Saltwater intrusion into coastal aquifers 
•	 Potential increased risk of pollution from coastal industrial sites due to sea 

level rise

•	 Loss of cultural and historical sites on coastline due to sea level rise and 

related impacts

•	 Coastal squeeze implications, i.e. loss of coastal habitat in areas where 

man-made defensive structures or natural features form a barrier along the 
coast that prevents the landward movement of ecosystems and habitats in 
response to sea level rise
Increased salinity of low-lying farmland
