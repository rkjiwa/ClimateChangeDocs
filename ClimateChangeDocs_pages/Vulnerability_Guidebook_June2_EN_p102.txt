Worksheet 2.3.   Describe how recent climate trends or 

changes in forest conditions have led to 
changes in forest management practices

The aim of this worksheet is to highlight your organizationâ€™s ability to adapt to new 
conditions. Climate change may already be influencing the forest ecosystem, and you may 
already be adapting policies and practices in response to these influences. If you have 
not yet noticed any changes to forest conditions in your area, there may be other factors 
unrelated to climate that have caused you to alter forest management plans or practices 
(e.g., changing markets). 

Table 2.3.      Recent changes to forest management plans or practices as a result of changes in 

forest conditions

Recent changes to forest 
conditions and processes

Description of change  
in forest condition 

Description of changes  
in forest management 

Example: Climate (or weather) has 
been drier and hotter for the past 
decade, leading to increases in fire 
severity and area burned.

Example: An increase in wildfire 
has led to greater mortality of trees 
(reduced timber supply), a reduction 
in conifer forest area (change in 
composition), and an increase in 
younger forests (altered age classes). 

Example: Changes caused by wildfire have 
led to increased salvaging operations, 
increased fire-fighting capacities and 
capabilities, and changes in allowable 
annual cut.
