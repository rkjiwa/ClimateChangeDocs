Yukon ‘State of Play’:  
Analysis of Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation 
 
Our focus on further opportunities for adaptation has been guided by four questions: 

November 14, 2017 

  Are the risks of not taking further adaptation action significant? 

  Are there possible economic benefits from the adaptation action itself? 

  Will Yukon regret doing this if the climate threat does not materialize?  

 

Is this action a win for Yukon communities even if the climate threat turns out to not be a 
severe as some scenarios projected? 

We have also attempted to explicitly highlight where the suggested adaptation opportunities 
might intersect with other issues and opportunities in Yukon (e.g. Fire Smart and biomass heat). 
Adaptation opportunities and efforts are rarely stand-alone issues.
