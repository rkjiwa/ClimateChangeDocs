On December 15, 2006, the biggest windstorm 
in more than forty years roared through 
Vancouver, causing significant damage to 
Stanley Park. This was followed by two major 
windstorms in January 2007. As a result of the 
storms, approximately 10,000 trees fell (5–10% 
of all trees in the park) and there was severe 
damage to about 40 hectares of the forest. 
A bibliography of tree–wind literature is 
available from www.treelink.org.24

Figure 7: Flooding can cause erosion along streambanks

and precipitation conditions on a site. This 
creates stress on individual trees, and reduces 
the geographic range or extent of the species as 
trees growing in vulnerable locations succumb to 
drought, pests or disease. Some species will be 
better at adjusting than others.

Extreme weather events affect urban forests. 
Climate change could result in more frequent 
extreme windstorm events, with more trees 
blown over and large branches broken. 
Homeowners often remove tall trees from 
their property for fear of wind damage. Major 
snowstorms are also causing trees to lose limbs 
to heavy snow.

Flooding can cause erosion of soils along 
streambanks, undermining trees and their roots. 
Flooding is projected to become both more 
intense and more frequent as a result of climate 
change, inhibiting the early-successional riparian 
regrowth that occurs on islands and low areas 
susceptible to inundation. Lowland riparian 
woodlands, stream health and fisheries will suffer 
as a result.

A Role for Urban Forests 
All of these climate change effects impact 
people, ecosystems, economic well-being, 
and quality of life. Sections 3 and 4 of this 
guide provide some suggestions on ways that 
communities can use urban forests to adjust to 
the new climate reality, and manage their urban 
forests so they survive and thrive in new climate 
conditions.
