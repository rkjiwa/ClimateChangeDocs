A review of the chart above indicates that recurrent flooding, drought, and wildfires are the 
primary concerns at the 79 installations included in the analysis. 
 
Examples of Vulnerabilities to DoD Installations and Infrastructure 
 

The sections below provide examples of impacts to the selected military installations.  
Each section below includes a brief general description of the vulnerability factor and possible 
impacts to military installations or infrastructure followed by examples. 
 
Recurrent Flooding 
 

Vulnerabilities to installations include coastal and riverine flooding.  Coastal flooding 

may result from storm surge during severe weather events.  Over time, gradual sea level changes 
magnify the impacts of storm surge, and may eventually result in permanent inundation of 
property.  Increasing coverage of land from nuisance flooding during high tides, also called 
“sunny day” flooding, is already affecting many coastal communities. 
 

Joint Base Langley-Eustis (JBLE-Langley AFB), Virginia, has experienced 14 inches in 
sea level rise since 1930 due to localized land subsidence and sea level rise.  Flooding at JBLE-
Langley, with a mean sea level elevation of three feet, has become more frequent and severe. 
 

Navy Base Coronado experiences isolated and flash flooding during tropical storm 

events, particularly in El Niño years.  Upland Special Areas are subject to flash floods.  The main 
installation reports worsening sea level rise and storm surge impacts that include access 
limitations and other logistic related impairments. 
 
                                                 
3 This table was updated to assign NGIC to the Army, changing the total number of Army installations to 21 and 
removing the “NGA” category and correcting language in the report, as well as the Appendix.
