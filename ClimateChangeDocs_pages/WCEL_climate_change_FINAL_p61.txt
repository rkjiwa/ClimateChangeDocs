Financial planning needs to adequately and accurately address the maintenance, 
upgrade and replacement costs for infrastructure, which is part of asset management, 
discussed below. In many cases climate change will increase the rate of deterioration 
of existing infrastructure, and have an impact on infrastructure capacity, design and 
location for the future. There will also be instances where existing infrastructure will 
no longer be sufficient, whether adequately maintained or not, such as the case where 
changed sea level design guidelines apply. See www.env.gov.bc.ca/wsd/public_safety/

FINANCING  REsPONsEs  
TO CLIMATE CHANGE

When faced with the need to address a 
greatly increased urban/interface forest 
fire hazard due to mountain pine beetle 
damaged trees, the City of Prince George 
negotiated a Community Forest Agreement 
with a five-year replaceable license to 
manage Crown forest lands. While some 
of its “urban” logging was estimated to cost as much as six times as conventional logging, 
Prince George obtained funding from a variety of sources including, UBCM, NRCAN, the 
provincial government and others. www.env.gov.bc.ca/cas/adaptation/pdf/adamson.pdf

While there 
may be little 
funding available 
specifically for 
climate change 
adaptation 
measures, most 
communities receive 
investment from 
both government 
and private sources 
for development 
and redevelopment 
activities.
