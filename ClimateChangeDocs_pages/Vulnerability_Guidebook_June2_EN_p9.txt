FOREWORD

Canada has 397 million hectares of forests and other woodlands, representing 10% of 
the world’s forest cover. Our forests constitute a world-class natural treasure providing 
ecological, economic, social, and cultural benefits to all Canadians, regardless of whether 
they live in small northern communities or large urban centres. Canada is committed 
to sustainable forest management, which aims to maintain and enhance the long-term 
health of forested ecosystems while providing ecological, economic, cultural, and social 
opportunities for present and future generations.

One of several factors that pose both opportunities and challenges in terms of effectively 
and efficiently meeting our sustainable forest management goals is climate change and 
its inherent uncertainties. The Canadian Council of Forest Ministers (CCFM) identified 
climate change as one of two priority issues for Canada’s forest sector. In its A Vision for 
Canada’s Forests: 2008 and Beyond, the CCFM stated, “Consideration of climate change 
and future climatic variability is needed in all aspects of sustainable forest management.” 
In addition, to minimize the risks and maximize the benefits associated with a changing 
climate, Canada’s provincial and territorial premiers asked their Ministers responsible for 
forest management to collaborate with the federal government on adaptation in forestry 
through the CCFM’s Climate Change Task Force. Phase 1 of this work, completed in 2010, 
involved a comprehensive assessment of the vulnerability of various tree species and 
identified management options for adaptation. Phase 2 has gone beyond the level of 
trees to look at climate change adaptation within forest ecosystems and the broader forest 
sector. The goal of phase 2 was to equip members of the forest sector with a suite of tools 
and state-of-the-art information to enable them to make better decisions about the need 
for adaptation and the types of measures that may be most beneficial.

Over a period of 2 years, nearly 100 individuals from a wide range of organizations have 
contributed to achieving this goal. The fruits of their labour have been captured in the 
CCFM’s Climate Change Adaptation series, which comprises several technical reports and 
review papers. This current workbook draws upon information from all the previously 
published papers and reports in this series. It is a highly practical and user-oriented 
workbook that will enable forestry professionals to conduct evaluations of climate change 
vulnerability and potential adaptation options in a comprehensive and structured manner 
as a means of making informed investment and management decisions. 

It is our sincere hope that these documents, which will be used in conjunction with 
workshops, seminars, and presentations, will benefit Canadian forest practitioners 
from coast to coast to coast as they seek innovative ways to adapt sustainable forest 
management policies and practices for a changing climate.
