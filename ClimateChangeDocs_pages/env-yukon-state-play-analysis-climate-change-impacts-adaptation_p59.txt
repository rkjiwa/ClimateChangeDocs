Description 

Project identified priority areas of community concern 
related to climate change in 13 Yukon communities and 
increased awareness of important areas for future climate 
change programming.  

Identified priority climate change areas of concern and 
monitor the impacts of climate change (on water 
resources), adapt to changes, provide access to information 
(water data).

This project looks at case studies where actions to mitigate 
and adapt to climate change in the energy sector have 
merged to determine how such actions can be repeated 
elsewhere. The co-benefits of such an approach include a 
reduction in the overall cost of responding to climate 
change that ensures the energy sector is both climate-
friendly and climate-ready.  

This project will evaluate the impacts of climate change on 
how Yukon manages energy by evaluating future electrical 
demand and supply and subsequent implications for energy 
resource planning. This work will identify potential risks and 
opportunities for the Yukon energy sector and inform 
energy resource planning going forward.
