STORM SURGE refers to strong coastal waves pushed ashore by high winds during a storm. On the coast 

this represents the difference between the observed water level and the predicted astronomical tide. 

SUBSIDENCE refers to the sinking of the Earth’s surface in response to geologic or human-induced factors 

and may occur through gradual settlement or sudden collapse. 

VULNERABILITY refers to the degree to which a system is susceptible to, or unable to cope with the 

adverse effects of climate change, including variability and extremes. Climate change impacts include 
inland flooding or coastal hazards (e.g., coastal storms, coastal flooding, coastal erosion).

WEATHER is the state of the atmosphere (e.g., temperature, precipitation, wind) at a specific time and 

location.

WETLAND refers to a land area that is saturated with water, either permanently or seasonally. Wetland 

areas have characteristic aquatic plants adapted to their unique soil conditions and are considered 
a distinct ecosystem. Wetland water may be saltwater, freshwater or brackish. Wetland areas provide 
important environmental functions, principally water purification, flood control, and shoreline stability. 
Wetland areas are considered the most biological diverse of all ecosystems.
