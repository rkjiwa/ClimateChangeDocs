APPENDIX 2

If the impacts are water supply
shortages, temperature changes,
changes in the number of
growing days and in the
frequency of natural
disturbances; these will have
both positive and negative
implications for agriculture and
food security

If the impacts are a reduction 
in snowfall, this will pose
challenges for winter sport
industries, while beaches and
natural parks will be faced  
with both challenges and
opportunities in a changing
climate

The consequences could be issues such as:
(cid:129) Projected changes in the local climate are generally expected to have positive
impacts for agriculture in terms of the number of growing days, length of the
growing season and potential to grow higher-value crops. This will be
constrained, however, by soil suitability, moisture and erosion. Other threats
include more frequent and severe pest infestations as their range extends
northward, and the impacts of more frequent extreme weather events.

These consequences could lead to potential vulnerability at the local level as
follows:
(cid:129) Vulnerability of agriculture to climate change is complex: it is dependant upon

direct and indirect climate effects, economic factors and technological and
adaptation changes 

(cid:129) The increase in number of growing days, decrease in frost-frequency in spring
and fall, extension of the frost-free period and trend towards an earlier spring
could have a positive impact on the agricultural growing season in Canada.
Moderate climate change will likely increase yields of rain-fed agriculture in
North America by 5 to 20% over the first decades of the century (high
confidence). However, potentially positive impacts on agriculture are
dependent on appropriate soil types, soil moisture, water availability and
erosion. Potential for more spring flooding as well as summer drought
conditions (lower soil moisture and streamflow)

(cid:129) Changes in temperature can improve or impair production of different crops;

crops currently near thresholds will be negatively impacted (medium
confidence) 

(cid:129) Heavy rainfalls can impact agricultural crops 
(cid:129) Possible introduction of new agricultural pests and diseases

The consequences could be issues such as:
(cid:129) As winters become milder and less precipitation falls as snow, winter sport

industries, notably the ski industry, will be negatively impacted. As sea level
rises, more severe weather and storm surges become more frequent, beaches
and waterfront areas could erode or become submerged. Warmer weather
could attract more tourism for parks and beaches; however, ecosystem impacts
of climate change discussed above could threaten these areas.

These consequences could lead to potential vulnerability at the local level as
follows:
(cid:129) Winter recreation could be negatively impacted, but snowmaking could offset

some of the reduction to the ski season 

(cid:129) Recreational beaches would change and some could become submerged 
(cid:129) A longer warm weather tourist season could increase visits to Canada’s natural

parks, bringing economic benefits, but more pressure on ecological systems
