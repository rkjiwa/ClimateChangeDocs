APPENDIX 2

If the impacts are sea level rise,
changing ocean temperatures,
extreme weather events; these
will have impacts on intertidal
and marine ecosystems

The consequences could be issues such as:
(cid:129) When sea level rises at a moderate pace, intertidal ecosystems will naturally
migrate inland. In the local context, however, flood protection and coastal
development pose a barrier to this natural migratory process that will limit the
ability of these ecosystems to adapt to changing sea level. Expected increases in
extreme weather and storm surges will add to the stress on these ecosystems. 
Increased ocean temperatures can also have serious implications for local ocean
productivity, including phenomena such as red tides. Changes to ocean
productivity and ecosystem function will have cascade effects on dependent
species such as sea birds that depend on this food supply. Additionally, invasive
species may fundamentally change coastal ecosystems.

(cid:129)

These consequences could lead to potential vulnerability at the local level as
follows:
(cid:129) Rates of coastal wetland loss will increase due to sea level rise (high

confidence); salt marshes may mitigate this effect or they themselves may
decrease, depending on rate of sea level rise and storm impacts

(cid:129) Existing dykes may prevent the natural migration of intertidal ecosystems as

(cid:129) Dikes and other mitigation/adaptation measures could have negative effects on

(cid:129) Extreme weather will additionally stress ecological integrity in coastal areas
(cid:129) Warming is likely to extend and intensify summer thermal stratification,

contributing to oxygen depletion 

(cid:129) Estuarine communities and littoral biological productivity will change as sea

level rises 

(cid:129) Potentially negative impacts on ocean biodiversity and productivity, and

resulting impacts for sea birds due to a decrease in food supply 

(cid:129) Coastal habitats and dependent species will be increasingly threatened

If the impacts are changes to
water quantity, temperature and
salinity, this will stress fish,
fisheries and the food chain 

The consequences could be issues such as:
(cid:129) Climate change will contribute to profound changes in salmon health,

migration patterns and spawning success. 

(cid:129) Declines in salmon populations have cascading effects for terrestrial species and

ecosystems that depend fundamentally on the salmon as a food and nutrient
source. Changes in water temperatures and river flows will create opportunities
for exotic species to invade.

These consequences could lead to potential vulnerability at the local level as
follows:
(cid:129)
(cid:129) Fisheries will be negatively affected by salinity and temperature changes in

Salmon stocks in sharp decline throughout North America 

rivers

(cid:129) Profound changes to salmon health, migration and spawning success 
(cid:129) Observed warming of the rivers is likely to have negative effects on salmon and
cascade effects on predators, but positive effects on species tolerant of warmer
water
