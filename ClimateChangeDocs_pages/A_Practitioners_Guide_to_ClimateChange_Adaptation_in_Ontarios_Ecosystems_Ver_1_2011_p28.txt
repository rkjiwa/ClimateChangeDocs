ASSESS CURRENT VULNE RABILITY 

 
 
 
 
 
Step 2 involves building an understanding of the study area, including the current exposure and  sensitivity to climate, the adaptive 
capacity of the species or system, and other contextual information. With this information, a comparison to future vulnerabilities can 
be completed later in the process.  

Assessing Current Exposure, Sensitivity, and Adaptive Capacity 

To  assess  potential  future  vulnerabilities,  it  is  necessary  to  understand 
the current vulnerability  of the system. For example,  understanding fire 
patterns and related contributing factors such as high temperature days 
and/or periods without rainfall could help in exploring what might happen 
if future conditions are hotter and/or drier. Additionally, systems that are 
already  stressed  are  more  likely  to  experience  adverse  effects  from 
changing climatic conditions.  

Vulnerability  is determined by the degree of exposure, sensitivity, and 
adaptive capacity in a system.  

Exposure  is  defined  as  the  nature  and  degree  to  which  a  system  is 
exposed to significant climatic variations (IPCC, 2001).  

Sensitivity  is the degree to which a system will respond to a change in 
climatic  conditions.  In  many  cases,  sensitivity  and  exposure  can  be 
characterized jointly (Smit and Wandel, 2006).  

Adaptive  capacity  is  the  ability  or  potential  of  a  system  to  respond 
successfully  to  climate  variability  and  change  (IPCC,  2007c).  This 
concept  is  related  to  many  other  commonly  used  concepts  such  as 
coping ability, robustness, and resilience (Smit and Wandel, 2006).
