Do I need a backwater valve?

C
A mainline backwater valve is placed directly into the sewer lateral at
the foot of your basement wall. The device allows sewage to "ow in
only one direction â€“ out of your house. When sewage begins to move
toward your basement, the valve closes. Some municipalities offer
subsidies to offset the cost of installing a backwater valve. Make sure
you install the type of valve recommended by your municipality.
Installation of the backwater valve may reduce the cost of insurance 
or be required as a condition of insurability.
