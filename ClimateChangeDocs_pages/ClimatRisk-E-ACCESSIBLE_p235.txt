2.2 FUTURE CLIMATE PROJECTIONS

Projected changes in climate in Atlantic Canada for the 21st century include continued warming of 
air and water temperatures, as well as increased precipitation. Recent analysis as part of a global 
climate model comparison project5 suggest increases in mean annual temperature of 1°C in the 
near term (2016-2035) to about 3°C by the end of the century. The greatest warming is projected 
to occur in winter. Mean annual precipitation is projected to increase by about 3 percent in the 
near term and almost 10 percent by the end of the century throughout the region, with the greatest 
increases occurring in winter and spring. Snowfall is likely to comprise a reduced proportion of total 
precipitation; the seasonal duration of snow cover will likely decrease (Swansburg et al., 2004); and 
freezing rain events are likely to increase during winter (Cheng et al., 2011). Tables A1-A4 (located 
in the annex of this chapter) present provincially-specific temperature and precipitation projections 
for the Atlantic region to 2100 over three time horizons. Seasonal periods include winter (December-
February), spring (March-May), summer (June-August), and autumn (September-November). Data 
was derived from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) global climate model 
under an ensemble of RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 scenarios (Canadian Climate Data and Scenarios, 
2015). These data reflect uncertainty associated with these projections by presenting a range of 
values from the 25th-75th percentiles of CMIP5 outputs. The median value (50th percentile) appears in 
brackets following the range.
