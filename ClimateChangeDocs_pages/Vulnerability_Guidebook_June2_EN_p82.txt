Review the theory 
and practice sections 
associated with each 
worksheet, as presented 
in the preceding chapters. 
These sections explain in 
more detail the purpose of 
each worksheet and each 
section (e.g., table column) 
within a worksheet. Keep in 
mind that the worksheets 
and tables represent a 
suggested approach 
to recording data and 
discussions as you work 
through the vulnerability 
assessment process. 
Some adaptation of the 
worksheets is expected to 
ensure that the outcomes 
of the process fit the 
context of your assessment.

7.1  Worksheets for Chapter 1

The following three worksheets will get you started on assessing vulnerability and 
mainstreaming adaptation into SFM. The worksheets are designed to facilitate project 
initiation and to define the scope and scale of the vulnerability assessment. Each 
worksheet consists of multiple tables.

Worksheet 1.1  Define the problem or challenge
 

Table 1.1   Factors prompting a vulnerability assessment for the SFM 

 

 
 

Worksheet 1.2 

 

 

 
 
 

system of interest

Table 1.2   Anticipated benefits of conducting a vulnerability assessment 

and potential consequences of not doing so 

Table 1.3   Statement of purpose for the vulnerability assessment
Table 1.4   Statement of one or more outcomes for the vulnerability 

assessment

 Describe the SFM system and define the scope of the vulnerability 
assessment
Table 1.5   Description of the managed forest in the SFM system of 

interest

Table 1.6   Overview of organization or agency that is undertaking the 

vulnerability assessment

Table 1.7  Actors within the SFM system of interest
Table 1.8  Management objectives for the SFM system of interest
Table 1.9  Key nonclimatic factors currently affecting your SFM system

Worksheet 1.3  Confirm the scope of the assessment 
 
 

Table 1.10  Resources available to carry out the vulnerability assessment 
Table 1.11  Confirmation of the scope of the assessment

Worksheet 1.1.  Define the problem or challenge

The goal of the tables in this worksheet is to address the question, “Is there a significant 
concern about the effects of climate change on SFM in the region of interest, and if so, why?” 
This worksheet also prompts you to articulate the purpose and expected outcomes of an 
SFM vulnerability assessment should any significant concerns be raised and the need to 
adapt be identified.
