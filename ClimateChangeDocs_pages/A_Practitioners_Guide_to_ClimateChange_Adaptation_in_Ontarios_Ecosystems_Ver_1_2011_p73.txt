Menu Approach 

Climate change adaptation actions and strategies are widely discussed in academic literature, applied case studies, and an array of 
other  information  sources.  To  assist  in  identifying  adaptation  options  applicable  to  particular  impacts  or  a  particular  study  area, 
project  teams  can  develop  a  menu  of  possible  adaptation  options  from  the  literature  and/or  from  targeted  review  by  experts 
(Swanston and Janowiak, in review)..  

With this menu, teams can seek input from natural resource managers and stakeholders to determine whether the adaptation options 
list is complete and which actions may be most realistic and feasible for their needs.  

Wherever possible, efforts should be made to refine adaptation approaches by aligning actions with existing management planning 
and decision-making (e.g., forest management planning) and working with those responsible for implementing the plan to determine 
next steps (Swanston and Janowiak, in review). 

Such  an  approach  can  use  a  menu  approach  and  integrate  methods  such  as  online  survey  (e.g.,  Survey  Monkey)  and  ranking 
methods (e.g., Flash-Q), workshop facilitation, and a variety of other decision-making and input-seeking methods.
