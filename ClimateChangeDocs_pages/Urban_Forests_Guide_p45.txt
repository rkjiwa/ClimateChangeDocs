Increase the Biodiversity of Urban Forests 

•	 Plant a diversity of tree and shrub species. 
This avoids monocultures that make it easy 
for pests and disease to spread, and raises 
the odds that at least some of the tree 
species will thrive in future climates and 
be resistant to new pests and diseases. The 
Municipal Specialist Certification Guide 
recommends the “10/20/30 rule”: no more 
than 10% of one species or cultivar, 20% of 
one genus, or 30% of one family.66 

•	 Ensure that there is a healthy distribution 

of age classes and growth rates within your 
tree population. Many communities with 
street trees have even-aged trees that are 
reaching the end of their safe and useful life. 

•	 Protect critical habitat and ecosystem 

components, particularly around streams 
and wetlands. Ensure that riparian setbacks 
are adequate to ensure that large trees and 
their associated vegetation can be retained 
well into the future.

•	 Create greenspace connections between 

treed and other natural ecosystems. This will 
help to support local biodiversity. 

The City of Prince George has been 
experimenting with different species of trees 
in city parks, including cultivars, in case native 
trees do not survive changing climates. 
The District of Invermere is planting a diversity 
of deciduous and coniferous trees to create a 
“resistant urban forest”. 

The District of Sparwood has removed beetle-
killed trees to reduce fire risk in residential 
interface areas. The District is replacing is 
replanting with a diversity of species and age-
classes of trees, in order to reduce the risk of 
tree loss from pests and disease. 

The Mayne Island Conservancy is working on 
a restoration project for Henderson Park that 
will enhance the resiliency of the park’s forest 
ecosystem.
