Figure 20|  A. Maps of CMIP5 multi-model mean results for the scenarios RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 in 2081-2100 of annual 
mean surface temperature change. The number of CMIP5 models used to calculate multi-model mean is indicated in 
the upper right corner of each panel. Hatching indicates regions where the multi-model mean is small compared to 
natural variability (i.e. less than one standard deviation of natural internal variability in 20-year means) and the stippling 
indicate regions where the multi-model mean is large relative to the natural variability (greater than two standard 
deviations of the internal variability in 20-year means) and where at least 90% of models agree on the sign of change.

B. Map of projected changes in temperature (Â°C) between the reference period 1971-2000 and the 2080 horizon (2071-
2100). The values are calculated from an ensemble of 137 global climate simulations from the CMIP3 ensemble. The 
large panel on the left shows the median values from the ensemble, while the smaller panels on the right show the 10th 
and 90th percentile values at each grid cell from the ensemble.
