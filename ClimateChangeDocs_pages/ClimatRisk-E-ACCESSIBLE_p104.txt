6.1 HISTORICAL CLIMATE IMPACTS

6.0 AIR TRANSPORT

Climate affects air transportation systems in many ways, including: 1) accidents where weather 
conditions have contributed to the causes; 2) service interruptions that have been caused by 
weather; and, 3) impacts on physical infrastructure systems.

WEATHER-RELATED ACCIDENTS

The air industry has a long history of managing and coping with weather conditions and has 
established standard procedures for accessing weather forecast information and incorporating that 
information into flight planning (Klock and Mullock, 2001). Impacts of severe weather are normally 
managed through avoidance practices, resulting in flight delays and through advancements in 
technology that incorporate advanced aircraft instrumentation systems. The result is a very low 
frequency of weather-related accidents.

In British Columbia, only seven aircraft incidents with weather related contributing factors over the last 
thirteen years have been of sufficient magnitude to warrant TSB investigation (Table 10).

Poor visibility 

High-density altitude conditions and 
reduced visibility. 

The TSB reports demonstrate that, historically, weather is rarely the sole cause of aircraft incidents.  
Rather, it is weather conditions and pilot error combined which led to an incident.  Furthermore, 
the relative scarcity of weather-related aircraft incidents indicates that the air sector has effective, 
ongoing management strategies and technological development to accommodate severe weather 
conditions, and will not fly when conditions are unsafe.
