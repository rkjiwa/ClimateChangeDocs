INTRODUCTION 

TABLE 1.   SUMMARY OF OBSERVED AND PROJECTED CHANGES IN CLIMATE IN CANADA

Climate factors Observed Climate Trends since 1900

(unless otherwise indicated)

Climate Change Projections to
2100

TEMPERATURE

(cid:129) Annual average precipitation increased by 12%
for Canada since 1950; 25-45% in Nunavut; 5-
35% in Southern Canada.

(cid:129) Increase in number of small to moderate
precipitation events and more days with
precipitation

(cid:129) Increase in fraction of precipitation falling as
intense events increasing in Northern Canada
and decreasing in Southern Canada 

(cid:129) Decrease in number of days with snowfall and

increase in proportion of precipitation falling as
rain instead of snow in Southern Canada.

(cid:129) Increase in total snowfall and frequency of heavy

snowfall events in Northern Canada.

FROZEN
GROUND

(cid:129) Increase in permafrost temperatures up to 2°C
(cid:129) Decrease in permafrost extent by 7% , with
springtime decreases up to 15% (Northern
Hemisphere)

(cid:129) Decrease in permafrost depth by 1 to 4 cm per

year

(cid:129) Increased extent of thermokarst terrains
(cid:129) Increased permafrost active layer depth
(cid:129) Decreased extent of seasonally frozen ground by

up to 15% in spring

(cid:129) Delayed ground freezing dates by 5 days

(cid:129) 0-10% increase in precipitation in the
South and 40-50% increase in the high
Arctic

(cid:129) Summer precipitation increase in

Canada’s North and decrease in
Southwest and Great Lakes regions

(cid:129) Winter precipitation increases across
Canada with larger increases of up to
30% in North

(cid:129) Decline in snow depth across Canada

except for areas around the Arctic coast
(cid:129) Changes in extreme daily precipitation

rate greater than changes in mean
annual precipitation rate

(cid:129) Probability of extreme precipitation

events in 2000 increases by factor of 2
by 2100

(cid:129) 30 to 50% increase in the depth of the

active layer in Arctic permafrost regions,
with the greatest increases occurring in
the northernmost areas

(cid:129) Shifts in the zones of continuous,

discontinuous and sporadic permafrost

(cid:129) 20-30% reduction in NH permafrost

extent

(cid:129) Increased soil moisture early in the
century followed by decreased soil
moisture toward the end of the century
as the permafrost active layer increases

SEA/LAKE ICE

(cid:129) Late summer Arctic sea ice decreased in extent

(cid:129) 12 to 42% decrease in mean annual NH

by 8% since 1979

sea ice extent.

(cid:129) Continued decline in Arctic sea ice

extent with some areas seasonally ice free
by the end of the century.

(cid:129) Shorter ice season on Great Lakes
