1.9 DOWNSCALING TECHNIQUES
GCMs simulate the evolution of the climate system 
over the entire planet, with a horizontal resolution 
of around one hundred to three hundred kilometres 
(left panel on Figure 11), for periods that can reach 
thousands of years. The calculation time required 
to simulate the global climate of required length at 

a finer resolution of a few kilometres, or even finer, 
is generally not within the reach of even todayâ€™s 
fastest computers. However, there is an increasing 
demand by the user community to obtain climate 
projections at a finer scale (right panel on Figure 
11).

approximately 200 km and information that has been downscaled to a 45 km grid cell (right panel).
