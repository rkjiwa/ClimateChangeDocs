If you do have a foundation drain, it can become clogged with debris
or collapse in some sections. A plumber will need to decide if it can be
!xed or it needs to be replaced.
If a plumber does !x or replace
the weeping tile, ICLR
recommends including a clean-
out port with access from the
surface to allow easier
maintenance in the future.

What is my weeping tile

A
connected to?
A weeping tile that is directly connected to your home’s
sanitary sewer lateral increases the amount of water that
enters the municipal sewer system during a heavy rainfall.
Disconnecting your weeping tile from the sanitary or storm
sewer can help reduce the chances that you and your
neighbours will experience basement "ooding. It can also reduce the
risk of structural damage to your home.

Do I have a sump-pump?

B
When weeping tiles are disconnected from sewer laterals, a sump-pit
and sump-pump must be installed. The sump-pump is used to pump
water from the weeping tiles to the lot’s surface. In some unique cases,
municipalities may recommend a sump-pump to pump weeping tile
water to the storm sewer system.

Is my sump-pump working correctly?
Sump-pumps get blocked and can fail if they are not routinely
inspected and maintained. On-going maintenance helps to
ensure the sump-pump keeps working long term. You can
inspect the sump-pump by pouring water into the sump pit,
and seeing whether or not the pump starts automatically.

Sump-pumps need electricity. They stop working during a power
failure. You should use a back-up system to make sure the pump works
when you need it. Talk to your plumber or electrician about options.
