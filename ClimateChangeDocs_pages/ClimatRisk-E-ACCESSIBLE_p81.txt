1.2 ECONOMY 

In 2013, British Columbia had a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of $215 billion, which represents about 
13% of Canada’s GDP (Statistics Canada, 2011). Historically, British Columbia’s economic activity 
was based around natural resources including forestry, mining and fishing. While these sectors are still 
important, the service sector has grown in importance, now accounting for four out of five jobs. Key 
service sectors include: finance, insurance, real estate, transportation, retail and wholesale trade, 
tourism, education, and manufacturing.

British Columbia’s economy depends heavily on trade, including international and interprovincial imports 
and exports (Table 1). Trade within the Asian Pacific region has increased significantly since 2001. With the 
growth of China as a global manufacturing centre, demand for British Columbia’s natural resources has 
increased. In 2011 British Columbia exported more to the Pacific Rim than to the United States. 

Increased demand from China and India have challenged British Columbia’s transportation 
infrastructure to meet these emerging opportunities. This infrastructure has played a key role in 
international trade due to its strategic location. For example, Prince Rupert, Canada’s closest port to 
the Asia Pacific Rim, saves up to 68 hours of shipping time compared to locations to the south, such as 
Long Beach in Los Angeles (Port of Prince Rupert, 2014).
