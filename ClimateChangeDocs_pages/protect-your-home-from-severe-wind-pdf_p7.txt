inside the home. Most doors do not have bolts or pins strong enough
to withstand tornadoes and severe winds. Many houses are equipped
with double entry doors. These doors typically consist of an “active”
door (which is used when only one door is needed) and an “inactive”
door (which usually remains closed but can be opened when
necessary). While these doors are convenient because they span a
wider opening than a single door, they are usually not as strong as 
a single door and are therefore more susceptible to wind damage.
Double-entry doors can be reinforced by adding a heavy-duty dead
bolt, slide bolts at the top and bottom of the inactive door and longer
hinge attachment screws into the doors and frame. 

Windows and sliding glass doors
Although tornadoes and severe winds can exert tremendous pressure
against homes, a signi!cant portion of property damage is not from
the wind itself but from airborne materials. Items such as tree limbs
and branches, signs and sign
posts, roof tiles and shingles,
metal siding and other pieces
of buildings (including entire
roofs in major storms) can
easily penetrate unprotected
windows and sliding doors.
This wind-borne debris can
cause signi!cant damage to
interior walls and ceilings not
designed to withstand such
forces. As well, wind
penetration results in the
uncontrolled build-up of
internal air pressure which
can weaken the structure. 

Flying debris from severe winds can easily penetrate
unprotected windows. 

The easiest and most effective way to protect windows and glass doors
is to install storm shutters. Building supply stores sell many kinds of
storm shutters, but homeowners can also make their own shutters out
of plywood. Use 5/8” marine plywood, cut to !t and ready to install.
