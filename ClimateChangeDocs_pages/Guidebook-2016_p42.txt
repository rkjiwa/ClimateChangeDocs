1.10.1 DELTA/SCALING METHOD (ALSO CALLED THE PERTURBATION METHOD)
This method involves a perturbation of the observed 
of observations or by using the corresponding quantiles 
climate data based on the relative change between the 
of the distribution (e.g.42 for an example of quantile 
simulated reference and simulated future periods within 
mapping technique). The latter allows for a different 
correction factor to be applied to the distribution tails, 
a given simulation. The relative change between the 
reference and the future is first calculated (Figure 13a) 
so that it is possible to change the extremes of the 
and the change (or delta) is then applied to the observed 
distribution differently than the rest of the distribution. 
An important point here is that this technique is applied 
time-series (Figure 13b). 
to specific time horizons (such as 30-year periods), not 
to the entire time-series. 

This method can be done using two approaches, namely 
by calculating a mean change over the entire distribution
