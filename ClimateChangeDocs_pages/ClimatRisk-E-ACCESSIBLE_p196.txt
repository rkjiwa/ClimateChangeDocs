2.0 ORGANIZATION OF TRANSPORTATION IN QUEBEC

The transportation of goods and people in Quebec is multimodal and interconnected (CPCS, 2013). 
While trucking is the preferred mode for transporting goods; railways and waterways that connect the 
St. Lawrence to the Great Lakes, also play an important role. Air transport, meanwhile, carries a lesser 
volume of goods, but remains a strategic mode when delivery must be done quickly and the weight 
of the goods is not an issue (CPCS, 2013: 2-29).

In Canada, the St. Lawrence is a key continental gateway. This multimodal axis of transportation is 
strategic for the economy, demographics and geography of the country, making Quebec a hub 
for the transportation of goods to other provinces and to the United States. The Quebec-Windsor 
corridor concentrates approximately 80% of the activities of VIA Rail Canada (2014). The St. Lawrence 
drainage basin, which includes the Great Lakes, is the largest drainage system in the world, draining 
more than one quarter of the world’s fresh water reserves (Institut de la statistique du Québec, 2014). 

Other regions of Quebec are connected to the southern part of the province by strategic corridors 
that allow for the exploitation of resources, such as forests, hydroelectricity and minerals. These regions 
depend primarily on roads for the transportation of goods and people. There are also air connections 
for each of these regions. The size of the area and the dispersed population result in major challenges 
in planning and managing transportation networks (Ministère des Transports du Québec, 2013a).
