In Northern Ontario, snow as a proportion of winter precipitation is likely to decrease, and freezing 
rain events are expected to increase in frequency by 60-85 percent (Cheng et al., 2007). This creates 
the potential for road, rail, and runway disruptions and safety issues in Northern Ontario. Warming 
and thawing of permafrost will most affect the hydrology of peatlands and surface stability in areas 
where permafrost is currently present (Prowse et al, 2009). Areas along the coast of James Bay and 
Hudson Bay will experience earlier break-up and delayed freeze-up of sea ice, and will also continue 
to experience falling relative sea levels throughout this century and beyond, due to a phenomenon 
known as “isostatic rebound” in which land previously depressed by glaciers rises gradually (Atkinson 
et al., 2016).
