Yukon ‘State of Play’: Analysis of Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation
 
 
APPENDIX A 

Yukon’s Climate 

November 14, 2017 

Currently, projections about future change in Yukon’s climate are made by combining historical 
data for each indicator with different emissions scenarios developed by the Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). These scenarios suggest possible future conditions based on 
different “Representative Concentration Pathways” or predicted amount of GHGs in our 
atmosphere based on more successful or less successful “paths” to stabilize or reduce 
emissions.  

Figure 4 shows the relative change in average Yukon temperature from one year to the next 
from 1950 through 2016.
