Sea leVel riSe

Significant impacts

2.1. increased flooding and storm surge damage along the coast and fraser river as sea levels rise and storms are more frequent.

2.2. reduced gravity drainage of existing drainage system as sea levels rise, resulting in more frequent flooding of low areas near storm sewer outfalls. 

2.3. increase in shoreline erosion affecting natural environments and public amenities such as parks, trails and access to the water

2.1 increased flooding and storm surge damage along the coast and fraser river as sea level rises and storms are more frequent
aCtion
Undertake a detailed Flood risk Assessment to quantitatively analyze risk and 
evaluate risk mitigation options (Use up-coming BC primer and Costing study 
as inputs).
Use risk Assessment information to develop and implement a City-wide Sea 
Level response with decision points and actions detailed over a timeline. 
Acquire LidAr mapping to support Flood risk Assessment as well as the  
Urban Forest and integrated Stormwater Management plans. 
Amend flood-proofing policies

Coordinate with other municipalities through the Fraser Basin Council and  
with the province of BC to ensure a regional approach.
initiate Flood-proofing awareness campaign among builders/developers  
including information on storage of hazardous materials, mechanical  
equipment and resilient building measures.
Hold a competition to highlight adaptation options for sea level rise

Address the influence of tide and changes to groundwater on existing  
buildings. 
initiate a Sea Level rise Working group to recommend next steps for  
City-wide strategic approach to sea level rise. 
evaluate opportunities to increase road grades in risk areas when nearby  
development or during road replacement. 
Adjust park/beach plantings to ensure resilience to saltwater.
