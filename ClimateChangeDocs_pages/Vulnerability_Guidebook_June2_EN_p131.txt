Develop a list of potential adaptation options: All options can be considered at this 
stage, with prioritization and feasibility of implementation to be assessed later. You may 
first want to review the list of adaptation options in Appendix 5. These options, compiled 
from the literature, are suggested ways to adapt forest management policies and practices 
to achieve management objectives in a changing climate. In Table 5.2, list potential 
adaptation options for each SFM objective. You may also want to flag certain options as 
follows:
•   Classify options as strategic, operational, or adaptive capacity options (doing so now 

may help to define an implementation plan later on).

•   Indicate whether each adaptation option is useful for reducing a negative impact on the 

objective or increasing a potential opportunity to help achieve the objective.

Reviewing the knowledge gaps and uncertainties list you have created as you have 
worked through this guidebook may also be a good starting point for identifying options.
You may want to describe the adaptation options in more detail than the space in Table 
5.2 allows; if so, use additional pages.
