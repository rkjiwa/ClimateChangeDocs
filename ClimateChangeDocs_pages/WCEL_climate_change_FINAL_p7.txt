Wherever possible, this guide provides concrete examples, drawing on the growing experi-
ence of local governments in BC, and also some examples from outside the province. Many 
of the strategies that can help to address a changing climate are also good practices that 
will benefit communities regardless of the climate change impacts they face. These benefits 
may assist local governments in developing a “business case” for climate change adaptation 
action. For example, using green infrastructure solutions like topsoil requirements, rain gar-
dens, bioswales and other measures can provide greater resilience with respect to increased 
precipitation.  At  the  same  time,  in  some  instances  they  can  also  save  local  governments 
money as a result of the reduced life cycle costs associated with these measures compared to 
traditional pipe and drain infrastructure. 

There is no one way to prepare for climate change, however there are emerging practices 
that can be followed or modified to fit local circumstances. It is hoped that this guide will help 
local governments better understand the scope and nature of the challenge that a changing 
climate presents, and how they can use existing tools and resources to implement climate 
change adaptation strategies.
