environmental Health Services at the BC Centre for disease Control provided 
the list of potential impacts of local climate change on health shown in table 8.

table 8: Potential health impacts from anticipated local changes in climate

Direct impacts
Morbidity and mortality 
from heat related illness

injury from falling debris 
and damaged infrastructure 
during storms

occupational health im-
pacts for outdoor work-
ers due to increases in 
extreme weather

Climate mediated impacts
Health impacts from biotic 
changes including new plants 
and insects
increases in the occurrence of 
mould, especially in low quality 
housing as a result of increasing 
precipitation and flooding
exacerbated allergies and  
respiratory illness as air pollution 
worsens with increasing  
temperatures.

indirect impacts
refugees or climate 
related conflict

power reliability 
may be affected as 
well as use patterns

While changes to water quality are generally a concern in other jurisdictions, 
the new Seymour-Capilano filtration plan has the capacity to deal with  
increased source temperature and turbidity. 
it is well established that the urban poor are particularly vulnerable to cli-
mate change and natural hazards due to where they live within cities with 
respect to both location and quality of housing, and the lack of reliable basic 
services.20 Children, the elderly, and those with existing health conditions are 
also likely to be more vulnerable to health impacts. 
Although heat stress may appear less threatening in BC compared to the 
rest of the country, much of the BC population is less acclimatized to  
temperatures above 30 °C. non-respiratory emergency room visits in Van-
couver currently increase with high summer temperatures and are expected 
to rise further with an aging population. 
Airborne pollutants cause wheezing, asthma attacks and impaired lung 
function, and are associated with increased respiratory illness, stroke, and 
heart attack.21 the national roundtable on the environment and the econo-
my reported that poorer air quality resulting from higher temperatures will 
lead to more hospital visits and millions of dollars in costs to local health 
care systems for Canada’s four major cities – toronto, Montreal, Vancouver 
and Calgary.
