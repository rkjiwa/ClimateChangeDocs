Trends in mean annual precipitation for the Prairies are much weaker than trends in mean annual 
temperature. This reflects, in part, the large differences in yearly precipitation, with the driest regions 
experiencing the largest inter-annual variability of any records in Canada (Sauchyn, 2010). Again, 
spatial variability is important (Figure 5). The 60-year record (1950-2010) shows statistically-significantly 
changes at only a handful of sites on the Prairies, and these show both increasing and decreasing 
precipitation (Bush et al., 2014).
