From the assessment 
framework…
“Forest management is 
inherently a long-term 
undertaking, and assessing SFM 
vulnerability therefore requires 
estimation of the potential future 
positive and negative impacts 
of climate change on forests. 
However, the potential impacts 
of future climate change on 
forests are uncertain. The third 
component of the vulnerability 
assessment framework therefore 
involves the development of 
scenarios of future climate and 
forest conditions.”

—Williamson et al. (2012)

3.1  Overview 

This chapter provides guidance on developing and describing future climate and forest 
impact scenarios. It is structured around two worksheets that are designed to characterize 
a range of possible future climate scenarios and associated forest impact scenarios:

Worksheet 3.1.  Develop and describe future climate scenarios 

Worksheet 3.2.  Develop and describe forest impact scenarios

Purpose of “developing scenarios”

Outcomes

Develop and characterize scenarios that 
encompass the range of potential future 
climate and the related impacts on forest 
ecosystems

•   Selection and description of climate 

change scenarios

•   Creation of forest impact scenarios 

•   Updated list of uncertainties and 
knowledge gaps related to future 
climate change and forest impact 
scenarios

Scenarios for an Uncertain Future 
Many aspects of the SFM system are weather-sensitive, and therefore SFM vulnerability 
and adaptation assessment should be based on expectations about what the future 
effects of climate change may be on the natural biophysical and human elements of 
the SFM system (see definitions in section 1.3.1). Weather and climate conditions affect 
growing conditions and tree, stand, and landscape processes, as well as infrastructure 
stability (e.g., roads and bridges) and human activities. Climatic change will modify future 
weather conditions and therefore can be expected to modify forest structure, species 
distribution, productivity, and disturbance patterns. Climate change will also affect 
physical attributes of the landscape such as permafrost, soil stability, and water regimes. 
Such modifications have important implications for the ability to achieve SFM objectives 
in the long run and for decision making today.

The Need for Scenarios 
Future climate change and the effects that such change may have on forest ecosystems 
are highly uncertain, in part because of limited, though ever-growing, knowledge of 
climate systems and forest ecosystems, but also because of the impossibility of predicting 
future human behaviors and values. In this situation of uncertainty, one option is to 
create a single prediction or forecast for the future (e.g., “this is what will happen”), using 
information generated by models or based on scientific knowledge and inference, 
and then to use this prediction to make decisions. Exclusively relying on this option, 
however, has a number of limitations, including the fact that model results are subject to 
assumptions and inherent uncertainty, especially over the time scales relevant to forest 
management planning. In fact, it is not possible currently, and may never be possible, to 
create a single accurate prediction of climate and SFM impacts for decades into the future, 
especially at time scales relevant to operational decision making.
