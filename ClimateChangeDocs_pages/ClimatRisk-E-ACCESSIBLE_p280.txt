When assessing climate impacts on cities, density (of both population and infrastructure) is a 
complicating factor. Localized impacts, such as strong winds and heavy rainfall, disrupt a higher 
volume of traffic and economic activity, and affect more individuals and infrastructure components 
in urban centres than in less densely-populated areas (Revi et al., 2014; Solecki et al., 2011). 

The deteriorating condition of municipal infrastructure further complicates the ability of Canada’s 
highgrowth and increasingly dense cities to accommodate a growing population. The 2016 
Canadian Infrastructure Report Card (CIRC), which assessed the condition of Canada’s municipally-
owned infrastructure, graded 14 percent of sidewalks, roads, and bridges, as “poor” to “very poor”, 
with a total replacement value of $50.4 billion. The CIRC provided these same grades to 17 percent 
of public transit infrastructure (vehicles, mobile technology, security systems, signalization equipment, 
and terminal facilities), with a replacement value of $9 billion (Canadian Infrastructure Report Card, 
2016).  The report indicated that under current investment/maintenance conditions, most urban 
transportation infrastructure will require significant and increasing investment as it ages – even 
infrastructure presently in “fair” to “very good” condition (Canadian Infrastructure Report Card, 2016). 
The pressure placed on this infrastructure by climate change is likely to expedite the need to replace 
or upgrade older assets.
