4.2 

Scope of SLR Planning 
Scope of SLR Planning Area analysis, for both Year 2100 and Year 2200: 
  Calculate  local  anticipated  values  of  High  Tide  Level,  Total  Storm  Surge  and  Wave  Effects, 

and determine resulting FCL including Freeboard; 
Interpret approximate related location of the Estimated Future Natural Boundary; 

 
  Establish a Setback line, shown as the greater of 15m from Estimated Future Natural Boundary 
or the Contour of the Future FCL; with consideration of potential shoreline erosion or accretion 
given  the  shoreline  characteristics.  It  is  the  intent  that  all  new  buildings  are  provided  a  15m 
setback,  to  protect  from  wave  and  related  splash  impacts  on  buildings  which  may  be  an 
increased risk due to SLR; 

Scope of SLR Planning Area objectives, policies and guidelines,  
 

for the SLR Planning Area Yr 2100: 
o  Establish  requirements  for  new  buildings  to  meet  FCL  and  Setbacks  in  accordance  with 
Provincial Guidelines, or to meet flood protection requirements as established by Qualified 
Professionals.  Written  design  and  construction  standards  from  Qualified  Professionals 
should be required for any variance to setbacks at the sea or coastal bluffs; 
Identify adaptation measures for existing buildings, including approaches to minimize the 
impacts  of  flooding  from  the  sea  and  provisions  for  evacuation  during  extreme  storm 
events; 
In consideration of zoning or rezoning applications; encourage or permit land uses that are 
compatible with coastal flooding risks; 

o 

o 

o  Provide  guidelines  for  land  use  practices  that  minimize  the  impacts  of  flooding  on  high 

value economic and environmental assets.
