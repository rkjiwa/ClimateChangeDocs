Uplift and Subsidence Rates  

Introduction 
This Appendix provides a brief summary of the available information on subsidence and uplift 
rates along the British Columbia coast. 
The BC Sea Level Report (2008) – Chapter 3 - provides a description of crustal movements 
along the coast of British Columbia and a brief summary of rates for selected locations. More 
specific  site detail  is  provided  in  Table  1-1  based  on  an unpublished  addendum  to  the  BC 
Sea Level Report (2008) provided by BCMOE. 

Site Specific Data 
The data in Table 1-1 summarizes the rates of uplift (positive) or subsidence (negative) and 
the standard error based on relative sea-level rates corrected for eustatic sea level rise (tide 
gauge stations) or on absolute trends of vertical motion (GPS stations).
