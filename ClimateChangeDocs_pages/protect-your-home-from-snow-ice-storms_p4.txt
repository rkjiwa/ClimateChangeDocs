First steps

Understand your home’s vulnerabilities
Roof collapse, roof or ice dams, and frozen pipes are the major
threats to homeowners during periods of extreme winter weather. It is
important to be aware and educated about your home’s vulnerabilities
to these threats. 

Talk to your local government

1
Local governments often offer important advice for homeowners on
how to protect their home from winter weather. Municipal government
websites, public works, utilities and the building department are all
useful sources. Towns and cities located in “snow belt” regions, which
traditionally receive signi!cant amounts of snowfall, will be able offer 
a great deal of expertise on how to protect your home.

왘 What advice do they offer?
왘 How do you report damage from extreme winter weather?
왘 What does your local government suggest you do?
왘 Is there any disaster-relief assistance you can apply for?
왘 Do they recommend contractors with expertise in winter-weather

protection?

왘 What permits, if any, are required to strengthen your home’s defenses?

Talk to your insurance agent or broker

2
It is critical that homeowners talk to insurance agents and brokers 
to understand what types of damage is covered under their policy.
Sometimes speci!c types of damage can be excluded depending on
your policy or the municipality where you live. Insurers can also identify
common sources of damage in your subdivision that you should 
watch out for. 

Have a building inspector evaluate your home

3
Because each home is different, building inspectors can offer important
insights into your home’s capacity to withstand winter weather.
Inspectors can provide important information on the age of your home
(ie. the interior plumbing), and your roof’s capacity to handle heavy
snow loads. Contacting your municipality is one way to !nd a good
home inspector with knowledge on your area.
