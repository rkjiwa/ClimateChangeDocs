Protect yourself and others  
when cleaning mould 
• Wear a disposable particulate mask (for example, 3M 8210 

or equivalent N95 mask), unvented safety goggles and 
household rubber gloves. 

• Consider isolating the room to protect infants, pregnant 

women, the elderly or those with existing health problems 
such as respiratory disease or a weakened immune system. 
• Use an exhaust fan blowing to the outside to help prevent 

contamination of other areas of the house, as well as to 
provide ventilation. 

Cleaning mould from building materials, 
furnishings and other items
Washable surfaces, such as tile or glass 
• Wipe or scrub surfaces using a damp cloth and a solution  

of water and unscented detergent. Check the product label  
for instructions.

• Sponge with a clean damp cloth.
• Dry quickly and thoroughly.
• Once dry, vacuum the cleaned surfaces  

as well as surrounding surfaces with a HEPA  
(high-efficiency particulate air) vacuum cleaner.

Drywall 
• Wipe the surface of the wall using a damp cloth and a  
solution of water and unscented detergent. Check the  
product label for instructions.

• Dry quickly and vacuum with a HEPA vacuum cleaner. 
• If you are unable to wipe away the mould, it is best to  

replace the drywall. 

Carpets and upholstered furniture 
If these materials were affected by flood water and mould  
is visible, they will likely need to be professionally cleaned  
or discarded. 

Any mouldy material or item that cannot be effectively 
cleaned should be sealed in plastic and disposed of. 
 
Sponges used for cleaning mould should  
be discarded after use.
