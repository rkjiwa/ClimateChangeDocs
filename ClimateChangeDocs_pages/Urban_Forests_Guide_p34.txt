4 As well as adapting communities to climate change, it is also 

important to adapt urban forests so that they survive and thrive 
in changing climates. Urban forests are part of a community’s 
‘green’ infrastructure that can be purposefully designed and 
managed to provide a myriad benefits to community. However, 
these urban forests need maintenance and re-investment just 
as much as ‘grey’ infrastructure (roads, sidewalks and pipelines). 
In return, they provide a variety of economic and other benefits 
(see Planting our Future).

URBAN FOREST  
MANAGEMENT TO  
FUTURE CLIMATES

‘Climate-proofing’ urban forests helps communities to protect 
their green infrastructure, manage tree-related risks and reduce 
associated insurance costs. Failure to invest in re-structuring the 
urban forest to meet future climates could result in increased 
costs for clean-up after wind- or snow-storms, or unnecessary 
loss to wildfire or pests. Proactive management—an ounce of 
prevention—is almost certainly cheaper than an ounce of clean-
up after a disaster.

Urban forests in your community are already subject to variable 
weather conditions, including extreme events such as heat 
waves, dry spells, heavy precipitation, and strong winds. As the 
climate changes such events are likely to become more frequent
