Granville Island 
Granville Island is a popular and developed urban site located inside False Creek in Vancouver, 
BC, Figure 1-14.  At present, the area is not diked and flooding has not been experienced during 
storms on the existing grade slab, which has an elevation of approximately + 4 m CGD.  As sea 
level rises over the next century, the area will become exposed to an increasing risk of flooding and 
measures will need to be taken to adapt to the risk.  If protection of the existing land-use is adopted 
as the option, a sea dike will be required. 
For  the  purpose  of  this  example  the  west  end  of  Granville  Island,  which  is  partially  exposed  to 
English Bay, Figure 1-15 and Figure 1-16, is considered. 
Land elevations in the area are reported to be stable, neither rising nor subsiding. 
The net expected (including land subsidence) regional sea level rise by 2100 for this area is 1.0 m.
