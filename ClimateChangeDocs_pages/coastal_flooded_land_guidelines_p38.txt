Introduction 
The incorporation of Sea Level Rise considerations into an update of the existing documents 
for the BC Ministry of Environment is structured into three documents: 
Policy Discussion Paper 2010 
Sea Dike Guidelines 2010 
Guidelines for Management of Coastal Flood Hazard Land Use 2010 
To aid the reader in understanding the updates to the existing documents there is a need to 
understand fundamental concepts and definitions relating to BC Coastal Flood Hazards. This 
Appendix provides a summary of the fundamental concepts and definitions. 

Fundamental Concepts in BC Coastal Flood Hazard 
The  existing document: Flood Hazard Area Land Use Guidelines 2004 was  focussed  on 
river flood risks. The section on flooding by the sea (Section 3.5) did not fully anticipate sea 
level rise and assumed a static sea level. 
Sea Level Rise (SLR) is now understood to be a certainty in the future and very likely to result 
in  an  increase  of  1.0  m  by  2100.  However,  the  rate  and  height  of  SLR  has  considerable 
uncertainty.  The  Policy  Discussion  Paper  2010  summarizes  the  range  of  projections  for 
SLR that apply to BC. 
Figure  B1  illustrates  the  elements  relating  to  the  risks  from  the  sea  in  the  existing  Flood 
Hazard Area Land Use Guidelines 2004.
