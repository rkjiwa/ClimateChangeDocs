Food safety
The following foods should be considered unsafe  
and discarded:
• Food in boxes, bags, paper and plastic wrap 
• Food and drinks in bottles, plastic containers and jars, 

including home preserves (the area beneath the lid cannot  
be properly cleaned and disinfected)

• Fresh foods such as meats, fruits, vegetables, and eggs
Commercially canned food without dents, leaks and bulges  
are considered safe if properly cleaned and disinfected. 
Thoroughly clean and then disinfect dishes, eating and cooking 
utensils and food contact surfaces. Use a disinfectant that 
is non-toxic and safe for food contact surfaces. Follow the 
directions for use on the product label. 
Discard any eating utensils, cutting boards and other  
food contact surfaces that cannot be properly cleaned  
and disinfected. 

If you have been without power, food in your refrigerator and 
freezer may be at risk. Follow these tips to reduce the risk of 
food-borne illness:
• Avoid opening the refrigerator and freezer doors. If the door 
is kept closed, refrigerators will normally keep foods cool for 
four hours. A full freezer without power will normally keep 
food frozen for approximately two days, and a half-full freezer 
will normally keep food frozen for one day.

• Add bags of ice or ice packs to help keep the food cooler  

for a longer period of time.

• Consider using coolers or ice chests with a supply of ice  

for food storage.

• Throw out perishable foods such as meat, fish, poultry,  

eggs and leftovers that have been at temperatures above  
4°C (40°F) for more than two hours. 

• Throw out food items that have come into contact with  

raw meat juices.

water, sewage or

been contaminated  
by either.
