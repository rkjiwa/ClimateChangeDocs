Flooding is a common, naturally occurring event in B.C. Although it 
can happen at any time of year, the most severe floods typically occur 
in spring—known as freshet—or during fall and winter. This seasonal 
flooding is usually caused by heavy rain and snowmelt.

Homes may be at risk when flood water spreads to adjoining areas 
that are normally dry. Depending on the type and severity of flooding, 
it could take hours, weeks and potentially months for the water to 
recede and the clean-up to begin. The advice provided in this guide 
will help to make informed choices when purchasing a home or 
working to protect it.
