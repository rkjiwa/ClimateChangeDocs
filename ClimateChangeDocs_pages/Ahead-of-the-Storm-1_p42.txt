Company ProfileFullStack Modular LLC  63 Flushing Avenue-Unit # 63; Brooklyn, NY 11205CEO: Roger KrulakCategory: Full Volumetric Modular Design, Manufacture and ConstructWebsite: www.fullstackmodular.comLocation: U.S.FullStack Modular seeks to revolutionize the building process through manufacturing pre-fabricated components for high-rise multifamily, hospitality and student housing sectors. Their fully integrated modular solution for design, manufacturing and construction enables a higher level of control, predictability and scalability for development projects. How this technology prevents and mitigates flood and water damage riskFullStack’s fully integrated modular solution for design, manufacturing and construction offers an efficient, quality driven alternative to traditional construction. With complete weather protection, 80% of construction occurs off-site and at  ground level, resulting in fewer deliveries, safer working conditions and reduced weather impact.Product DescriptionAon Flood & Water Resilience Technology ProfileFireWaterSafetyThere is no welding or sweating of  pipes on site. All connections are  bolted, press fit or Victaulic connections  and the sprinkler standpipe can be extended within 1 hour in the stairwells which get stacked alongside the mods. The facades are installed in the factory and checked with aerospace accuracy to ensure perfect seal on site. Additionally, all mods are temporarily weather wrapped and receive a temporary EPDM roof to protect mod during transport and stacking.All the SMEP including connection pieces are shipped in the mods from the factory, no other deliveries are made to the site. Eliminates the need for scaffolding and our solution allows us to use the elevator shaft for people transport, eliminating the need for an exterior hoist.
