2.2 RAIL TRANSPORTATION

A number of operators provide rail services in Ontario. Canadian National (CN) and Canadian Pacific 
(CP) provide freight services within the province, while CN, CP, and CSX (a US company) operate 
internationally. The most significant commodities moved by rail in Ontario include fuel, metals, 
chemicals, and manufactured products (Statistics Canada, 2015b).

VIA Rail Canada provides passenger services along the Windsor-Quebec City corridor, from Toronto to 
Vancouver, and on the Lake Superior route (White River to Sudbury), while Amtrak crosses the border 
at Niagara Falls and provides service to Toronto. While VIA operates on a 12,500 km rail network, 98 
percent of this track is owned and operated by CN, CP, and other partners (VIA Rail, 2015). Ontario 
Northland also offers freight and passenger services from Cochrane (in the central sub-region) to 
Moosonee (in the North).

Ontario’s rail network also includes: 

•  10 local and regional freight operators; 

•  11 tourist railways; 

• 

• 

Three light-rail and metro (i.e. subway) systems (Toronto, Ottawa, and Kitchener-Waterloo by 
2017); and

The GO Transit system, providing regional passenger services in Southern Ontario (Railway 
Association of Canada, 2014). 

Metrolinx, a provincial agency responsible for regional transportation planning in the Greater Toronto 
and Hamilton Area (GTHA), has been upgrading rail throughout Southern Ontario in recent years 
(Transport Canada, 2014). Notable projects include the Union-Pearson Express, Eglinton Crosstown LRT, 
and the Regional Express Rail (RER) initiative, a 10-year plan to provide faster and more frequent GO 
Transit service and electrify core segments of the rail network.

Ontario’s rail sector is relatively stable, although operational track-kilometres are declining (Statistics 
Canada, 2015b). In total, Ontario operated 16 thousand km of track for both freight and passenger 
services in 2013 – a 15.5 percent decrease from 2009 (Statistics Canada, 2015b). Other recent trends 
in Ontario’s rail sector include:  

•  Cargo originating in Ontario and destined for other provinces and international markets declined 

20 percent from 2001 to 2013 (Statistics Canada, 2015c). 

•  Goods transported by rail into Ontario from other provinces and North American jurisdictions 

declined 18 percent from 2001 to 2013 (Statistics Canada, 2015c).  

•  Passenger movements along VIA’s Ontario corridors have declined significantly in recent years, 

contributing to changes in service patterns (Transport Canada, 2015). 

• 

In contrast, ridership on the GO Transit network increased approximately 28 percent from 2007 to 
2013, representing a growing segment of Ontario’s commuter market (Metrolinx, 2014). 

2.3 MARINE TRANSPORTATION

The Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Seaway (the Seaway) is the most important stretch of navigable 
water in Canada, encompassing four Great Lakes with Ontario shoreline and the St. Lawrence River. 
Hundreds of other lakes and rivers in Ontario, particularly in the northern and central sub-regions, also 
provide shipping, tourism, recreation, and subsistence benefits.
