As the impact of climate change further highlights weaknesses in many systems, a social 
determinants of health approach to considering the changing climate would add great value 
in national efforts toward reducing vulnerability and risk (e.g. addressing food security, 
availability of potable water, safe housing, working conditions, stable income, and sustainable 
development). This would support a more integrated or horizontal approach whereby 
adaptation frameworks are informed by different perspectives. Many authors argue that most 
mitigation and adaptation responses to climate change are “no-regret” options, which lead  
to direct reductions in the burden of ill-health, enhance community resilience, alleviate poverty, 
and address global inequity. It is important for all sectors to bring their unique positions and 
perspectives together to define future considerations in governance and actions towards 
successful adaptations for mitigating health impacts of climate change in Canada and globally.
