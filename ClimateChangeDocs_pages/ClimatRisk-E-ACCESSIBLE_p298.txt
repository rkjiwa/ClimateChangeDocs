Climate factor

Extreme heat

sidewalks and supporting 
infrastructure (stormwater 

management, signals, electricity)
•  Pavement and sidewalk 

operations and supporting 
infrastructure (stormwater 

management, signals, electricity)

•  Rail buckling (speed restrictions, 
spillage, derailment, scheduling 
delays, sensor malfunctioning)
Sensor malfunction on rail tracks 

• 

Frozen track switches 

• 
•  Rail cracking
•  Utility disruptions (e.g., power loss, 

broken water mains causing tunnel 
flooding) for electric locomotives, 
signalization equipment, and tunnels
•  Damage to underground transit lines 

and tunnels

•  Rail bed/embankment destabilization
• 

Slow orders, reduced train speed

roads and sidewalks
• 
Thermal expansion of bridges
•  Heat stress for labourers and 

active transportation users 
(impossible or unsafe daytime 
construction)
Traffic signal malfunctions

• 
•  Higher road/vehicle maintenance 

costs

•  Decreased active mode share; 

• 

modal shift to public transit/ 
automobile
Increased  electricity demand, 
leading to loss of power
Traffic signal malfunctions

• 
•  Decreased active mode share;
