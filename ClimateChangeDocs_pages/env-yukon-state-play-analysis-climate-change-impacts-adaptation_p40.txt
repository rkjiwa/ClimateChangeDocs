Extreme weather events and wildfire also have direct and indirect implications for human health 
and wellbeing. Flooding events affect the safety of individuals, the health of those whose 
drinking water quality is impacted or whose access to medical supplies or treatment is affected 
by flooding events, and the mental wellness of people whose property and living conditions are 
negatively impacted. Similarly, wildfires that lead to community evacuations or property 
damage can have significant impacts on the people in those areas. Furthermore, anticipated 
increases in wildfire activity presents the potential for increased respiratory health impacts 
related to wildfire smoke. In 2017, Yukon government’s Department of Health and Social 
Services initiated a project to improve monitoring of wildfire impacts on human health and 
improve emergency planning for extreme weather events and wildfires.
