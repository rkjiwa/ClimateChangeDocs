Worksheet 4.2.   Evaluate adaptive capacity of the SFM system

This worksheet provides a set of questions to guide the assessment of adaptive capacity 
as part of the broader vulnerability assessment approach described within this guidebook. 
The approach presented in this worksheet is relatively simple and direct. More intricate 
analysis of adaptive capacity can also be pursued but may require the participation of 
specialists. Williamson and Isaac (2013) provided a detailed overview of approaches for 
assessing adaptive capacity. 

The capacity to adapt is the ability of individuals, organizations, or management systems 
to adjust to change, to take actions to moderate potential damages, to take advantage 
of opportunities, or to cope with the consequences of change. The means to adapt are 
a function of the assets and resources that contribute to adaptability (e.g., knowledge 
capital, human capital, social capital) and the factors that affect the ability to effectively 
mobilize or utilize adaptive capacity resources (e.g., awareness and perceptions of 
risk). Investment in adaptive capacity and the process of mobilizing adaptive capacity 
resources are also influenced by institutions. Sometimes, existing institutions pose 
barriers to adaptation (thereby reducing adaptive capacity). Thus, the ability to adapt 
may also depend on the ability to adjust, modify, or transform institutions. The ease with 
which institutions can be modified or transformed is in turn affected by the system of 
governance. The following are some of the key factors that contribute to the adaptive 
capacity of SFM organizations or systems: awareness and risk perceptions, knowledge 
capital, human capital, social capital (partnerships and networks), institutions, and resource 
governance. Questions related to each of these categories are presented in the Tables  
4.2.1 â€“ 4.2.6.

It should be noted that the capacity to adapt to climate change is not the same as a 
general capacity to adapt, although these concepts are related. SFM organizations and 
systems with a certain general capacity to adapt may in fact have a lower capacity to 
adapt to climate change. For example, a particular SFM organization or system might have 
significant human capital but lower human capital relevant to climate change impacts 
and adaptation. For the purposes of this assessment, both general adaptive capacity and 
adaptive capacity specific to climate change are of interest.

What is being assessed? The first step in assessing adaptive capacity is to identify 
and describe the organization or system that is being assessed. The adaptive capacity 
assessment should align as closely as possible with the organization or system defined in 
section 7.1, above.
