1.6 CLIMATE PROJECTIONS
Climate projections are the portions of a simulation 
that represent the future (Figure 7). They therefore 
represent  the  plausible  evolution  of  different 
climate variables that describe the climate system 
over several decades to centuries under different 

emissions scenarios. The first year of this future 
period is the year that corresponds to the first year 
when emissions scenarios are used to run climate 
models  changes,  as  opposed  to  observed  GHG 
emissions. 

Ensemble members

It is possible to produce a large ensemble of simulations, or of plausible climate outcomes by running 
numerous models with different emissions scenarios. A model can also be run multiple times with the 
same RCP with slight perturbations in the initial conditions, for example by changing the start date of the 
simulation to obtain what are called ensemble members. Because of the chaotic nature of the climate 
system, these small changes will yield different responses (succession of meteorological events) and thus 
slightly different climate projection values.
