Worksheet 2.2: Describing Current Non-climatic Stresses 

If  possible,  consider  historical  growth  patterns  in  the  project  area,  economic  shifts,  and  historic  and  recent  land-use  changes. 
Information on existing stresses, as well as professional judgement and expert opinion, can help when considering many of the non-
climatic  factors  that  influence  the  current  status  of  a  system.  Depending  on  what  other  non-climatic  stresses  may  be  present,  a 
description  of  the  stresses  may  be  qualitative  or  quantitative.  Describe  whether  and  to  what  degree  the  non-climatic  stresses  are 
impacted by climate change.
