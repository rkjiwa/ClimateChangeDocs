Case Study - Kamloops 
Future Forest Strategy

The Kamloops Future Forest Strategy emphasized “management adaptive capacity” in a 
vulnerability assessment for a forest area of 2.7 million hectares in central British Columbia. 
Management adaptive capacity was defined as encompassing current legislation, policies, 
administrative structures, and other factors that shape the way forest management functions 
in the area, including its influence on the management actions that forest managers are willing 
and/or able to implement.  

Following the identification of possible management actions to reduce the sensitivity of 
ecosystems, adaptive capacity was considered by evaluating barriers to implementation. The 
following five broad themes or general barriers emerged: 

(1) lack of a comprehensive strategic planning process 

(2) more costly reforestation 

(3) more costly or break-even harvesting 

(4) need for ongoing stand management (e.g., beyond free growing) 

(5) requirement for government to take on increased management risk.

4.3.2     The Practice
Adaptive capacity assessments rely largely on interviews, discussions, and surveys 
during which individual practitioners and policy specialists share their views about their 
individual and collective adaptive capacity, based on a list of assets or determinants taken 
from the literature. Assessment of adaptive capacity is highly contextual and details of 
the assessment will vary depending on the focus of the assessment (see “Case study – 
Kamloops Future Forest Strategy”).

Worksheet 4.2 (Evaluate adaptive capacity of the SFM system) provides guidance 
on assessing adaptive capacity characteristics, based on the framework proposed by 
Williamson and Isaac (2013). The worksheet consists of a series of questions that users can 
ask themselves and their organizations to help understand their capacity to adapt both 
generally and specifically in relation to climate change.  

4.4  Assess Current and Future SFM Vulnerability

4.4.1     The Theory
According to the IPCC, vulnerability “is a function of the character, magnitude, and rate of 
climate change and variation to which a system is exposed, its sensitivity, and its adaptive 
capacity” (Parry et al. 2007). Systems that experience relatively low level of impacts, either 
because they are not exposed to significant climate changes or variability or because they 
are insensitive to these changes (or a combination of these factors) have low vulnerability. 
Where there is potential for large impacts on a system because of high exposure or high 
sensitivity (or both), high adaptive capacity can reduce the degree to which the system 
is vulnerable. However, in cases where an impact critically affects the ability to meet
