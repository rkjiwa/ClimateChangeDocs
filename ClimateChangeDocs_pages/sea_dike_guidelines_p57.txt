Joint Occurrence of Storm Surge and Tide 
An  important  element  in  the  design  of  a  sea  dike  is  establishing  the  appropriate  stage  of 
astronomical tide, for combination with a storm surge, to be used for setting the total water 
level, and associated wind and wave related effects, for the Designated Flood Level. 
This  topic  is  an  area  of  ongoing  research  and  development  and  warrants  additional 
investigations  of  its  own.    For  the  purpose  of  this  document,  which  maintains  the  existing 
guidance in the Dike Design and Construction Guide 2003, that combines the maximum 
high tide with the appropriate storm surge, the problem becomes one of assigning an AEP to 
the selection of the storm surge (and the Designated Storm) that is consistent with the total 
water level or Designated Flood Level. 
The problem can be addressed by considering storms and the associated effects, including 
storm surge, winds and waves, as processes that are totally independent of the astronomical 
tides.  The combined probability, or alternatively, the AEP of the combined effects, becomes 
simply the product of the probability of the storm and the probability of there being a high tide 
present on the coast at the same time. 
The  simultaneous  values  of  residual  water  levels  and  the  associated  astronomical  tides 
recorded at Tofino are shown in Figure 2-5.  This data, which covers approximately 66 winter 
storm periods during the total record shows that the combination of both a high tide (4.1 m) 
and a high storm surge (residual water level) is quite rare.

In simple terms, the probability of having a high tide during the winter storm season, which 
typically spans 3 to 4 months (mid-October to mid-January), is related to the number of days 
in this period when a high tide is expected – spring tides typically exist for approximately 3
