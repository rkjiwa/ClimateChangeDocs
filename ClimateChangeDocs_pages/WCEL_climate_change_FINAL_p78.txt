Local governments rely on insurance to help cover what may be infrequent or unforesee-
able losses. Natural hazards, like floods and fire, are often the immediate cause of these 
losses. These types of events can cause severe and widespread damage to local infra-
structure and property, particularly when infrastructure fails as a result, not to mention 
the public safety issues. An unusually violent and heavy rain storm in Toronto in August 
2005 was estimated to have cost $547 million.50 Fire services attended to more than 1,000 
calls, and rainfall in North york was measured at 103 mm in one hour, much greater than 
a one in one hundred year storm.51

Because local governments are responsible for local infrastructure, and it would be dif-
ficult or impossible to maintain sufficient financial reserves to account for their losses 
related to these types of catastrophic events, they have traditionally relied on insurance 
to at least partly recover costs.

The insurance industry has been speaking out with respect to the need to take action to 
address climate change. According to the Insurance Bureau of Canada, in recent years the 
frequency and severity of sewer backup damage and claims has risen sharply across the 
country. Water damage is now the leading cause of property damage in Canada, totalling 
around $1.7 billion/year.52

Faced with higher levels of risk, insurers have two options: restrict coverage, or increase 
premiums.  To  maintain  insurance  coverage  at  an  affordable  rate,  local  governments 
would be prudent to review their insured assets in light of climate change and determine
