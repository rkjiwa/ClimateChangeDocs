COLLABORATION AND ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT ARE APPROACHES THAT GOVERNMENTS 
AND INDUSTRY ARE INCREASINGLY PURSUING TO ADVANCE ADAPTATION (CHAPTER 9). 

Collaboration has emerged as an important mechanism for successful and efficient adaptation to climate change. Across 
sectors, there is a common challenge of needing to adapt to continuous cumulative changes with limited resources. By 
learning from the work of others (e.g. through assessments, communities of practice and workshops) and collaborating 
with organizations that share similar goals, efficiencies and synergies can be found.  Numerous examples of collaborations 
between different levels of government, as well as industry and non-governmental groups are discussed throughout this 
report (Box 2) and continued collaboration will be a key driver moving adaptation forward. While roles and mandates may 
differ between jurisdictions and organizations, the end goals of reducing vulnerability to climate change and enhancing 
resilience are shared.

Many sectors are starting to use adaptive management approaches (Figure 8) to deal with changes in climate and other 
stressors and related uncertainties (which will always be present in adaptation decision-making). Adaptive management 
involves ongoing monitoring, adjusting, experimenting and re-evaluating, and requires a flexible and responsive approach to 
adaptation. Examples of adaptive management approaches discussed in this report include operations related to hydroelectric 
generation (Ch. 3), water level management on the Great Lakes (Ch. 8, 9), and forest stand management (Ch. 3).
