1.3 GEOGRAPHY

British Columbia’s unique landscape strongly influences the province’s transportation systems  
(Figure 2). Ground transportation routes generally follow river routes and mountain passes, rather  
than the straight-line alignments typical of many other areas of Canada.   Thus, routes can be 
circuitous and often involve significant changes in elevation. 

British Columbia includes ten ecoprovinces, defined as part of a provincial ecoregion classification 
system (Figure 3). Ecoprovinces are areas with consistent climate processes, oceanography, relief 
and regional landforms. Each has a unique climate and they exhibit different sensitivities to projected 
climate changes.  The ecoprovinces generally align with the physiographic features of the province, 
as do the major transportation corridors.  With this understanding, it is possible to evaluate how 
climate change trends in British Columbia may affect transportation systems based on generalized 
climate change projections for relevant ecoprovinces within the province.
