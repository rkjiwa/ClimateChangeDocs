Adaptations for roads, bridges, 
and associated infrastructure 
(including signals, stormwater 

management)

• 

• 

Improving structural design 
of tall infrastructure for more 
turbulent wind conditions (i.e. 
bridges, traffic signals)
Installing back-up power sources 
for traffic, pedestrian, and 
cycling signals

• 

• 

Adaptations for urban rail 
infrastructure and operations

Improving structural design 
of tall infrastructure for more 
turbulent wind conditions (e.g., 
bridges, rail signals)
Installing backup power sources 
for rail signals

•  Updating emergency response/

•  No examples found in the 

contingency planning for 
evacuation

literature

• 

•  Developing a business continuity 
plan for extreme weather events 
so that critical services can be 
maintained
Incorporating climate change considerations into financial risk 
management practices, asset management, and service delivery
Issuing “green bonds” to raise capital for environmentally-sound 
infrastructure projects
Implementing local tax rebates/incentives for private landowners to 
improve stormwater management

• 

• 

—

•  Accessing intergovernmental grants targeted for resilient transportation 

• 

infrastructure
Improving redundancy within and between modes to enhance 
resiliency

•  Purchasing transit vehicles (buses and trains) better able to withstand 

• 

• 

adverse weather conditions
Increasing land-use mix to reduce the number and length of vehicle 
trips (reducing road wear and tear)
Establishing a schedule for assessing infrastructure usage/condition/
climate interactions  

•  Conducting emergency drills across municipal departments (ensure 

personnel and equipment are prepared)

•  Undertaking/updating floodplain mapping to identify vulnerable 

community infrastructure and assets

•  Amending/updating zoning by-laws and standards to account for sea 

level rise, require set-backs, etc.
