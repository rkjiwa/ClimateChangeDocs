Description 

Local and scientific methods were used to observe and 
evaluate climate change impacts in Old Crow, and a final 
report was produced to give recommendations for further 
action (i.e. the development of a risk management and 
adaptation plan). Information concerning the assessments 
and other aspects of the project was collected and 
disseminated via General Assemblies and gatherings and 
presentations were conducted on climate change impacts 
and programs and initiatives to various forums (local, 
regional and national meetings and workshops).
