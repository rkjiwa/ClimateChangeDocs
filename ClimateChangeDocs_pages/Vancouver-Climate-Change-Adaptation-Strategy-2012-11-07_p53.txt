return PerioDS

the return periods correspond to the maximum or minimum events so rare that they are expected to occur only once every 5, 10, or 25 years on average. 
these may also be interpreted as the events with a 20%, 10%, and 4% chance of occurring each year, respectively. the following changes show the projected 
change in return periods expressed as a ratio of frequency of occurrence in the past. For example, an average ratio of 2 for a 25 year return period would 
mean that we expect an event that only occurred once every 25 years in the past is expected to occur twice as frequently by 2050.

events, expressed as a ratio of frequency of occurrence in past for metro Vancouver.
