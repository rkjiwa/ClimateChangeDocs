Worksheet 3.2.   Develop and describe forest impact scenarios

The term “impact” refers to the effects of climate change on natural and human systems. 
The effect may be direct (e.g., a change in tree growth in response to a change in the 
mean, range, or variability of temperature) or indirect (e.g., some influence on the 
frequency and severity of wildfires).

Forest impacts are based both on climate exposure, as described in Worksheet 3.1 
(Develop and describe future climate scenarios), and forest ecosystem sensitivity, 
the degree to which a system will respond to changes in climatic conditions and climate 
variability (e.g., extent of change in ecosystem composition, structure, and function). 

In this worksheet, you can describe the range of impacts that the climate change 
scenarios developed in the Worksheet 3.1 may have on various aspects of the forest 
ecosystems within the SFM system of interest. The intent is to help you understand how 
these potential impacts may affect your ability to achieve SFM objectives (see section 7.4). 
Use the same list of forest conditions and processes that you developed in Worksheet 
2.2 (Describe the relationships among climate, forest conditions, and forest 
management practices) as a starting point.

You may also want to assess an overall forest impact ranking for each scenario, using the 
following ranking system (see last row of Table 3.2).
