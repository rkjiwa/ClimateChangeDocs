Worksheet 2.1 (Describe climatic conditions and trends) provides a format for 
recording climate trends, climate normals, and sources of information about climate 
variability.

A basic approach

A comprehensive 
approach

Operational 
considerations  

At the Government of Canada climate website (http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_
normals/index_e.html), find climate data for at least one location that is near your SFM 
system of interest. Interpolated climate data for any geographic location in Canada can 
also be downloaded from the Canadian Forest Service’s regional, national, and international 
climate modeling website (http://cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/projects/3/6) (see Information resources 
box below).

Include on the team a climate scientist who can analyze historical climate data and prepare 
future projections. Analysis of data from local climate stations can provide information about 
change and variability for a number of relevant climate measures. 

Examples of climate measures that are important for day-to-day operations include changes 
in the number of frost-free days, the number of high and extreme fire hazard days, and the 
winter access season.

Information resources

National 
   • 

 The Government of Canada’s Climate website provides historical hourly, daily, and 
monthly weather data as well as 30-year climate normals for many weather stations 
across Canada (http://www.climate.weather.gc.ca).

   • 

 Natural Resources Canada, Canadian Forest Service: regional, national, and international 
climate modeling (http://cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/projects/3/6), specifically the web application 
for obtaining climate estimates for your location  
(http://gmaps.nrcan.gc.ca/cl_p/climatepoints.php).

Western Canada
   • 

 ClimateWNA (Western North America) is a program to generate high resolution climate 
data for western North America. See  
http://cfcg.forestry.ubc.ca/projects/climate-data/climatebcwna/#ClimateWNA for 
details.

Eastern Canada
   • 

 Ouranos is a consortium that brings together 400 scientists and professionals from 
different disciplines. Based in Quebec, Ouranos focuses on two main themes: “climate 
sciences and vulnerabilities” and “impacts and adaptation” (http://www.ouranos.ca).
