It  is  common  practice  in  offshore  and  coastal  engineering  codes  and  standards  of  practice  to 
include  provision  for  uncertainties  by  specifying  a  minimum  freeboard  or  similar  allowance.   
Generally the freeboard accounts for the known uncertainties in technical elements of the design 
methodology,  i.e.,  the  appropriate  wave  theory  for  the  depth  of  water  or  variations  in  seabed 
conditions along the shoreline, among others.  
In the specific case of the sea level rise to be considered for design, the problem is compounded 
by  uncertainties  surrounding  the  present  estimates  of  the  future  extent  of  climate  change,  the 
resulting sea level rise, the time frame over which a particular decision is being made and in some 
cases for the actions or consequences of other stakeholders or property owners that may directly 
affect a particular shoreline area. 
A  more  detailed  review  of  issues  related  to  appropriate  freeboard  allowances  is  provided  in  the 
companion policy document: Policy Discussion Paper 20103. 
As  a  minimum,  it  is  recommended  that  the  present  freeboard  allowance  of  0.6  m  should  be 
included in sea dike design, above and beyond any specific allowances adopted to deal with the 
known uncertainties for the area in question.  These known uncertainties should be explicitly stated 
during design.
