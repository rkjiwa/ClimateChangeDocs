Climatic Change

increase in sea level

Decrease in freshwater levels

increased frequency  
and severity of extreme  

weather events

impact Statement
increased flooding along the Coast and Fraser river as sea level rises and the storm surge 
and waves breach height of land
increased damage to structures (seawalls) and shoreline resulting in greater discontinuity  
of use
reduced gravity drainage of the existing drainage system, resulting in more frequent  
flooding of the False Creek low areas and Southlands 
Saltwater intrusion in built up areas affecting the longevity of underground infrastructure
Saltwater intrusion may foul fresh water wells or lead to water quality issues
Vpd facilities may not support emergency operations (low lying areas and lack of  
emergency power)
Liability issues in flood risk areas without restrictive covenants
increase in environmental refugees from surrounding areas increasing population stress  
on resources and development
increase in shoreline erosion affecting natural environment and public amenities such  
as parks, trails and access to the water
Saltwater intrusion at sanitary sewer pump stations will increase risk of corrosion and  
decrease in design life.
gradual inundation of low lying areas of land along the Coast or Fraser river
increased cost and difficulty acquiring insurance for private and public property owners  
in high risk areas
rising groundwater levels in coastal regions resulting in ponding and drainage problems
decrease in reservoir levels in the summer due to smaller winter snowpack and reliance  
on rainwater only
deleterious effects on species in area streams
increased public safety risk from the effects of more intense storms on infrastructure,  
especially streets.
decrease in durability of water distribution system and declining water quality due to  
increased turbidity due to landslides, etc. at source
increase in duration and occurrence of power outages causing secondary impacts to all  
service areas where back-up power has not been installed
Construction practices may be maladapted to changing climate with resulting risks to public 
safety and loss of assets
increased safety and health risks for vulnerable populations including water ingress, mould 
and loss of housing for those in low quality housing and health risks for the homeless
increase in temporary shelter turnaways as extreme weather events increase
