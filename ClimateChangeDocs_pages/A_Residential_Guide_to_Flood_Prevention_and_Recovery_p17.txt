Insurance considerations
Water-related damage from a flood can be extensive and the 
subsequent repairs could be very expensive. Water risks can 
come from both inside and outside your home. According to 
the Insurance Bureau of Canada (IBC), increasingly severe 
weather means that basement flooding and water damage are 
becoming more common. IBC offers the following tips when 
considering your coverage.
• Sudden and accidental bursting of plumbing pipes and 
appliances is covered by all residential policies. However, 
damage may not be covered when freezing causes the  
escape of water. 

• In general, water entering a home from overland flooding is 
not covered. Overland flooding usually occurs when bodies of 
water, such as creeks, dams and other watercourses, overflow 
onto dry land and cause damage. Overland flooding and 
seepage can’t be covered by home insurance because it is 
only a risk for the small percentage of the population who live 
in a flood plain. Since the purpose of insurance is to spread 
risk among many policyholders, flood insurance for those at 
risk would be unaffordable. 

• Water damage in a basement due to a sewer backup  
is only covered if specific sewer backup coverage has  
been purchased. 

• In certain circumstances, homeowners who are unable 
to return home due to insurable damage are entitled to 
additional living expenses (this coverage is generally not 
available if an evacuation becomes necessary as a result  
of overland flooding).

• If you do experience flood damage, you will need to provide  

a list of lost or damaged items as part of your insurance claim. 
Review your insurance policy so you understand what items 
to list. If you had a household inventory or video before the 
disaster, retrieve it for the insurance adjuster.

Take a household  
inventory or video so  
you can use it as part  
of your insurance 
claim if you ever  
experience flood  
or other damage  
in your home. 

Talk to your insurance  
representative to 
make sure you have 
appropriate coverage, 
because basement 
flooding and water 
damage are becoming 
more common.
