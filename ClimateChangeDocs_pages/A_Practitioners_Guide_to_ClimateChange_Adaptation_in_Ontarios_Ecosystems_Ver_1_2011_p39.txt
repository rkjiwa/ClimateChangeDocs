Assessing  the  vulnerability  of  species  and  ecosystems  to  climate  change  can  involve  a  range  of  methodologies,  from  qualitative 
assessments  based  on  expert  knowledge,  to  highly  detailed  quantitative  analyses  using  ecological  models  that  integrate  climate 
models.  The  choice  of  approach  may  depend  on  many  issues,  including  the  availability  and  quality  of  information,  the  level  of 
expertise, time and budget constraints, and other factors.  

While  a  growing  number  of  models  are  available  for  Ontario  and  other  jurisdictions  to  project  the  impacts  of  climate  change  on 
ecosystems,  the  ability  to  conduct  more  detailed  analyses  such  as  modelling  the  dynamic  ecological  responses  among  diverse 
species  within  and  among  ecosystems  is  still  relatively  limited  (see,  for  example,  Glick  et  al.,  2011).  If  possible,  integrating  local 
knowledge  and  science-based  methods  is  recommended  to  provide  a  more  comprehensive  and  effective  basis  for  analysis 
(Williamson et al., 2007).
