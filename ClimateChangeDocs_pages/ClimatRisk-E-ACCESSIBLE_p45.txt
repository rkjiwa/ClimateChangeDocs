As discussed, winter roads constitute an important component of northern Canada’s surface 
transportation network. Goods transported include bulk fuel, dry goods, building material and other 
items with a maximum truck load capacity of 64,000 kg (Federal, Provincial, and Territorial Sub-
Working Group on Northern Transportation, 2015). In the Yukon, winter roads facilitate community 
transportation (Deton’Cho-Stantec, 2013). There is no winter road system in Nunavut; however, the 
Government of Nunavut is assessing the feasibility of developing a seasonal network connecting 
the Kivalliq region with northern Manitoba (Brownie, 2013). Winter roads are much less costly than 
all-weather roads, and have a much smaller environmental footprint (Transportation Association of 
Canada, 2010). While a 9m-wide all-weather road in the Northwest Territories can range from CAD$1.2 
million to CAD$1.5 million per km (with maintenance costs up to CAD$15,000/km/year), winter roads 
range in cost from CAD$10,000 to CAD$20,000/km/season to open and operate (Transportation 
Association of Canada, 2010).

2.3 AVIATION

For communities not connected by all-weather or winter roads, air transportation is vital. This is 
especially true in Nunavut and the Northwest Territories, where aviation ensures community resupply 
and transportation year-round. To illustrate its predominance, consider that more than 110,000 people 
departed from and disembarked at the Iqaluit airport in 2006, despite a population of approximately 
6,000 at the time (Dunlavy et al., 2009). While Yukon communities are not as heavily dependent 
on air travel due to the territory’s extensive road network, aviation remains important for isolated 
communities like Old Crow.
