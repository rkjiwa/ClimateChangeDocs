Some municipalities have backwater valve rules. In most cases they
require the normally open (or open-port) mainline backwater valve.
This valve is installed directly into the sanitary sewer lateral, and serves
to protect all home plumbing !xtures from sewer backup.

When installing backwater valves: 
The valve should be installed based on the manufacturerâ€™s installation
instructions, which have speci!cations for placement and grading.
