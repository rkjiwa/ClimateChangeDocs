It can also be helpful to 
collect climate measures 
for recent extreme weather 
events (e.g., heavy rain or 
snow, drought, windstorm). 
Recent global analyses by 
Field et al. (2012) provide 
accepted methodologies 
for describing the 
frequency and severity  
of these events.

Climate Terms

Weather – The day-to-day and hour-to-hour atmospheric conditions at a given 
location.

Extreme weather event – An event that is rare within the weather conditions at 
a particular place. 

Climate – The “average weather” described in terms of the mean and variability 
of features such as temperature, precipitation, and wind over a period ranging 
from months to thousands or millions of years. The usual period for describing 
climate in Canada is 30 years. 

Climate variability – The highs and lows of climate conditions over a long 
period.

Climate change – A statistically significant change in either the average (mean) 
state of the climate or in its variability, measured over an extended period, 
usually at least 30 years. 

Climate trends – Data providing a picture of how much change has occurred 
in the past, for example, over a period of 50 to 100 years. Climate trends are 
derived from statistical analysis of historical climate data.

2.2.2     The Practice
In most places in Canada, the climate has changed during recent decades. A national 
assessment of climate change impacts reported by Lemmen et al. (2008) provided 
national- and regional-scale information about historical climate changes, known as 
“trends” (see section for national information in Information Resources box, below). More 
detailed regional or local information may be available for specific areas from national 
or regional climate information centers (see sections for western and eastern Canada in 
Information Resources box, below).

The climate information that has been collected by the Meteorological Service of Canada 
at weather stations across the country has been analyzed to generate “climate normals” for 
these station locations. Climate normals describe the average conditions over a 30-year 
period. Normals are available for three overlapping 30-year periods from 1961–1990 up 
to the most recent period of 1981–2010 (1961–1990, 1971–2000, 1981–2010). Comparing 
selected climate variables for the three climate normal periods may help to illustrate 
changes in climate.
