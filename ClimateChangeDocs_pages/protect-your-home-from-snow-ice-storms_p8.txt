and potentially leak into walls, ceilings or your attic. This water may
cause rot in the roof that leads to collapse. In addition, the “dam” 
also limits snow from falling off your roof, which can add to existing
snowloads and put pressure on the structure of your home. 

Prevention remains the most effective strategy for stopping ice dams.
Homeowners can take several steps to prevent heat from escaping
your attic or the interior of your house. 

왘 Look for any attic penetrations such

as attic doors, plumbing stacks,
electrical service penetrations, or
chimneys that allow heat to escape
from inside your house into the attic.
왘 Identify and remove any heat source

in your attic that will heat areas on
your roof. 

Incandescent light !xtures in the ceiling below
the attic can often generate enough heat to
melt snow on a roof. 

왘 Incandescent light !xtures in the
ceiling below the attic can often
generate enough heat to melt
snow on a roof. These !xtures
should be insulated to prevent any heat loss. Homeowners can
check for proper insulation by looking for any light from the !xture 
in the attic.

왘 Look for any form of penetration between your attic and roof, such

as a vent. If you can see sunlight from the outside, the vent will
need to be sealed or insulated.

Re-roo!ng also offers another
opportunity to prevent ice dams.
During installation homeowners can
install a secondary moisture or snow
and ice barrier to prevent heat loss. 
To make sure the barrier is effective
homeowners should consider using
two layers of underlayment that are
cemented together.  

Snow and ice shield.
