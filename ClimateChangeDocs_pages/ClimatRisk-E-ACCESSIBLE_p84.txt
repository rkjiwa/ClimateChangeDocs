2.1 OBSERVED TRENDS 

The Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium has done extensive work characterizing the current climate, 
identifying trends, and projecting future climate conditions for many regions in British Columbia.  These 
reports provide an analysis of trends across the province for the period 1901 through 2009 (Table 2). 
Over this period, British Columbia has experienced shifts in both temperature and precipitation.  These 
trends have accelerated since the 1950s. Overall, temperature across the province has increased 
by 0.18 °C per decade since 1951, an overall increase of 1°C. At the same time, the province has 
experienced generally wetter spring, summer, and autumn periods and significantly drier winters.

Relative sea level (relative to land height), has also been changing in British Columbia, with significant 
variability across coastal areas.  For example, during the past 50 years, sea level rose by 3.1 cm 
at Victoria and 2.0 cm at Vancouver, but decreased by 8.4 cm at Tofino (Vadeboncoeur, 2016). A 
number of factors contribute to changes in ocean levels, including atmospheric and oceanographic 
effects, such as storm surges and climate-variability cycles (e.g., Pacific decadal oscillation) 
(Vadeboncoeur, 2016). One of the dominant factors affecting relative sea-level change in British 
Columbia is vertical land motion, which can be attributed to a combination of tectonic activity 
(interactions of the Juan de Fuca and Pacific oceanic plates with the North American plate), glacial 
isostatic adjustment (the ongoing movement of land that was once covered by glaciers from the 
last ice age), and changes in ice-mass in the Coast Mountains and Gulf of Alaska (Vadeboncoeur, 
2016). Other factors that contribute to regional variability in sea levels include the influence of melting 
glaciers on nearby ocean waters and ocean surface topography alterations due to changes to 
ocean currents (Vadeboncoeur, 2016).

In addition to posing a long-term threat of coastal flooding, sea-level rise increases the risk of storm-
surge flooding.  Deeper water increases the height and energy of waves.  Extreme high water levels, 
which typically occur as storm surges are superimposed on high tides, can be particularly destructive 
to coastal infrastructure.
