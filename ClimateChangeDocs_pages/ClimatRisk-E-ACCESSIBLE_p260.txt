Six adaptation options were assessed (see Table 3). These options mainly focus on changes that could be 
made to the management of agricultural dykes in the Isthmus, which currently protect farmland against 
tidal flooding, and provide secondary protection for roads, rail, and infrastructure. However, the dykes 
are not designed to withstand severe storm events. Summaries of adaptation options are presented 
below. A key assumption in the study was that no option could result in increased risks or damages to the 
communities and municipal infrastructure of Sackville and Amherst.
