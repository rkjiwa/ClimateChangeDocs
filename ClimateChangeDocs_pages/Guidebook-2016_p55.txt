The goal of this section is to present how climate information can be tailored to the audience. In other words, 
the same climate information (e.g. past trends or projected future changes) can be presented using different 
formats. For example, projected changes in temperatures can be presented using a synthesis table (e.g. p.43), 
a map (e.g. p.48), or using a graph that plots the evolution of the change over time (e.g. p.59). 
The objective of this chapter is to present as many of the most commonly used formats as possible (Table 5). 
However, new formats are continually being developed by climate service providers and particular formats 
can always be created to meet the preferences of decision-makers or the particularities of a project.
In order to increase the capacity of decision-makers to critically evaluate the information that is provided to 
them, all figures, graphs and maps presented in this section are accompanied by explanations that describe: 
1) what climate information is presented and how should it be interpreted, 2) how the figure is constructed 
and 3) what are the limitations/caveats/possible ways to misinterpret the information.  In addition, the use 
of coloured font will remind the reader that additional information on key climate science concepts can be 
found in Chapter 1.
