Figure 1: Climate adaptation and urban forests

 
“Urban forests” are the total collection of 
trees and their growing environments found 
within our communities and their surrounding 
areas, from villages to city centres. They include 
the treed environments on both public and 
privately owned lands—in parks and backyards, 
along paths and boulevards, and other ‘green’ 
areas. They include cultivated landscapes, 
natural areas and, in some communities, local 
‘working’ or managed forests. Although they are 
referred to as ‘urban’ forests, this term applies 
equally to small and rural communities. 

“Urban forestry” is the deliberate management 
of these treed environments to provide a wide 
array of economic, environmental and social 
services to communities. Urban forests can 
be a key asset in supporting more liveable, 
healthy, sustainable and economically vibrant 
communities.
