First steps
1. Talk to your local government.
The !rst step is to visit your municipal government’s website or contact
the public works, utilities or building department to !nd out about
their programs on reducing basement "ooding. 

왘 What advice do they offer?
왘 Are there engineering studies on your subdivision?
왘 How do you report basement !ooding to them?
왘 What does your local government suggest you do?
왘 Do they offer any "nancial assistance programs

for plumbing installations?

왘 Do they recommend contractors or plumbers?
왘 What permits do you need in order to begin?

2. Talk to your insurance agent or broker.
Talk to your insurance agent or broker to !nd out about what types
of water damages are covered under your policy. Trying to make a claim
after you have suffered water damage is not a good way to !nd out
that you don’t have the proper coverage, or that overland "ooding 
is uninsurable.

3. Get a plumber to conduct a plumbing

investigation of your home

Each home is unique. A plumber or contractor who
is fully versed in home and municipal drainage systems can
best help you protect your home. Understanding the risks of
basement "ooding and the nature of your plumbing and
sewer connections will help to ensure that the best course of
action is taken to reduce future water damage in your
home. Your municipality may help you !nd a plumber.
