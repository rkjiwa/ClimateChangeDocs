8.0 PROVINCIAL CLIMATE ADAPTATION PRACTICES

The Government of British Columbia has been working to better prepare the province to adapt 
to a changing climate. This includes a province-wide plan Preparing for Climate Change: British 
Columbia’s Adaptation Strategy, which aims to build a foundation of knowledge and tools, make 
adaptation a part of the Government’s decision-making, and assess risks and implement priority 
adaptation actions in key climate sensitive sectors (British Columbia Ministry of Environment, 2010). 

Of specific relevance to transportation, British Columbia Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure 
has developed a set of notional best practices based on the outcomes from their climate 
change vulnerability assessments of British Columbia highway systems (British Columbia Ministry of 
Transportation and Infrastructure, 2014e). These notional best practices are generally applicable to all 
transportation infrastructure systems, and are grouped into three primary categories: data, personnel; 
and, process (see Box).

Adaptation_Best%20Practices.pdf 

Data

•  Keep weather and climate data up to date
•  Establish monitoring programs
•  Always consider the impact of extreme precipitation events
•  Consider combinations and sequences of events
• 
•  Ensure that projections are based on ensembles of climate model outputs

Identify sources for robust climate change information

Personnel

Identify, monitor and manage climate change issues

•  Strive for balance between computational methods and professional judgement
• 
•  Establish multidisciplinary climate change review teams
•  Work with qualified climate and meteorological professionals 

Process

•  Provide vulnerability assessment tools and appropriate training
•  Use risk management to address uncertainties
• 
•  Mandate consideration of climate change in ongoing activities

Incorporate climate change adaptation measures into planning cycles
