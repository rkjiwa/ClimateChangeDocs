Politique gouvernementale en 
matière de protection des rives, du 
littoral et des plaines inondables 
(Governmental policy for the 
protection of riverbanks, shorelines, 
coastlines and floodplains) 
Adopted in 1987, last updated

Originally intended to be 
legislation, this policy outlines 
coastal protection measures that 
were encouraged to be included 
in regional master plans (schemas 
d’amènagement)

Section 2.2 of the policy outlines a uniform 
setback of 10 m if the land grade is less than 
30 degrees from the shore and 15 metres if 
the land grade is greater than 30 degrees from 
the shore. Section 3.1 of the policy mandates 
a special permit for new construction on all 
shorelines, to ensure compliance with the 
measures outlined in the policy. Permits 
are issued by the relevant authority, which 
depending on the location will vary from 
the municipality, the region or the Province. 
Section 3.3 of the policy bans all construction 
directly on the coastline, with some exceptions 
such as piers, small bridges, water intakes, etc.

Change Action Plan, 2006-2012)

Stratégie gouvernmentale 
d’adaptation aux changements 
climatiques, 2013-2020 
(Government strategy for adapting 
to climate change, 2013-2020)

The QC government released 
its first Climate Change Action 
Plan in 2008. In addition to 
mitigation objectives (the goal 
is to reduce total GHG emissions 
by 20% below 1990 levels), 
objectives related to sea level rise 
adaptation are also included. 

The provincial government 
released its strategy for its 
second climate change action 
plan in February 2012, for public 
consultation. Once feedback on 
the proposed strategy has been 
integrated, the Climate Change 
Action Plan 2013-2020 will be 
published.

Section 2.3 entitled “Les actions visant 
l’adaptation du Québec aux changements 
climatiques” (Actions related to Quebec’s 
adaptation to climate change), sub point 2.3.2, 
measure 23 of the plan includes conducting 
more detailed research into the impact of 
climate change on coastal zones in order to 
develop plans for better protecting sensitive 
ecological zones as well as infrastructure.

Section 3 deals specifically with adaptation 
tools and outlines the need for: solid research 
in order to prioritise issues; increasing 
awareness on these issues; analysing the 
vulnerability of communities and ecosystems; 
communicating the data to the impacted 
communities; developing and implementing 
appropriate technologies; and adapting 
legal instruments and governance structures 
according to adaptation needs. Objectives are 
elaborated for achieving these needs.
