Elkford’s Official Community Plan9,10
The District of Elkford is a small community (population 2500) in the Rocky Mountains of southeastern British 
Columbia. Historically, Elkford has dealt with several climate-related hazards, including flooding, drought and 
wildfires. A changing climate magnifies all these risks. In 2008, Elkford, with support of the Columbia Basin Trust, 
a provincial crown corporation, developed a local adaptation strategy to assess the risks posed by climate change 
and identify corresponding adaptation actions. The Adaptation Strategy was developed concurrently with a revision 
to Elkford’s Official Community Plan (OCP), allowing the two to be fully integrated. Consideration of climate 
change in all decision making is one of the OCP’s 11 guiding principles. Adaptation actions in the OCP include 
a wildfire protection zone in which any development application must be accompanied by a fire hazard and risk 
assessment conducted by certified professionals before a permit is issued. The OCP also calls for the development 
of a community evacuation plan in the event of an extreme wildfire or flooding.
