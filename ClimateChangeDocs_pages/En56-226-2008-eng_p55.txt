TABLE 5.   EXAMPLES OF ADAPTATION ACTIONS THAT IF DESIGNED CAREFULLY COULD BE TURNED INTO SAM

ACTIONS AND EXAMPLES OF MALADAPTATIONS 

INFRA-
STRUCTURE

WATER
SECTOR

(cid:129) Manage land stability issues such as subsidence, heave, erosion and landslip, through such

(cid:129) Constructing strong foundations that extend below zones affected by seasonal variations in

practices 

moisture content
Infilling foundations

(cid:129)
(cid:129) Adopting flexible timber-framed construction techniques that divide larger structures into smaller

units with expansion and compression joints between them 

(cid:129) Components can be efficiently assembled, allow flexibility of design, and facilitate changes

Implementing managed realignment and avoidance of development in areas at high risk

through the lifetimes of infrastructures thereby facilitating application of the “diversified lifetime”
approach
Introducing gaps or joints into foundations, structures or services to compensate for strains 

(cid:129)
(cid:129) Carefully consider size, species, and placement of vegetation
(cid:129)
(cid:129) Reinforcing and re-grading slopes to prevent/minimize erosion and landslips
(cid:129) Developing surface erosion control structures (e.g. retaining walls and fences)
(cid:129) Creating stronger, deeper, better drained retaining structures
(cid:129) Maintaining drainage systems (e.g. channel management)
(cid:129)
(cid:129) Removing shotcrete (shotcrete provides the illusion of stability rather than support as it covers but

Implementing cross-shore structures (e.g. groynes) and toe protection structures

does not bond to slopes) 
Introducing moisture control systems/soil rehydration

(cid:129)

Encourage practices that reduce potential impacts to infrastructures from flooding events, such as: 

(cid:129) Raising floor levels, electrical fittings and equipment 
(cid:129)

Installing rainproofing and overhangs to prevent infiltration of heavy rain around doors and
windows

(cid:129) Constructing buildings from flood resilient materials that can withstand direct contact with

floodwaters without sustaining significant damages (e.g. concrete, vinyl and ceramic tiles,
pressure-treated timber, glass block, metal)

(cid:129) Purchasing removable household products like flood boards, air brick covers and flood skirts that

temporarily protect properties during flooding events

(cid:129) Using expandable/inflatable bungs to temporarily block pipes, drains and toilets to prevent backflow
(cid:129) Replacing impermeable wall finishes with limewash to encourage drying after inundation 
(cid:129) Converting suspended floors to solid, flood resistant floors 
(cid:129)

Sealing gaps around pipes and cables and joints between walls and frames of doors and low level
windows 
Installing pump and sump systems below ground floor
Introducing floating homes

(cid:129)
(cid:129)
(cid:129) Note: several adaptation measures listed above with regards to land stability are also relevant to

flooding

(cid:129) Demand and Supply Strategies: Building new water treatment plants and increasing retention

tanks
Installing desalination plants

(cid:129)
(cid:129) Reduce flooding events and minimize flooding impacts: Introducing silt detention structures,
gully plugs, and gabions to stabilize gullies, preventing settlement build-up downstream, slowing
movement of water, and increasing infiltration 

(cid:129) Diverting flood flows away from vulnerable areas
(cid:129) Building hard, permanent flood defences and barriers and constructing pumping systems to

reduce vulnerability to storm surges and anticipated sea-level rise
