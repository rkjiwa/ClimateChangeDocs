Think about how to address in-stream applications and identify any big projects that may 
be at very preliminary stages. Consider prioritizing a review of climate change adaptation 
considerations for these projects.

Community engagement is very important. Some climate adaptation strategies will require 
significant investment of tax dollars and local government resources. Citizens and elected 
officials will need to have a basic understanding of the climate change impacts in their 
communities so that they can make informed decisions. In areas subject to increased risks 
with respect to natural hazards as a result of climate change, for example, a community 
might need to weigh the costs and benefits of protection versus relocation. See Land use 
scenarios #1 and #3 in Appendix B for further ideas about community engagement.

In communities where funds are not available for adaptation planning, review the checklist 
in Appendix C in light of risks and vulnerabilities that have been identified.

16  Note that time is also an important variable to be considered — when will consequences be felt, and how long 

does it take to address them or put in place measures to anticipate them?
