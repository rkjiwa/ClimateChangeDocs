From the assessment 
framework…
“A description of the context is 
needed for three reasons. First, it 
ensures that the goals and design 
of the assessment are consistent 
with the management system 
and the management context 
for which it will be used. Second, 
it ensures a clear and direct link 
between the vulnerability and 
adaptation segments of the 
assessment. Third, it confirms 
that the organization has the 
necessary capacity to complete 
the assessment.” 

—Williamson et al. (2012)

1.1  Overview

This chapter provides guidance on how to begin assessing vulnerability to climate change 
and mainstreaming adaptation into SFM. The focus is to develop an understanding of the 
need to address climate change and thus undertake an SFM vulnerability assessment, and 
to clearly define the goals of the assessment.

This chapter also helps users of the guidebook to define the SFM system of interest by 
describing the spatial extent and scope of the assessment, identifying the actors and 
decision makers, understanding both the decision-making context (e.g., governance) and 
the policy context, and determining if the required resources are available to conduct the 
assessment as defined. Taking appropriate time at the beginning of the assessment to 
clearly define the system of interest is important to success. 

This chapter is structured around three worksheets that are designed to facilitate an SFM 
vulnerability assessment:

Worksheet 1.1.  Define the problem or challenge

Worksheet 1.2.   Describe the SFM system and define the scope of the vulnerability 

assessment

Worksheet 1.3.  Confirm the scope of the assessment 

Purpose of “providing the context”

Outcomes

To initiate your SFM vulnerability 
assessment by defining both the SFM 
system of interest and the scope of the 
assessment

•   An understanding of the reasons for 

undertaking an assessment

•   A description of the SFM system that will 

be assessed

•   A list of potential partners and interested 

groups/individuals

•   Confirmation of the scope of the 

assessment

1.2  Define the Problem or Challenge

1.2.1     The Theory
Ohlson et al. (2005) stated that “clearly formulating and specifying the management 
problem is perhaps the most important and least appreciated step in the development 
and evaluation of adaptation strategies.” They advocated for a direct statement of the 
problem and the decision context for solving the problem before an assessment is 
undertaken. Although the impacts of climate change are usually negative and can be best
