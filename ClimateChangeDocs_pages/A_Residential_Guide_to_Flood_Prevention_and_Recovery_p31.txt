Coping after a crisis
You may experience strong feelings of stress immediately or 
weeks after a flood or significant weather-related event. Stress 
can change how you feel and act. Acknowledging how you 
feel can help you manage stress. It is normal to have feelings of 
anxiety, grief, sadness, helplessness and anger after a significant 
event. Everyone has different methods of coping, and it will take 
time before you start to feel better. 

Stress
Stress is a normal response to good and bad life events but can 
become a problem when it affects how you cope or manage in 
daily life.
Some tips to help cope:
• Talk about your feelings with family, friends,  

neighbours and co-workers.

• Set a schedule and follow a normal routine as much as 

possible. It will take time before your life returns to normal.

• Eat healthy meals.
• Try to get regular sleep.
• Exercise and stay active.
• Accept help from your community.
• Offer to help in your community.
• Establish a family emergency plan in case of future events.
• Be compassionate with yourself and others.

Talking to children
It is important to be aware of your children’s reactions in the 
aftermath of a significant event. Changes in their behaviour  
may indicate they are under significant stress. For example, 
young children might start thumb-sucking or bed-wetting, 
develop aches and pain, become clingy or fearful. Children 
might withdraw and try to be brave, when they really need  
your reassurance. 

Signs that stress  
may be becoming  
an issue:

• Strained relationships  
with family and friends

• Changes in appetite  

and sleep patterns

• Inability to concentrate  

on work or school

• Replaying the event in  

your mind

• Avoiding places that  

remind you of the event

• Increased alcohol or drug 

use—i.e. turning to unhelpful 
coping strategies

• Feelings of sadness lasting 

more than two weeks

• Excessive guilt
• Isolating yourself
• Thoughts of harming others 
or yourself including suicide
