Snow can collect behind roof obstructions, such as the ones pictured above. 
These include vents, chimneys or gables

In the aftermath of signi!cant snow or ice event, there are several
important indicators a homeowner can use to determine if a sloped
roof is under structural stress from snow or ice. The Canadian
Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) recommends that
homeowners check for1:
왘 New water leaks inside the house originating from the roof 

or attic area.

왘 New internal door jams. If doors become dif!cult to open, it could

be a result of additional snow or ice loads on the roof.

왘 New cracks in the drywall or plaster could also result from additional

snow load or ice weight in the centre of the house.

왘 On sloped roofs, sagging on the ridge-line (where the two sides of
the roof meet) could be an indication of a potential roof collapse.

If you see any of these above indicators it is important that you
immediately take action to reduce the snow or ice load from the roof.
There are several actions a homeowner can take. For snow, the safest
approach is to contact a snow removal contractor. But a long snow-
rake with an extendable arm can also be purchased if you can access
areas of the roof with signi!cant snow accumulation from the ground.

Removing ice build-up represents a more signi!cant challenge for
homeowners. Homeowners can choose to drain, or physically remove
ice that has formed on the roof. For a sloped roof, drainage can
signi!cantly reduce the impact of potential ice damage.
