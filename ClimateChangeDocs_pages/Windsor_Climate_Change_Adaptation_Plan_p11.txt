Climate Change Adaptation Plan  2012 

 
Figure 7 highlights the association between all 
non-traumatic daily deaths that occurred from 
June 1 to August 31 from 1986 to 2005 and the 
historical maximum daily temperatures in 
Windsor. There is a strong association between 
temperature and excess mortality in the City of 
Windsor. As the figure shows, at approximately 
29°C/84°F excess mortality begins to increase as 
ambient temperatures increase.ix

Using the information obtained from the Windsor Airport station, an increasing trend in annual 
precipitation has been documented.
