BC has no formal requirements or stipulations 
for undertaking watershed planning processes 
beyond the provisions under the Water Act 
to develop a WMP, with approval from the 
provincial government. There is no standard 
template to follow. Nonetheless, many 
communities across the province have 
taken the initiative to complete watershed 
management plans by developing their own 
approach to address key concerns in their 
respective watersheds.

Characteristics, Benefits and Applications
Every watershed is unique in terms of its 
features, and every watershed planning 
process is unique in terms of the issues being 
addressed and the people involved. Across 
the province, watershed management plans 
take different names and different forms, 
including watershed strategies, watershed 
blueprints, watershed recovery plans and 
water use management plans. Despite these 
differences, several traits are shared by most 
watershed planning processes. Typically, 
watershed planning is:

 ▪ An iterative and adaptive process;
 ▪ A holistic process;
 ▪ Geographically defined;
 ▪ Integrated with other planning processes; and
 ▪ A collaborative and participatory process. 4
Conversations with local governments and BC 
communities suggest that many critical factors 
work together to enable a watershed-based 
approach to planning. These include:

 ▪  A burning issue within the watershed that 
demands attention (e.G., Water health issue, 
community conflict);
 ▪  An awareness and recognition of the  
importance of watersheds
 ▪  An understanding of a variety of planning issues;
 ▪  A political will that aligns with staff capacity  
and commitment;
 ▪  A willingness to work with neighbouring 
municipalities in shared watersheds 
(where appropriate);
 ▪  A designated body to coordinate the  
effort (e.G., Regional district, okanagan  
basin water board), with funding from 
participating municipalities;
 ▪  A strong stewardship ethic within the 
community; and
 ▪  A watershed that is at a scale that is  
practical and reasonable to work with.

Key Elements and Steps
There is no absolute template to follow for 
watershed planning. Every planning process 
and every plan is different. However, many 
elements are critical to the success of 
watershed plans. Recommended guidelines 
for watershed planning processes include  
the following:  

 ▪  Develop a clear vision, goals, objectives  
and action items;
 ▪  Seek political endorsement. The relevant 
decision makers must be willing to consider 
implementing the plan;
 ▪  Ensure full representation of all affected 
parties, while keeping the size of the  
process workable;
 ▪  Ensure that the planning process is 
understood, used and broadly supported;
 ▪  Provide access to appropriate technical and 
analytical skills and information resources;
 ▪ Obtain sustainable funding;
 ▪  Ensure planning is done before further 
development activities (e.g. urban 
development) will undermine the 
effectiveness of the plan;
 ▪  Factor in the impacts on future water inflows 
and recharge of climate change and activities 
and physical works that intercept water (e.g., 
farm dams and forestry);
 ▪  Include inputs from socio-economic analyses 
and incorporate consultation to improve the 
quality of decisions and build community 
confidence in the fairness of outcomes;
 ▪ Ensure that the values and interests of 
indigenous peoples are considered;

 ▪  Evelop capacity for learning and improving plans 
over time and the ability to evaluate the process;
 ▪  Provide adequate resources to develop and 
implement water plans and evaluate their 
outcomes; and,
 ▪  Improve monitoring and compliance  
of water use. 

Ideally, watershed plans and the organizations 
involved in implementing the plans should 
emerge from the planning process with:

 ▪  improved understanding of the watershed 
and how it functions;
 ▪  clear objectives of how to manage  
the watershed sustainably and in an 
integrated manner;
 ▪  clearly specified community and 
environmental outcomes;
 ▪  decisions that are based on the best 
available information;
 ▪  adequately resourced management and 
implementation; and
 ▪  good integration with other regional and 
resource-based plans.5

It should be acknowledged that many of these 
elements, steps and outcomes could also 
support or strengthen any and all of the other 
planning processes profiled within this guide.

Because of the complexity of watersheds, 
including the diversity of interconnections 
and dynamic change over time, an iterative 
process is recommended for watershed 
management planning. The following figure 
from the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency illustrates this (Figure 3).
