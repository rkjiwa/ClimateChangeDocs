The severity of consequences of climate change impacts and the likelihood that impacts will occur. 

Sensitivity  

The degree to which a system is affected when exposed to a stress. 

Social-ecological 
systems 

Vulnerability  

Complex, integrated systems in which humans are part of nature (Berkes and Folke, 1998)  

The degree to which a system is susceptible to, and unable to cope with, adverse effects of climate 
change, including climate variability and extremes. Vulnerability is a function of the character, magnitude, 
and rate of climate change and variation to which a system is exposed, the sensitivity and adaptive 
capacity of that system (IPCC, 2007c).
