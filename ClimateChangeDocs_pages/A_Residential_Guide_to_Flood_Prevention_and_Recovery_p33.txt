Repairing your 
home

Tips and considerations when you are  
repairing your home
• Do not attempt to reconnect the electricity, natural gas, 

telephone or TV cable yourself. Contact your service 
provider to reconnect it for you.

• A qualified service technician should verify the safety of  
any electrical system or appliance that has been affected  
by flood water before it is used. 

• Contact your local heating repair company to inspect your 

furnace and chimney.

• Professional companies can help you with cleaning and 

repairing your home. If you are making an insurance claim, 
your insurance adjuster may help you find a contractor. 

• Arrange for any necessary inspections and building permits. 

Your contractor may take care of these for you. If not,  
contact your Local Municipality to find out what steps  
you need to take.

• Consider installing basement flooding prevention devices  

such as a backwater valve or sump pump.
