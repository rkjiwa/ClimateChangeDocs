Finding Flood Information in New Brunswick 
 
Flood Hazard Maps and Flood Level Predictions 
 
In New Brunswick, flood hazard maps have been prepared for a number of areas that are known to be at 
risk of flooding. The maps describe the extent and anticipated frequency of flooding, and can be used to 
obtain flood depths at specific locations. New Brunswick’s flood hazard maps can be viewed and 
downloaded at:

In  addition,  predicted  sea  levels  have  been  calculated  for  all  of  coastal  New  Brunswick,  taking  into 
account the effects of high tides, storm surges and future sea level rise. This information is available in 
Updated Sea-Level Rise and Flooding Estimates for New Brunswick Coastal Sections (2014).

Some coastal communities have prepared coastal flood hazard maps. Check with your local planning 
authority.  
 
Other Sources of Information 
 
Not  all  of  New  Brunswick’s  flood-prone  locations  have  been  identified  on  flood  hazard  maps  and 
properties throughout the province may occasionally be impacted by localized flooding due to high water 
levels in rivers, streams and ditches, high groundwater levels, local drainage issues, and low elevation. 
Other  potential  sources  of  flood  information  include  local  planning  authorities,  media  reports,  historical 
records contained in public libraries and your own personal experience. Long-term residents can also be 
excellent sources of information on the history of flooding in your area. Predictions based on site-specific 
calculations performed by an engineering consultant can also be used as a guide.

Public Alerts are issued by Environment Canada for abnormally high water levels and high waves (storm 
surge or storm tide) caused by storms, which have the potential to cause coastal flooding:
