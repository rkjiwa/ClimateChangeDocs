Yukon ‘State of Play’:  
Analysis of Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation 
 
4.1.1  Adaptation to Flood Hazards 

November 14, 2017 

In Canada, flooding has surpassed theft and burglary as the largest single source of property 
insurance claims (Henstra, D. and Thistlethwaite, J., 2017). Mitigating flood hazard risk requires 
that we improve knowledge and awareness of what values (e.g. personal or commercial 
property, public infrastructure, industrial infrastructure, sites for traditional activities, etc.) are 
exposed to these risks, and what arrangements are currently in place to reduce vulnerability to 
flooding.  In 2016, Yukon government collected digital elevation data in 13 communities to 
identify what areas might be exposed to flooding at different water levels. This data is currently 
available online and is being used to create flood risk maps for use by residents, decision-makers 
and land-use planners.
