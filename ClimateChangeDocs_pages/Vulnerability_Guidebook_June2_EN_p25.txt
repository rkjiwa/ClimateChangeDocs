described as problems, in some situations in Canadian forests, climate change may create 
opportunities, with corresponding challenges for SFM to embrace the opportunities. 

Certain factors, or triggers, often influence the desire to initiate an SFM vulnerability 
assessment and adaptation planning process (see Appendix 2), including the following: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

•   past extreme weather and/or weather-related events (e.g., insect infestation, fire, 

flood, wind) that caused damage to forest resources or infrastructure

•   anticipated changes in climatic variability (e.g., increased frequency or magnitude of 

extreme weather-related events, changes to forestry operation seasons)

•  identified vulnerabilities (e.g., results of a scientific study or anecdotal evidence)

•  desire to adopt “best management practices” or to be an “early-adopter”  

•  funding opportunities for climate change vulnerability assessment or adaptation

•  desire to realize concurrent benefits (e.g., job creation, community sustainability)

•  pressure from interest groups or the public to account for climate change in plans

•  professional ethics

•  investor or insurance demands

•  risk perceptions and concerns of forest managers and the public.

Brainstorming how climate and climate change affect the system being assessed is an 
effective way to better understand the problems and challenges that might need to be 
considered (ICLEI 2010). The scoping step can be strengthened by explicitly considering 
the question, “What might be the consequences of not undertaking a vulnerability 
assessment and not adapting proactively to climate change?” (Williamson et al. 2012). 
This type of localized information can also provide concrete examples of why a climate 
change vulnerability assessment is needed. These examples can be valuable when seeking 
resources and commitment for the assessment.

If clear factors have prompted a vulnerability assessment of SFM and some benefits of an 
assessment have been defined, it may also be useful to clearly define why you wish to 
proceed with the assessment and what you hope to achieve. Developing well-defined 
purpose and outcome statements at this early stage can help focus the scope and 
participation level of the assessment. 

The outcome of defining the problem or challenge should be a direct statement that 
specifies the problem to be addressed, the purpose of the vulnerability assessment, and 
the expected outcomes of the assessment. 

1.2.2     The Practice
Although defining the climate change problem or challenge is crucial at the initiation of 
an effective climate change vulnerability assessment, this step is often not taken seriously. 
As a result, the focus for the assessment may be unclear, and relevant decision makers 
or interested parties may be omitted from the process. Lack of clear problem definition 
may also lead to an ever-expanding assessment, which may in turn result in a fatigue of 
resources, in terms of both financial support and participants’ attention.
