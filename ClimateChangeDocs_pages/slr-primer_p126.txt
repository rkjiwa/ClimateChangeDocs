This report classifies the coastline of the island of Newfoundland, focusing on the sensitivity of the 
coastline to erosion and petroleum contamination. It forms the first phase of a detailed study of the 
Newfoundland coastline. A subsequent report will discuss individual locations along the coast, based 
on field, office, and laboratory research conducted throughout the period from May 2010 through 2011, 
building upon research conducted since July 1989.

Classification.pdf
This report summarizes work undertaken by Coldwater Consulting Ltd. to develop shoreline classification 
and sensitivity mapping for the entire P.E.I. shoreline. The development of a shoreline classification system 
is a key step in being able to assess the effects of coastal hazards on the Island’s shorelines. Coastal hazards 
include: coastal flooding, coastal erosion, and damage to coastal ecosystems. All of these hazards are 
influenced by the combined actions of sea level rise, tides, storm surge and wave action.

Daigle, Réal. Sea-Level Rise and Flooding Estimates for New Brunswick Coastal Sections. Fredericton: Climate 

 

Change Secretariat, New Brunswick Department of Environment, 2012.
This report provides estimates of relative sea level rise over the coming century, including the storm surge 
component for return periods of 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 years, for the coastline of New Brunswick, based 
on the availability of tidal data information. The estimates of global sea level rise were used, in conjunction 
with the best estimates of local vertical motion (crustal subsidence) to calculate total sea level rise 
estimates over the next century for the coastlines of New Brunswick of 0.9 to 1.05 metres.

Scenarios%20NB%20Munic-2009.pdf
This report provides climate scenarios for 11 New Brunswick municipalities. The future periods used in 
this report are the 2020s (2011-2040), 2050s (2041-2070), and the 2080s (2071-2100). In the context of 
sea level parameters, the mid-point of the three future periods (2025, 2055 and 2085) was adopted as 
the representative year for each scenario period. 

 

Danard, M., A. Munro, and T. Murty. “Storm Surge Hazard in Canada.” Natural Hazards, 2003: 407-431.
 

This report identifies hazards from storm surge across Canada. Storm surges occur frequently in Canada 
mainly due to extra-tropical cyclones, also referred to as winter storms. Storm surges have occurred both on 
the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, St. Lawrence Estuary, Bay of Fundy, Hudson Bay, 
James Bay, Northwest Passage, Beaufort Sea, the Great Lakes and other large lakes such as Lake Winnipeg. 
The report notes that a high priority for proper assessment of storm surge hazard is the production of maps 
showing inundation zones for storm surges that might occur in populated coastal areas.
