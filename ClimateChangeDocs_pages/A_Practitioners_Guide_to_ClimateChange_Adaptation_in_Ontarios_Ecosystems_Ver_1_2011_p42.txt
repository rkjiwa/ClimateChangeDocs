Worksheet 4.2: Describing Other Future Existing Stresses 

Depending  on  what  non-climatic  existing  stresses  may  be  projected,  a  description  of  the  stresses  on  each  indicator  may  be 
qualitative  or  quantitative.  Assessments  can  consider  human  population  growth  patterns  in  the  project  area,  economic  shifts,  and 
historic  and  recent  land-use  changes. Wherever possible,  rank the  degree  of  sensitivity  to  the  stress  as  High (H),  Medium  (M), or 
Low (L).
