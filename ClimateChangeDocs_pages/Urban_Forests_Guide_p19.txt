Graduate students at the University of Northern B.C. have created a product called “Beetlecrete”. It 
combines flakes of blue beetle-killed wood with Portland cement to form a marbled material with the 
strength of concrete, but the look and feel of wood. 

The massive ceiling (200 ha) of the Richmond Oval, built for the 2010 Winter Olympics, is made of salvaged 
beetle-killed wood from interior B.C. forests.18

The B.C. Forestry Climate Change Working Group is working with the forest industry to explore options to 
use beetle-killed wood to generate bio-fuels. 

 
“We have seen a lot of symptoms of drought in recent years, e.g., native Douglas-fir mortality as well as 
drought symptoms on urban trees.” (City of Kelowna)19  

“Loss of western red-cedar and grand fir in areas where they were on the edge of their ecological niche… 
We have also seen a significant increase in the number of new invasive species.” (District of Saanich)20 

“…the boreal forest, predominant in the Burns Lake region, is expected to undergo an extensive reduction 
in size, as grasslands and temperate deciduous species may invade from the south, and northern expansion 
is limited by poor soils and insufficient sunshine amounts. Forest fires and pest infestations are expected to 
increase in frequency, area, and intensity due to warmer and drier conditions.” (Village of Burns Lake)21
