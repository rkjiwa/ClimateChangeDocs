in low-income neighbourhoods, are also particularly vulnerable to heat waves. In the case of 
flooding, lower-income households are less able to floodproof their property, purchase insur-
ance, or re-locate.40 Community members with health challenges will be affected differently by 
climate change, and their needs will require special attention.41

Transportation networks and hubs may be in vulnerable locations, meaning that they are sub-
ject to ongoing disruptions from climate change impacts that can have negative consequences 
for  any  economic  or  community  activities  that  rely  on  them.  An  adaptation  measure  might 
involve first identifying these vulnerable locations and then working, together with partners 
(e.g. Ministry of Transportation), as appropriate, to develop responses.

•	 Much of the most productive agricultural land in BC is located in areas that are also 

densely populated, creating pressures on agricultural uses. Through planning and land 
use regulation, local governments can help to protect agricultural 
lands and uses. See Deborah Curran, Protecting the Working Landscape 
of Agriculture www.wcel.org/issues/urban/sbg

•	 Community engagement around local food production is increasing 
in BC. See, for example, the Capital Regional District http://crd.bc.ca/

Kaslo Food Security Project http://nklcss.org/food.php; the  City of

Compromised water 
quality is a particular 
concern for the 
young, elderly and 
those with health 
conditions, and may 
result from climate 
change impacts such 
as increased run-off, 
landslides and warmer 
water temperatures.
