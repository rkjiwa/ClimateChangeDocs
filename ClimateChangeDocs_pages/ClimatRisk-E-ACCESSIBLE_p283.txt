HURRICANE HAZEL, GREATER TORONTO AREA, OCTOBER 1954

Hurricane Hazel, which hit the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) in October of 1954, may be Canada’s 
best-known weather-related urban disaster, and remains one of the most costly storms in the region’s 
history. A wet autumn season left Ontario’s soils supersaturated (Environment Canada, 2013a), 
which worsened the impact of 210 mm of rain that fell in a 36-hour period.  Severe flash floods 
killed 81 people (Toronto and Region Conservation Authority, 2016). Damages totaled $100 million 
(approximately $900 million in 2015 dollars), half of which was spent replacing damaged or destroyed 
transportation infrastructure (Robinson and Cruikshank, 2006). 

Disruptions to transportation systems were significant:

•  Many train routes were delayed or otherwise affected, and a CNR railcar was overturned 

(Environment Canada, 2013a). 

•  CNR reported a dramatic increase in train travel during the storm due to widespread road 

flooding. 14,000 people traveled by train during Hurricane Hazel, compared to the daily 
average of 1,000 (Environment Canada, 2013a), demonstrating the importance of redundant 
transportation options in maintaining mobility during extreme events. 

•  Major flooding and washouts occurred on Highways 400, 11, and 12, stranding motorists.  Sections 

of these highways, in the storm’s peak, were under approximately 1m of water. 

•  A total of 40 bridges were damaged and 10 were de-commissioned. Many bridges serving key 

arterials, including connections over the Don River, York Mills, and Bayview Avenue, were severed, 
causing considerable social disruption (Environment Canada, 2013a).

The GTA took adaptive action after Hazel to address the hurricane’s immediate effects and reduce 
vulnerability to similar future events. The city placed specific focus on emergency management 
policy and infrastructure decision-making. For example, the proposed location of Toronto’s Gardiner 
Expressway route was amended, elevating the roadway and setting it back further from the shore 
of Lake Ontario. This busy highway running through downtown Toronto, yet to be built in 1954, would
