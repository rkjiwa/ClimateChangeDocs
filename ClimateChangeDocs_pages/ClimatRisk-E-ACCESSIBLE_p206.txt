Figure 7: Observed snow cover duration for the period 1999-2010 (left panel) and projected (right 
panels) for horizon 2050 (2041-2070).  The observed average is calculated using the IMS 24 dataset 
(IMS Ice mapping System 24 km resolution) (National Ice Center, 2008). Future maps present the 
ensemble median (i.e., the median of all available projections) as well as the 10th and 90th 
percentiles (i.e., lower and higher bounds) of 19 future climate scenarios. Future climate scenarios 
were produced using the “delta” method calculated from the CMIP5 (Coupled Model 
Intercomparison Project Phase) (RCP 8.5) and applied to the observed data (see Charron, 2014).

With respect to freezing rain, this is a phenomenon that predominantly affects the Saint-Lawrence 
valley due to its morphology and position (Ressler et al., 2012).  While great progress has been made 
to improve knowledge in terms of the conditions likely to generate this type of event, it remains 
uncertain whether the number, duration and intensity of these events will change in Québec over the 
coming decades.
