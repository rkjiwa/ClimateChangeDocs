STREAMFLOW
AND LAKE
WATER LEVELS

(cid:129) Decreased annual mean streamflow, particularly

in Southern Canada

(cid:129) Trend toward lower water levels in upper Great

Lakes

(cid:129) Increases in monthly streamflow in March and

April; decreases in monthly streamflow for other
months

(cid:129) Earlier break-up of river ice and earlier spring

freshet

(cid:129) Earlier snowmelt and increases in spring
freshet peaks in snow-driven watersheds
(cid:129) Decreased low flow volumes in summer
(cid:129) Decreased Great Lakes levels

DROUGHT

(cid:129) Increased evapotranspiration and widespread

(cid:129) Decreased soil moisture in summer

drying trend in soil moisture over North
America since the middle 1950s

CYCLONIC
STORMS

(cid:129) Likely an increase in intense tropical storm

activity in some areas since 1970

(cid:129) Decrease in total number of storms but

increase in number of intense events

Climate Change and Sustainable
Development 

economic, 

social 

that  balances 

Sustainable development can be defined as an approach to
development 
and
environmental dimensions. This concept incorporates the
notion  that  for  continued  human  progress,  development
must  find  pathways  that  achieve  economic  goals,  find  a
balance with the physical environment and promote social
well-being,  while  using  political  strategies  to  reach  these
priorities. Linking the concept of sustainable development to
climate change provides an opportunity to explore long-term
societal responses to global environmental change. 

Since industrialization, we have been significantly increasing
the  concentration  of  GHGs  in  the  atmosphere.  Despite

technological progress and available clean technologies, we have
failed to reduce our environmental impact or drastically reduce
emissions. In many instances, development has placed more of
an  emphasis  on  present  and  short-term  well-being  at  the
expense of future generations. The significance of sustainable
development  options  in  increasing  capacities  to  adapt  and
reducing GHG emissions leads to an important message that
could help guide responses to climate change at the level of
local  governments: there  is  a  strong  link  between  climate
change, increasing GHGs and our development decisions.

Furthermore, only those responses to climate change that
meet the criteria of sustainable development and help build
resilient communities will be effective in the long-run. Our
current choices are not sustainable. Building more green roofs,
using hybrid cars and increasing habitable space to protect
communities from flooding are desirable changes, however,
they  will  have  little  impact  if  we  continue  to  drive  more,
