To consider:

•	 Mapping sensitive ecosystems within local government jurisdictions provides information 

that can be used to guide land use policies, such as Natural Environmental Development 
Permit Areas, minimum setbacks, restoration and enhancement activities, and others, and 
can also be used to establish a baseline for monitoring and evaluation of future climate 
impacts.

The City of Kelowna has been recognized for its work in ecosystem mapping and 
inventory. www.iclei.org/fileadmin/user_upload/documents/Canada/Individual_
Cases/Cities_and_Biodiversity_Case_Study_Series_en_kelowna.pdf

The City of Prince George has mapped climate change-related impacts on 
soil moisture and considered forest and sensitive ecosystem resilience. http://

The Ministry of the Environment has compiled information about species at risk and 
other issues of environmental concern broken down by region, along with guidance 
for environmental planning. Develop with Care: Environmental Guidelines for Urban and 
Rural Land Development in British Columbia www.env.gov.bc.ca/wld/documents/bmp/

As populations grow, there is increasing pressure to develop land in urban and agricultural 
areas. Understanding the services that healthy ecosystems can provide in urban areas, 
as well as ways that developed areas can contribute to healthy ecosystems will be key in 
identifying solutions.

The City of Surrey completed an Ecosystem Management Study that included 
a Green Infrastructure Opportunities Map that covers the entire city area. The 
map identifies both “hubs” — intact ecosystems — and “corridors” — physical or 
functional linkages between the hubs — and recognizes that both developed and 
undeveloped parts of the city can contribute to ecological sustainability.

Local governments can increase the resilience and adaptive capacity of ecosystems 
by improving the “connectivity” of natural landscapes within their jurisdictions, and 
allowing species the opportunity to shift to more suitable habitats as the climate 
changes. Biodiversity corridors can be established along rivers, roads, and trails.

Protecting natural ecosystems can help manage risks from natural disasters. A 
healthy forest ecosystem has a high capacity to absorb torrential rain, by reducing 
erosion, slowing run-off and reducing the risk of flash floods and mudslides. 
Natural vegetation and wetlands in coastal areas can reduce the impact of 
storm surges, and vegetation along waterways can help decrease the impact of 
flooding. Healthy forest ecosystems can also protect slopes from erosion and 
lessen the risk of landslides. www.countdown2010.net/2010/wp-content/uploads/

Climate change will mean increasing problems with invasive species in BC. The Invasive 
Species Council of BC has assembled research about invasive species in BC, and resources 
for community groups. www.bcinvasives.ca/
