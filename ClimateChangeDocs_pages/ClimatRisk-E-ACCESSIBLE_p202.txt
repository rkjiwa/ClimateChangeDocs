tracks extending outside of Quebec are under federal jurisdiction, whereas all other tracks are under 
provincial jurisdiction. Transportation of people is primarily provided by Via Rail Canada Inc., but also 
by the Québec North Shore and Labrador Railway, by Amtrak for sections in the southernmost part of 
the province that lead to the United States, and by commuter trains and tourist trains. 

Demand for rail services has increased somewhat since 2001, both for the transportation of goods and 
travelers (Réseau des chemins de fer du Québec, 2011). The rail network under provincial jurisdiction 
has grown in the last 20 years, from 564 kilometers of rail in 1993, to more than 1,700 km in 2015 
(Ministère des Transports du Québec, 2015a). 

2.4 AIR TRANSPORTATION 

The airline sector provides transportation for passengers, freight and other activities, such as 
aeromedical evacuations, ice patrols, aerial application of products and more. Regarding 
freight services, close to 146,000 tonnes, equivalent to $3.7 billion, were transported by the 380 air 
transportation companies in Quebec in 2010 (MTQ 2013a).

There are two international airports (Montréal and Québec City) and various regional airports, 
26 of which are owned by the Ministère des Transports (see Figure 2). There are also close to 150 
aerodromes, approximately 50 seaplane bases and approximately 50 heliports. 

Passenger air traffic in Quebec increased by 4% between 2013 and 2014, reaching 16.5 million 
passengers. (Statistics Canada, 2014). Passenger air traffic should continue to increase, according to 
2012-2022 forecasts.

3.0 A CHANGING CLIMATE8

Climate risks for the transportation sector (infrastructure and services) vary by location and season. 
These considerations are important to better understand the potential impacts of expected changes, 
as they could accentuate the sector’s vulnerabilities.

Québec’s large territory and varied topography (altitude of up to 1,652 m) help to create different 
climates (Ouranos, 2015).  These range from a cold and humid continental climate in the southern 
and eastern parts of the province to a sub-polar continental climate in the central regions, a polar 
tundra climate up north and more of a maritime climate in the coastal areas towards the Gulf of 
the Saint-Lawrence. All of Québec is affected by climate change and certain trends are already 
being observed. 

3.1 RISING TEMPERATURES

Since 1950, temperature trends for both average and extreme temperatures have shown an increase 
in practically all regions in Québec, with extreme cold temperatures showing the most significant 
change. Over the period 1951-2010, decreases were recorded in the number of cold days and 
cold nights as well as in the length of cold spells (Donat et al., 2013). A significant increase was also 
observed during this same period in the number of hot days, hot nights and length of heat spells.

Projections suggest that these trends will continue, with northern latitudes being even more affected. 
Moreover, warming trends will be more prominent for extreme minimum and maximum temperatures
