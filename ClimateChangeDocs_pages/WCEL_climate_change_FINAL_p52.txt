Some local governments may be reluctant to try new approaches to dealing with 
stormwater management, for example, because of a fear of liability. However, 
there are a number of ways to manage risks that can be explored. Relying 
on certificates from third parties such as engineers or architects, obtaining 
insurance, implementing pilot projects to evaluate performance, and “over-
engineering” to provide a back-up in case of failure are all possibilities. For more 
information see “The Liability Elephant” in the Green Infrastructure Guide: Issues,

BC’s Living Water Smart website includes information and resources for local governments, 
such as the Water Conservation Calculator, a tool for small water purveyors and local 
government conservation initiatives. http://livingwatersmart.ca/business/becoming_

Public education and citizen engagement can complement regulatory measures.

ELECTRONIC ARTs GREEN ROOF

Electronic Arts, the City of Burnaby and BCIT Centre for Architectural Ecology collaborated 
on a green roof project for a new studio facility in Burnaby. After construction BCIT 
monitored performance, and in 2007 it was found that the green roof delayed run-off 
for three hours and reduced peak flow by 90%. During the summer, temperatures of the 
membrane under the green roof fluctuated by 3°C instead of 41°C.
