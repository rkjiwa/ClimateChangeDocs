Expected Coastal Deepwater Storm Surges for BC 
Examination of the surges recorded along the BC coastline has shown that in many, if not in 
most cases, the deepwater surge generated in the North Pacific, after modification over the 
continental  shelf,  arrives  relatively  unchanged  at  all  stations  in  the  general  north  coast  or 
south coast areas of British Columbia.  An example of the storm surges recorded on the coast 
for a storm on 9 – 16 December 1995, is shown in Figure 2-4 and illustrates how the surge 
wave  retains  its  main  characteristics  all  the  way  from  its  arrival  on  the  west  coast  of
