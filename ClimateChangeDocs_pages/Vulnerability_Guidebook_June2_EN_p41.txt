 Identify Changes to Forest Management 
Practices Due to Recent Changes in Climate 

2.4.1     The Theory
SFM systems in Canada are inherently adaptable (Williamson et al. 2009). The forest 
sector has adapted to recent changes in markets by innovating new products for market, 
increasing efficiency of operations, and developing new forest management practices 
in response to new societal values (e.g., biodiversity). Given this inherent adaptability 
of forest management systems in Canada, it is likely they have already adapted to any 
recent changes in the climate (i.e., over the past decade or two) and any impacts these 
changes may have had on forests or forest operations, and it may be helpful to identify 
any such adaptations. For example, have forest policies or practices been adapted in 
response to outbreaks of mountain pine beetle or other pests associated with changes in 
climate? Have any changes been made to duration of winter harvest because of changes 
in frozen soil conditions or lake ice-in conditions (i.e., for winter roads)? Have there been 
any changes to the wildfire season (e.g., earlier start dates or later end dates) that have 
increased the length of time that wildfire crews are required on active duty? See “Case 
study –‘Climate change and Canada’s Forests’” for additional ways climate change is 
already affecting Canada’s forests.

2.4.2     The Practice
Examine your current SFM policies and practices and see if you can identify any changes 
(i.e., adaptations) that have been made as a result of recent changes to climate or climate 
variability. This activity can be done by a smaller assessment team or by engaging a 
broader audience in a workshop setting to gather tacit knowledge of changes that might 
not be well documented. You may want to start by identifying a recent unanticipated 
event (e.g., a large wildfire or insect outbreak, an extreme precipitation event, a market 
downturn) and then describing how that event affected your ability to manage forests 
sustainably and what changes to management practices or policies were made to 
account for the impacts of this event.

Record these observations in Worksheet 2.3 (Describe how recent climate trends or 
changes in forest conditions have led to changes in forest management practices).
