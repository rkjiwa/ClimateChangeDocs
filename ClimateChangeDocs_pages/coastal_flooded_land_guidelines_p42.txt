 

uncertainties in the future changes to storm surge, wave run-up, and the effects of sea level 
rise on delta flooding and coastal sediment supply. 
The Freeboard allowance should be the greater of: 
  0.6m, or; 
  For flood proofing fill – crest elevation of equivalent sea dike (see Sea Dike Guidelines 

2010) 

  For exposed vertical building foundations – the wave-structure interaction; 
  For tsunami areas – the runup elevation of the appropriate tsunami hazard. 
In  summary  the  general  concept  for  calculating  Future  Flood  Construction  Level  with  SLR 
Allowance is: 
  Future SLR Allowance + 
  Maximum High Tide (HHWLT) + 
  Storm Surge During Designated Storm + 
  Wave Effects During Designated Storm + 
  Freeboard Allowance 
The FCL calculation will vary for a given target year, and will vary for local areas in calculation 
of both High Tide as well as storm surge and wave effects.
