3. Donâ€™t be the cause

of a wild!re

Wild!res often start as small accidental ignitions. You can help prevent
an accidental wild!re from starting by using FireSmart standards
around your property.

FireSmart your chimney 
Chimneys should be constructed to
meet current building code requirements
and have approved spark arrestors
installed.

Burn barrels and !re pits 
Burn barrels and !re pits should be
located away from buildings and 3
metres away from other combustible
material. Always ensure your burn barrel
has proper ventilation and is covered
with a screen. Never leave your burn
barrel or !re pit unattended while it is in
use. For a safer method of disposal bring
your debris to a local land!ll site. 

Power lines and propane tanks 
Vegetation should be cleared away from
power lines, propane tanks and other
fuel supplies.

Emergency facilities 
Ensure your property has adequate
emergency vehicle access and an on-site
emergency water supply, such as a
pond, tank, creek or lake.
