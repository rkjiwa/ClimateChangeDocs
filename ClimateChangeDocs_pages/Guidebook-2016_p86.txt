SYNTHETIC SCENARIO

Table 8 |  List of nine what-if (synthetic) scenarios constructed to simulate changes in discharge along the Rivi√®res-des- 
Prairies, on the North shore of Montreal. Q2 and Q100 represent total annual discharges with a return period  
 
 
of 2 years and 100 years, respectively.
