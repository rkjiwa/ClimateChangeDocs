2.1 CLIMATE SENSITIVITY OF URBAN TRANSPORTATION

Much has been learned about how to adapt to severe weather across all modes of urban 
transportation in Canada. Some examples are explored in this section.  

REGINA CYCLONE, JUNE 1912

The Regina Cyclone, which occurred on June 12th, 1912, remains the most destructive tornado in 
Canadian history. It killed 30 residents, left 2500 homeless, and resulted in $1.2 million (approximately 
$25 million in 2015 dollars4) in property and infrastructure damage (Environment Canada, 2013a; 
Saskatchewan Archives Board, 2011). The damage was so significant that it took the municipality 
40 years to pay back the debts it incurred (Saskatchewan Archives Board, 2011). The loss of the 
Canadian Pacific Railroad freight depot was particularly detrimental. The cyclone flipped railcars and 
destroyed grain warehouses, flattening a keystone of Western Canada’s grain transportation network 
and affecting cities across the country that relied on western grain (Martin, 2012;). 

In the century since this event, emergency management and communication protocols have 
changed significantly (including the use of electronic and social media to warn operators and 
travelers of impending threats), and urban building codes and materials are much more resilient to 
wind and rain (Martin, 2012). While the damage and disruption associated with a similar event would 
likely be severe, the transportation and other infrastructure impacts of a tornado would not be as 
devastating today thanks to more stringent building codes and improved materials (Martin, 2012).

FRASER RIVER VALLEY FLOOD, SPRING 1948

An unusually rapid warming of a heavy mountain snowpack caused the Fraser River, in British 
Columbia, to flood in May and June 1948. Floodwaters engulfed 2,300 homes, leaving 16,000 
homeless and 10 dead (Robinson and Cruikshank, 2006). The estimated damage was $20 million 
(approximately $220 million in 2015 dollars) (Environment Canada, 2010). 

The network of dykes set up to protect the urban areas of Chilliwack, Mission, and New Westminster 
were considered adequate for minor flood protection, but were unable to withstand the flood’s 
high-water levels. On June 10, the river reached a peak height of 7.6 m in Mission, flooding streets 
and nearby highways, impeding vehicles, pedestrians, and two rail lines running through the town 
(McLean et al., 2007; Environment Canada, 2010). While only 0.5 percent of the 1,375-km floodplain 
is at risk of flooding today, this high-risk area includes a number of urban centres, and is home to two 
airports and key segments of highway and railway (Environment Canada, 2010).

Governments and decision-makers learned several lessons in the aftermath of the Fraser River floods. 
Better regional coordination, emergency planning, and awareness have catalyzed municipal, 
provincial, and federal governments to invest $300 million since 1948 to improve dykes and other 
flood-prevention measures in the region (to withstand a 200-year flood event); as a result, the 
adaptive capacity and resilience of these communities has been increased (McLean et al., 2007). 

While significant improvements in flood control have been made, the Fraser Valley’s urban regions 
face heightened risks to similar or more significant events in coming decades as a result of a changing 
climate.
