Structured Decision Making 

A process to plan for climate change adaptation 
may benefit from the application of concepts 
developed for decision analysis. A structured 
decision-making approach represents a useful 
way to guide the development, evaluation, 
implementation, monitoring, and mainstreaming 
of adaptation recommendations and strategies. 
Structured decision making provides a useful 
framework to assess when and where a particular 
adaptation option may be suitable. In relation to 
adaptation to climate change, structured decision 
making involves establishing management 
objectives for the future forest;  determining 
the vulnerability of forest ecosystems, forest 
communities, local economies, and human 
populations;  developing alternative adaptation 
options;  evaluating alternative options against 
management objectives;  implementing desired 
adaptation policies and practices;  monitoring 
the effectiveness of climate change adaptation 
efforts in achieving management objectives; 
and  modifying management practices when 
adaptation efforts are unsuccessful in meeting 
management objectives (e.g., adaptive 
management).  Articulating specific objectives 
may increase the success of planning processes in 
addressing long-term concerns within short-term 
decisions. This approach is consistent with the 
approach adopted in the CCFM report “Adapting 
Sustainable Forest Management to Climate 

Change: A Framework for Assessing Vulnerability 
and Mainstreaming Adaptation” (Williamson et al. 
2012).

Structured decision making has many similarities 
to the adaptation policy framework process 
suggested by the United Nations Development 
Programme. Both involve assessing current 
vulnerability, formulating adaptation strategies, 
and then implementing, monitoring, and 
improving the initiatives launched. Structured 
decision making places more emphasis on the 
articulation of management objectives and the 
evaluation of alternative options and strategies 
against these objectives. The adaptation policy 
framework process places more emphasis 
on who is involved in making the evaluation 
(strong stakeholder engagement), on the careful 
scoping of a project to ensure that it is well 
integrated into a policy and planning process 
(to foster implementation of results), and on 
enhancing adaptive capacity. Neither approach 
requires high-quality data or extensive modeling 
expertise, and both approaches encourage 
thoughtful assessment and a structured process.

et al. (2005); Williamson et al. (2012).
