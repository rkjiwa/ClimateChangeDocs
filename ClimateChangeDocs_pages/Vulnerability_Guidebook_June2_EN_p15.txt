0.3  About this Guidebook

Goal and Objectives
The intent of this guidebook is to provide practical guidance to forest resource 
professionals (practitioners and policy makers) who are applying the CCFM approach 
to vulnerability assessment and adaptation planning for SFM. This guidebook has the 
following attributes:

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

•   primarily targets forestry practitioners (at the operational and planning levels) but also 

recognizes the importance of supporting policy makers in mainstreaming climate 
change adaptation (see sidebar Definitions)

•   focuses on how to assess the vulnerability of SFM objectives to climate change and 

identify options for mainstreaming adaptation into decision making  

•   is relevant to both practice and policy but is not prescriptive

•   recognizes that there is no single best method for implementing the framework 

that will be suitable in all situations, given that capacity, resource availability,  
management, and climate change impacts all differ widely from region to region 
within Canada

•   shares key findings and lessons learned from early attempts at forestry-related 

vulnerability assessments in Canada (case studies)

•   provides a structured decision-making process for acquiring climate impact 

knowledge to help guide SFM adaptation decisions and actions  

•   provides a framework for maintaining a record of decision making, prompting users 
to document the reasoning behind changes to management policies and practices.

Overview
Each chapter in the guidebook corresponds to one of the components of the CCFM 
framework for assessing vulnerability and mainstreaming adaptation, as described in 
Williamson et al. (2012) and illustrated in Figure 0.1 (referred to as the framework). The 
framework is a general approach that can be used by forest resource professionals across 
Canada to identify how best to incorporate climate change considerations into SFM 
policies and plans. Each chapter is structured around a series of worksheets (presented in 
chapter 7) that are designed to assist users through the methodologies presented herein 
and to help them document the results and discussions of each assessment stage. A 
glossary is included to ensure common understanding of the terms used throughout this 
guidebook (see Appendix 1).

Each chapter contains the following elements:

 

 
 

•  Purpose and expected outcomes

•  Worksheets: 
 

-   Theory – provides background, based on the literature and practitioners’ experience, 

and theory for the guidance being provided 

Definitions

Forestry practitioners: 
Forestry practitioners 
are those responsible 
for operational activities 
and for developing forest 
management plans to 
achieve directions set  
at the strategic level.

Policy makers: Policy 
makers are those 
responsible for high-level 
or strategic-level plans 
to develop policies and 
programs that both facilitate 
and guide the work of  
forest practitioners.
