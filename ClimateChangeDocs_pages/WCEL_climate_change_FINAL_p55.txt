emeRgency mAnAgement PlAnning

Under  BC’s  Emergency  Program  Act  local  governments  are  obliged  to  prepare  a  local 
emergency management plan respecting “…preparation for, response to and recovery 
from emergencies and disasters.” As well, subject to any provincially-directed emergency 
measures, a local authority is at all times responsible for the direction and control of the 
local authority’s emergency response.

While  climate  change  is  not  specifically  mentioned  in  the  Act,  to  adequately  plan  for 
emergences and disasters local governments will have to assess the potential impacts 
of  climate  change  on  their  communities  in  terms  of  changed  and  possibly  increased 
risks. The Local Authority Emergency Management Regulation specifies that the local 
emergency management plan must take into account the “potential emergencies and 
disasters that could affect all or any part of the jurisdictional area for which the local 
authority has responsibility, and the local authority’s assessment of the relative risk of 
occurrence  and  the  potential  impact  on  people  and  property  of  the  emergencies  or 
disasters” and that it must be reviewed and updated periodically.

Why look at emergency planning as part of climate change adaptation:

Climate change will both exacerbate existing risks to people and property and create 
new ones, and local emergency planning needs to be reviewed in light of a hazard risk 
and vulnerability analysis that takes into account climate change impacts in the region.

Some examples of potential climate-related hazards include:

•	 More frequent flooding.

•	

The City of Grand Forks recently experienced two 1-in-100 year floods 
within five years. www.cbt.org/uploads/pdf/KImberley_CACCI_
