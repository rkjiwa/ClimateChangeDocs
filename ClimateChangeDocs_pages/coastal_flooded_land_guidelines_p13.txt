 

The FCL and Setback for a given site may vary at the point that a building has ended its planned 
lifespan.  
For  example,  a  building constructed  in  2010 with  a  90  year  lifespan would  meet  the  guideline  if 
sited  to  allow  for  SLR  of  1.0  m  minimum  over  Year  2000  levels  plus  or  minus  any  regional 
adjustments. When rebuilt in or about 2100 this building would need to accommodate FCL at the 
time, which might be 2.0m higher than Year 2000 levels, requiring that the building FCL be 1.0 m 
higher than approved in 2010. The actual required FCL in the year 2200 will not be known with 
accuracy until much closer to that date. 
In  the  building  example  above,  there  is  ongoing  economic  use,  with  the  costs  of  adaptation 
distributed through the centuries. 
This approach will minimize the initial costs of considering SLR, and the future costs of adaptation. 
Beyond examples of individual buildings, the SLR Planning Area approach described in Section 4 
provides a method to gradually adapt larger scale land use patterns to SLR including impacts on 
drainage, access and other factors affecting the land use.
