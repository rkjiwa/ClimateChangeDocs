Operational

Strategic considerations  

Have the vulnerability assessment team assess the options on the basis of their experience 
and knowledge, with the understanding that the team represents only a small proportion of 
the interested parties within the SFM system of interest.

Seek participation of and perspectives from a diverse group of interested parties (e.g., 
stakeholders, public, other government departments) in assessing potential conflicts and 
prioritizing adaptations.

Individuals responsible for forest planning, harvesting operations, and mill operations should 
be included in the assessment of suitability and feasibility. Individuals who work on these 
tasks daily often know the details required to implement new approaches and techniques. 
This step in the adaptation process can also be an opportunity for all interested parties to 
bring forward creative solutions and new opportunities. 

Don’t become overwhelmed by a lack of data or tremendous uncertainties. Use the 
information that is available, but also plan to rely on expert judgments and/or the informed 
judgments of local forest practitioners to develop recommendations and priorities. Look for 
“no-regret” adaptations (i.e., actions that make sense now and in the future, regardless of 
what the climate might be).

6.3  Mainstream Adaptation Priorities

6.3.1     The Theory
Now that you have developed a list of adaptation priorities, it is time to transform 
them into actions by incorporating them into the day-to-day operations of relevant 
organizations. Integrating adaptations into regular business practice is known as 
“mainstreaming.” This process also encourages all members of an organization to become 
knowledgeable about climate change and its potential impacts. 

Fundamentally, adaptation is about doing things differently. Implementation may require 
a change in ways of doing business, such as alterations in planning, procedures, policies, 
regulations, legislation, investments, protocols, guidelines, training, and operational 
methods. The changes may be minor and easily implemented, or they may be more 
significant and require careful planning and monitoring. Implementation will require 
mobilization of financial and human resources, as well as ongoing, effective partnerships 
with agencies and other organizations that may be involved in, or affected by, 
implementation of the adaptation measures.

If the individuals who will be responsible for and involved in implementing the 
adaptations have been engaged in the earlier stages of vulnerability assessment, they 
should already know the reasons why adaptations are needed. If they have not had an 
opportunity to learn about climate change impacts or how and why specific adaptations 
were chosen, they will need to be brought up to speed, to facilitate their support and 
ensure effective implementation of the adaptations. Moser and Ekstrom (2010) have 
summarized the barriers to implementation of adaptation options and some options for 
overcoming them. 

From the assessment 
framework…
“Adaptation means a 
change in the way of doing 
business. Implementation 
of an adaptation may 
therefore require changes in 
planning, procedures, policies, 
regulations, legislation, 
investments, protocols, 
guidelines, standards, and 
operational methods. However, 
implementation does not 
encompass any change  
in SFM objectives.””
