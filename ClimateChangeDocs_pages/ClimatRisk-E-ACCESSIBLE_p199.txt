2.1 ROAD TRANSPORTATION 

Road transportation is one of the most flexible and accessible modes and is proving to be the 
preferred mode for short-distance, inter-regional and inter-provincial transportation of goods and 
people (Ministère des transports du Québec, 2013b). In addition to ensuring access to much of 
Quebec, road infrastructure facilitates intermodal connections with rail terminals, ports and airports 
(CPCS, 2013).

There are approximately 319,000 km of roads in Quebec, including highways, national roads, 
collector roads, streets, bridges and overpasses, access roads and local roads (Ministère des 
Transports du Québec, 2015b; see Figure 3). There are also more than 300,000 kilometers of multi-use 
roads in forest settings. 

Aging of infrastructure increases its vulnerability and maintenance costs. The average age of 
infrastructure provides a means of evaluating the condition of the network and the need for investments 
to ensure its maintenance. Reinvestment in this area since the early 2000’s has reduced the average 
age of roads in Quebec from 18 years in 2000, to 13 years in 2009 (Gagné and Haarman, 2011). 

Certain regions are heavily dependent on a single road link for their regular supply and mobility 
needs. Accessibility to these regions could be significantly compromised after a major weather event 
(e.g., flood, landslide, erosion etc.,) causes damages to the road link.

Although user behaviour is often the cause of accidents, the contribution of weather conditions must 
also be considered in road safety management (Andrey, 2010). Moreover, the number of collisions 
increases during times of precipitation (Andrey and Mills, 2002). However, the number of road 
accidents has been on the decline since 2007, in Quebec and elsewhere in Canada.
