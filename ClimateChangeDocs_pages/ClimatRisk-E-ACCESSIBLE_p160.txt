3.0 CLIMATE TRENDS AND PROJECTIONS 

This section provides a brief overview of some observed and projected changes in Ontario’s climate 
in order to convey the direction and magnitude of future changes. More detailed information is 
available from several sources, including the Ontario Centre for Climate Impacts and Adaptation 
Resources and the Ontario Climate Consortium.

3.1 OBSERVED CLIMATE TRENDS 

Throughout Ontario, mean annual surface air temperatures have increased by a range of 
approximately 1.0-1.5°C from 1948 to 2012, while central and northern regions experienced slightly 
larger increases (Vincent et al., 2015). The greatest warming has occurred in winter. Reflecting these 
warmer winters, average annual ice cover throughout the Great Lakes declined by 71 percent from 
1973 to 2012 (Kahl and Stirrat, 2012). 

Annual total precipitation also increased in Ontario from 1948 to 2012, with the most significant 
increases occurring in the North (Vincent et al., 2015). Snow cover and annual snowfall (as a 
proportion of precipitation) has decreased in all regions, with the most significant declines in the 
central and northern sub-regions (Vincent et al., 2015).

It is generally more difficult to recognize changes in extreme weather (i.e. frequency of intense wind, 
rain, and heat events) than changes in average conditions, although the relationship between 
increased air temperatures and storm intensity is well-documented (Zwiers and Kharin, 1998; Westra et 
al., 2015).  Analysis in trends of short-duration extreme rainfall for Canada (research including regional 
and provincial analysis for Ontario) shows that increasing trends are more common than decreasing 
trends, and that many increases are statistically significant (Shepherd et al., 2014). 

The Great Lakes are not considered susceptible to sea level rise, given their respective elevations 
above sea level (74 metres in the case of Lake Ontario and 183 metres for Lake Superior) coupled 
with the lakes’ outward flow to the Atlantic Ocean (see Figure 4). However, water levels in the Great 
Lakes are prone to fluctuation. Levels below long-term monthly means were witnessed from 1997 to 
2012 (Shlozberg et al, 2014); however, the cold winters of 2013 and 2014 (which featured extensive 
winter lake-ice coverage and cooler temperatures) broke this trend, with water-level increases 
in all lakes (Dorling and Hanniman, 2016; Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory, 2015). 
Regardless, the long-term impacts of climate change on water levels will not be clear for some time, 
as results of the International Upper Great Lakes Study suggest that “natural variability” in Great Lakes 
water levels may mask the effects of climate change over the next 30 years (Brown et al., 2012).
