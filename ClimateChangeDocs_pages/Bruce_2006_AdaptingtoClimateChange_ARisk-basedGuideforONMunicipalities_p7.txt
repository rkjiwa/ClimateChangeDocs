The Earth’s climate is naturally variable due to a 
number of factors, including the presence of 
naturally occurring greenhouse gases (GHG) in 
the atmosphere. The Intergovernmental Panel 
on Climate Change concluded that, up until the 
mid1960s, the Earth’s warming was attributable 
to both human-caused and natural factors, but 
since about 1970, the Earth’s warming is 
attributed almost exclusively to increased 
atmospheric GHG concentrations from human 
activities.  
Given the current concentrations and the 
persistence of GHGs, and the projected further 
increases in GHG concentrations, it seems 
certain that the climate will continue to change.  
International efforts to reduce GHGs, such as 
the Kyoto Protocol, will only slow the rate of 
change.  Thus, adaptation is an essential 
response to ensure that society is not unduly 
adversely affected by climate change impacts.  
But adaptation to what?  Some people 
mistakenly believe that climate change is simply 
a gradual global warming.  It is increasingly 
evident that other aspects of climate are 
changing, too, especially the frequency and 
intensity of extreme weather events.  These two 
changes, the general warming and the 
increased climate variability, have significant 
implications for many aspects of our sustainable 
livelihoods.

Many social systems are already vulnerable to 
various climate-related and non-climate-related 
risks.  Projected climate changes will exacerbate 
many of these pre-existing vulnerabilities.  
Adaptation measures to reduce these 
vulnerabilities are increasingly urgent.

2.1  Climate trends and projections 

for Ontario 

Over the last 35 years, Ontario’s climate has 
changed in a number of ways.  Some of the 
changes in southern Ontario’s climate are 
presented in Table 1.  It is instructive to compare 
recent climate trends to those projected for the 
coming decades, to consider whether modeled 
projections can reliably inform adaptation 
decision-making.

The municipal planning 
context 

Municipal and conservation authority staffs are 
accustomed to dealing with climate-related 
issues in the course of their planning and 
management activities.  For example, they 
manage water supplies, design drainage 
systems and flood protection, design and 
implement heat and smog alert systems, and 
control mosquitoes and other disease vectors.   
But dealing with climate change is new and may 
be unfamiliar. Because it is a relatively new 
subject, the implications of climate change are 
not well understood across departments in many 
municipalities.  As yet, there are few staff 
appointments explicitly responsible for adapting 
to climate change.  Most municipal strategic or
