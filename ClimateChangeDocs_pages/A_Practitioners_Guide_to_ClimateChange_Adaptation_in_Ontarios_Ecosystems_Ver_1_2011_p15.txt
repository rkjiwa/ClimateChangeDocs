Developing  meaningful  adaptation  strategies  requires  an  understanding  of  the  vulnerabilities  of  species,  ecosystems,  and  social 
systems to climate change. Vulnerability assessments can support adaptation planning in many ways:  

 

 

 

 Identify species and/or ecosystems 
most likely to be most impacted by 
projected changes in climate;  

 Build an understanding of why these 

species and/or ecosystems are 
vulnerable, including the interaction 
between climate change, non-climatic 
stressors, and cumulative impacts;  

 Assess the efficacy of previous coping 
strategies in the context of historic and 
current changes in climate; and 

 Identify and target adaptation measures 

to systems with the greatest 
vulnerabilty.

Assessing  species’  and  ecosystems’  vulnerability  to  climate  change  is  a  complex  task.  In  addition  to  the  complexity  of  the 
interactions of various components of the ecosystem, assessing climate change vulnerability  involves understanding the degree of 
and  interaction  between  exposure,  sensitivity,  and  adaptive  capacity  to  climate  change  in  a  system,  as  well  as  other  non-climatic 
stresses. Each of these determinants of vulnerability is dynamic: they can vary over time, by type, and by stimulus, and can be place- 
and system-specific (Smit and Wandel, 2006).
