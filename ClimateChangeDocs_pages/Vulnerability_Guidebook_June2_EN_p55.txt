Before you begin:
It will be helpful to revisit the 
general assessment process 
and definitions of terms used 
in vulnerability assessments; 
see the sidebar SFM Climate 
Change Vulnerability 
Assessment. 

Also, it is recommended that 
you read Williamson and 
Isaac (2013), which provides 
additional background and 
theory for the adaptive 
capacity section of this 
chapter.
