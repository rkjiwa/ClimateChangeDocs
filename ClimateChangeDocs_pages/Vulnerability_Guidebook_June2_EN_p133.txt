Worksheet 5.2.   Develop potential adaptation options for the 

overall SFM system of interest

In this worksheet you will develop options to reduce SFM system vulnerabilities or 
increase SFM system-wide adaptive capacity.

Refer back to Worksheet 4.4 (Assess overall SFM system vulnerability) and 
consider whether there are options that could be implemented to reduce SFM system 
vulnerabilities or increase SFM system-wide adaptive capacity. Such options would 
span many or all SFM objectives (e.g., increased partnerships and collaborations with 
governments, research institutes, and stakeholders or interested parties; new approach to 
decision making within your organization).

Assess these broader options according to a scale of the importance of implementation of 
each option for achieving SFM objectives. The following scale could be used to rate these 
options:  VI = very important, I = important, N = not important, ? = importance unknown.

Identify adaptation options that are more generally important (e.g., those that are robust, 
no-regret, winâ€“win, and must-do).
