Backwater valves
A backwater valve is a device that prevents wastewater in an 
overloaded sewer (known as surcharging) from backing up into 
your basement.
The valve allows wastewater to flow from your home to the 
wastewater main during normal use. It will automatically close 
if wastewater backs up from the sewer main into your home 
(reversal mode), and is designed to protect the basement and 
reduce the risk of potential flooding.  The backwater valve 
also allows the flow of free air and outflow of wastewater for 
normally open valves.
Older backwater valves typically employed the normally closed 
type (Figure B). If there is no wastewater produced from a 
home, the flapper valve is closed under gravity, preventing 
backwater effects. However, these devices have been known 
to experience more maintenance issues, such as paper being 
caught in the flapper, holding it open. Therefore, this type of 
valve is no longer permitted under the Ontario Building Code 
for use in homes.
The current option is a normally open backwater valve. These 
valves remain open during normal use of water in the home and 
typically require less maintenance. Newer devices, such as the 
Mainline Fullport unit shown in Figure A, have the additional 
benefit of a clear top so that you can view the operation of the 
backwater valve. It is also equipped with an easily accessible 
cleanout. This is required in case there is a need to clean or 
clear your lateral from tree roots or other blockages.

Types of  
backwater valves

There are typically two types 
of backwater valves, “normally 
open” or “normally closed”.  
The images below represent 
the two types.

Figure A shows a normally open 
backwater valve and Figure B shows 
a normally closed backwater valve.

Location of backwater valves
Backwater valves are typically found in basements. There are 
several key advantages to having a backwater valve located in 
the home, including:
• Easy access
• Easier maintenance
• Homeowners can see if surcharging  

(wastewater backing up) occurs

• Lower cost to install
• Lower operating and maintenance costs
