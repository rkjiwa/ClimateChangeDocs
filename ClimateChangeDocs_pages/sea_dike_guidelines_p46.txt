 

The resulting crest elevations in Table 1-2 show clearly how careful evaluation of the acceptance 
criteria for overtopping volumes of water is critical to the design of a sea dike that can be expected 
to provide the required degree of safety to the community located behind the dike. 
Changes to the dike cross-section, including details of the toe protection that might be considered, 
the slope of the seaward and landward faces and the surface treatment of both slopes will result in 
different crest elevations from those presented in Table 1-2. 
 

1.3.3  Conceptual Dike Arrangement 

An example dike cross-section for the year 2100, as per Table 1-2 above, is shown below in Figure 
1-13  where  the  range  of  dike  elevations,  not  including  a  freeboard  allowance,  is  indicated  for 
overtopping  acceptance  criteria  of  1  L/s/m  and  10  L/s/m.    The  example  section  is  positioned 
directly over the crest of the existing dike for illustration purposes only.
