 F Are there initiatives to reduce the volume and rate of surface water entering the 

drainage system (e.g. source controls, bylaws and policies that minimize the creation 
of impervious areas)?

 F Have incentives for disconnecting downspouts been explored, and is this practice 

viable (i.e. does the soil have adequate capacity to absorb water) and have other 
mitigative measures like topsoil requirements and rain gardens been evaluated?

 F Have design criteria been adjusted to address climate change (e.g. updated 

Intensity-Duration-Frequency Curves)?

 F If there is a combined stormwater sewer system, how will climate change affect 

overflows? Is there increased risk to the environment or public health? Will upgrades 
such as sewer overflow tanks or a sewer separation program be considered?

 F In areas vulnerable to increased flooding as a result of climate change:

 F Would measures to promote the installation of backflow valves by residents and 

businesses be appropriate?

 F Is there a flood plain management bylaw and should it be updated to reflect 

changing precipitation patterns?

 F Are issues related to increased debris and sediment accumulation being considered?

 F Will waterlogged soils need to be addressed?

 F Are tools such as the Water Balance Model’s climate change module being used to assist in 

adaptation planning? http://bc.waterbalance.ca/

 F If alternate water supply sources are being planned for, will there be adequate energy 

available for increased pumping demands?

 F Will street lighting and public waste and recycling receptacles be vulnerable to climate 

change (e.g. increased wind and more severe storms)?

 F Are homeowners and businesses aware of the actions they can take in light of climate 

change impacts affecting water supply? (See Okanagan Homeowner’s Guide to Using Rain as a 
Resource www.okwaterwise.ca/pdf/HomeDrainageGuide_Okanagan.pdf)

 F Are urban trees at increased risk from wildfire, invasive species, water shortages, extreme 
weather events, etc.? Should other species that are more heat/drought/moisture tolerant 
be considered for future plantings? Is a greater diversity of tree species needed to assure 
resilience to pests and invasive species that might be associated with climate change? (See 
Urban Forests: A Climate Adaptation Guide www.retooling.ca/_Library/docs/Urban_Forests_
Guide.pdf)
