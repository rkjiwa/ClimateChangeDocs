Model Type 

Description 

For more information 

Conceptual models 

 Qualitative descriptions and diagrams of key attributes and 

 

processes related to species, habitats, or ecosystems  
 Can illustrate important linkages to stressors and how 

changes in stressors affect important attributes (e.g., soil 
texture) and functions (e.g., nutrient uptake, water flux). 

General 
characterization 
models 

 

 Represent broad groups (e.g., amphibians, riparian species) 
or generalized traits to identify how groups of species might 
respond to climate and/or habitat change by applying the 
classes of vulnerability to species distribution maps. 

 Another characterization approach involves meta-analyses 

that collate information to estimate common responses of 
species (especially effective at validating responses over 
large areas) (e.g., CCFM Tree Vulnerability Ranking Index 
and NatureServe Climate Change Vulnerability Index).  

 For a review of conceptual model development, see 
Heemskerk, Wilson, and Pavao-Zuckerman (2003). 

 Various types of conceptual modelling tools and 

software can be found at

odel.html).  

 NatureServe Climate Change Vulnerability Index:

ge/ClimateChange.jsp). 

 

Habitat and occupancy 
models 

 

 

 Expressed as ranges in specific biophysical attributes (e.g., 
climate, soils, vegetation or land cover, and elevation) that a 
species will occupy (e.g., suitable habitat).  

 Software used to develop niche and occupancy 

models can be downloaded from the Internet:  

 Genetic Algorithm for Rule-set Production (GARP)  

 Uses GIS to determine the spatial distribution of suitable 

(http://www.nhm.ku.edu/desktopgarp/);  

habitat for individual species. 

 Maximum Entropy Modeling (Maxent) 

 Niche-based models are also used to estimate species 

(http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~schapire/maxent/);  

distributions and habitat suitability: they generally involve 
more quantitative approaches with estimates of the 
probability of occurrence of a species. 

 Regression Trees and Random Forests 

(http://rattle.togaware.com/rattle-download.html); and 
 Bioclim (http://software.informer.com/getfree-bioclim-
