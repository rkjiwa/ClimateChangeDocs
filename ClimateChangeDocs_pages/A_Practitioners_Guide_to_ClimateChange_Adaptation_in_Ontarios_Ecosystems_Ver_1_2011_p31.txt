Assessing Current Non-climatic Stresses 

Assessing  the  vulnerability  of  species  and  ecosystems  to  climate  change  should  also  recognize  the  influence  of  non-climatic 
stresses.  This  assists  in  clarifying  the  relationships  between  various  species  and  ecosystems,  and  their  vulnerabilities  to  current 
climatic  and  non-climatic  factors  and  stresses;  it  also  helps  to  provide  a  foundation  for  the  assessment  of  future  vulnerabilities. 
Looking  at  climate  change  in  isolation  from  the  impacts  of  other  stresses  on  a  system  may  result  in  a  failure  to  recognize  the 
cumulative and synergistic effects that result from the interaction between climate change and other factors. 

In some cases, there will be human activities that contribute to system stresses, such as changes to population and demographics, 
economic growth or diversification, land-use, or market fluctuations.
