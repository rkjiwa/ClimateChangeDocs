To assist in determining what climate model inputs are required for the analyses, consider the following questions: 

 

 

Climate model considerations (sample) 

What climate models and scenarios are available? 

What climatic variables do assessment team 
experts require (e.g., minimum and maximum 
monthly temperatures, annual mean temperature, 
annual precipitation, growing season length in 
days, and isothermality)? 

In what format do assessment team experts 
require climate projection data and information? 
(e.g., maps, and tabular data)? 

What projection scale(s) are preferred? 

How should the data be presented (e.g., 
percentage change, and incremental change)?
