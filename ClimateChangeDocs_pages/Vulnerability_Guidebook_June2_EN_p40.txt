From the assessment 
framework…
“Assessing current climate and 
forest conditions is an important 
step in the vulnerability 
assessment framework because 
it allows managers to describe 
what they know with some 
certainty.”

—Williamson et al. (2012)

 Determine Relationship of Climate to Current 
Forest Conditions and Forest Ecosystem 
Processes

2.3.1     The Theory
Climate is a fundamental driver of forest ecosystems and therefore influences many forest 
management activities. Understanding how climate influences current forest conditions 
(e.g., species composition and productivity) and ecosystem processes (e.g., fire and insect 
disturbances, regeneration, nutrient cycling) is critical to forest management planning 
and operations (see “Case study – Canadian Forest Service Forest Change Initiative”). 
Exploring these relationships at this stage of the vulnerability assessment can help create 
an understanding about why current forest management practices have been established 
or current policies instituted and how these policies and practices may have changed in 
response to recent changes in climate and weather. Additionally, highlighting key linkages 
between climate and forest conditions can assist in the development of future forest 
impact scenarios (chapter 3).

2.3.2     The Practice
Take a close look at your current forest management policies and practices to see how 
climate has influenced the decisions made during implementation of these policies 
and practices (e.g., growth and yield projections, seasonal operation plans, silvicultural 
operations). You may also draw on the knowledge of forest practitioners, local residents, 
or academic researchers to help identify the relationships of climate to current forest 
conditions and processes. Use Worksheet 2.2 (Describe the relationships among 
climate, forest conditions, and forest management practices) to list the relationships 
of climate to forest conditions and of forest conditions to management practices (see 
Appendix 4 for examples of forest conditions and ecosystems processes to consider).

Case Study –  Canadian 
Forest Service “Forest 
Change” initiative

Forest Change is a new Canadian Forest Service initiative for enhancing forest-sector 
competitiveness in a changing climate. The initiative has three main deliverables:

   • 

 a tracking system to report indicators of climate change impacts on forests and the 
forest sector in Canada 

   •  an adaptation toolkit for SFM under a changing climate

   • 

 an integrated assessment of the implications of climate change for Canada’s forests and 
forest sector, to inform policies and investment by the public and private sectors.

These deliverables aim to generate the most current knowledge about climate change 
impacts on Canada’s forests and to make this knowledge available to practitioners in usable 
and accessible formats.
