Figure 3-1: Projections of Sea Level Rise 

source: Policy Discussion Paper (2010) 

 

 

Figure 3-1 illustrates the range of uncertainty in projections, showing a median projection, as well 
as a range in projections from low to high. The uncertainty increases into the future. As described  
in the policy document: Policy Discussion Paper 20103, it is recommended that sea dike design 
and assessment be based on the Recommended Curve for Sea Level Rise Policy in BC, shown on 
Figure 3-1. 
Unless  scientific  information  warrants  an  earlier  review,  the  Recommended  Curve  should  be 
updated in five years and then again by 2025, as well as at least once every 25 years thereafter. 
Regional Sea Level Rise 
Global  sea  level  rise  expectations  must  be  adjusted  to  account  for  regional  variations  and  for 
crustal movements particular to the area under consideration.  Regional variations to be considered 
include: 
  Variations particular to the Pacific Ocean Basin and to the NW Pacific portion;6 
  Variations particular to coastal British Columbia waters; 
  Local  variations  caused  by  crustal  movement,  leading  to  land  uprising  or  subsidence,  which 

may offset or exacerbate the sea level rise. 

The BC Sea Level Report (2008) provides the most recent summary of expected regional or local 
climate change effects on sea level rise.  Recommended local variations for crustal movement are 

                                                      
6 Available satellite measurements of recent sea level rise show considerable variation around the globe compared to 
the often quoted global means. Specific information on the regional variation expected over the North Pacific and 
offshore coastal British Columbia during upcoming climate change is not as readily available at this time.  This 
regional effect remains an element of uncertainty.
