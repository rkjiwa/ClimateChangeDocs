TABLE 5.   EXAMPLES OF ADAPTATION ACTIONS THAT IF DESIGNED CAREFULLY COULD BE TURNED INTO SAM

ACTIONS AND EXAMPLES OF MALADAPTATIONS 

WATER
SECTOR

FORESTRY,
FARMING AND
RANCHING

(cid:129) Establishing a second layer of setback flood defence behind original barriers - this approach is

often used with managed realignment

(cid:129) Widening drains to increase drainage capacity 
(cid:129) Raising dikes
(cid:129) Removing ‘pinchpoints’ from flood pathways to allow heavy rainfall to drain efficiently
(cid:129)
(cid:129)
(cid:129) Developing separate drainage systems for surface and foul water so surface water can directly

Setting back river edge flood defences to make space for water 
Inserting one way valves into drains and sewage pipes to prevent backflow

return to watercourses, reducing water treatment efforts

(cid:129) Dredging and widening of rivers
(cid:129) Allowing rivers to expand into side channels and wetland areas
(cid:129) Flushing drainage systems
(cid:129) Directing downspouts to lawns to encourage infiltration
(cid:129)

Increasing depression and street detention storage

(cid:129) Use drought resistant varieties or clones to reduce vulnerability of trees to drought and water stress
(cid:129) Enhance soil organic matter content to increase moisture retention and soil fertility thereby

reducing vulnerability to drought and moisture stress

(cid:129) Promote regeneration of native species through the protection of degraded natural forest lands
(cid:129) Promote multi-species plantation forestry incorporating native species in place of monoculture

plantation of exotic species

(cid:129) Alter hardwood/softwood species mix
(cid:129) Adopt short rotation species in commercial or industrial forestry
(cid:129)
(cid:129) Adapt strategies to control insect damage (e.g. prescribed burning, non-chemical insect control,

Incorporate multiple silvicultural practices

(cid:129)

adjusted harvesting schedules, thinning)
Incorporate fire protection measures to reduce vulnerability of forests to fire hazard due to
warming and drought

(cid:129) Alter species density and management intensity
(cid:129) Change location of production
(cid:129) Change product use practices
(cid:129) Control stresses other than those from climate change
(cid:129)
(cid:129) Apply land restoration practices to reduce flood/mudslide risk
(cid:129)
(cid:129) Access seasonal climate forecasts (e.g. farmers can use highly detailed information on weather
conditions to adjust crop and variety selection, irrigation strategies and pesticide application) 

Improve knowledge regarding forests’ responses to climate change

Salvage dead timber

(cid:129) Encourage purchase of insurance or create local financial pools to cover impacts of climate change

and extreme weather events

(cid:129) Adjust silvicultural treatment schedules to suit climate variations
(cid:129) Apply rotation method of irrigation during water shortages
(cid:129) Alter fertiliser rates to maintain grain or fruit quality consistent with the climate
(cid:129)
(cid:129) Alter mix and/or diversity of species
(cid:129) Employ species able to cope with possible changes and stresses, including 

Shift location of production

(cid:129) Drought and heat shock resistant species 
(cid:129) Cultivars that require longer times to mature (i.e. crops tend to mature faster under warmer

(cid:129)

climates, thus resulting in less time available for carbohydrate accumulation and grain production) 
If the particular climate scenario considered consists of both warmer and drier conditions,
longer-maturing cultivars, which require sufficient precipitation over the extended growing
season to sustain grain filling, will not likely work

(cid:129) Cultivars with a reduced need for vernalization (i.e. the requirement for set periods of cold

temperatures during the vegetative stages of crops to induce bud formation in spring)
