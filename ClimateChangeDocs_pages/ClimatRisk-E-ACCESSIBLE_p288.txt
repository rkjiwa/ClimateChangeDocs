AIR TEMPERATURE

Average air temperature in Canada increased by 1.5˚C from 1950-2010, and is projected to increase 
by about 1.5-2.5˚C by mid-century (in a low-emissions scenario), with increasing frequency of 
extreme heat and decreasing frequency of extreme cold (Bush et al., 2014). In cities, these trends are 
exacerbated by the urban heat-island effect, referring to the difference between surface and air 
temperatures (typically 10-15˚C for surfaces and 1-3˚C for air) in urban centres and surrounding rural 
areas. The heat island effect occurs due to a combination of factors (Figure 9), including: 

• 

• 

• 

The lack of vegetation in cities (which regulates temperature);

The low solar-reflective capacity of urban infrastructure;

The high heat-absorbance of urban materials (e.g., black asphalt) – highly-developed areas have 
less surface moisture available for evapotranspiration (which cools surrounding air) than natural 
ground cover, due to impervious surfaces like pavement and concrete (75-100 percent cover in 
most cities);

•  Anthropogenic (human-caused) heat production (e.g., air conditioning, vehicles, industrial 

activities); and, 

•  Urban topography (e.g., narrow streets limit the capacity of buildings to radiate heat at night and 

limit the passage of cooling winds) (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2008). 

Urban heat islands have implications for the integrity of transportation infrastructure, particularly 
pavement. Figure 10 provides an example of an urban heat island map for Montreal, Quebec.

in urban, rather than suburban or rural areas, likely owing to the ‘heat island’ effect. (Source: Natural
