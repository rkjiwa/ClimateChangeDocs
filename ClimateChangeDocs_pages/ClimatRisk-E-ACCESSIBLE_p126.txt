While trends in total precipitation remain poorly defined, the annual number of days experiencing 
precipitation has increased. Heavy precipitation events show no strong trend, with sites recording 
both increases and decreases in the number of heavy precipitation days for the period from 1950 to 
2010 (Bush et al., 2014). Like other sites in southern Canada, the Prairies are experiencing a decrease 
in the snow-to-rain ratio (Mekis and Vincent, 2011). While no trend is evident in the frequency and 
severity of drought in the Prairies over the 20th century (Bonsal et al., 2011), global analysis shows a 
trend towards more severe drought conditions over Western Canada during the second half of the 
20th century (Dai, 2011; Seneviratne et al., 2012).
