objectives and there is no potential adaptive capacity, the system has high vulnerability. 
A high level of vulnerability may lead to significant adverse effects on natural and human 
systems. 

The outcomes of a vulnerability assessment consist of relative vulnerability rankings and 
a documented understanding of the specific factors contributing to this vulnerability. 
Glick et al. (2011) emphasized that a vulnerability assessment is not an end point; rather, 
it is a source of information to be incorporated into planning and decision making. They 
described vulnerability rankings as an intermediate step, used in setting management and 
planning priorities and crafting adaptation options, including monitoring and allocating 
scarce resources. 

4.4.2     The Practice
Assessing the vulnerability of SFM objectives is a subjective practice based on the best 
available information and knowledge of potential impacts on the objectives and the 
assessment of general adaptive capacity. There is no exact science for this process, and it 
is best to work in a group or to conduct a workshop to estimate the vulnerability of your 
SFM objectives.

Worksheet 4.3 (Assess current and future vulnerability) combines the impacts on 
SFM objectives determined in Worksheet 4.1 (Assess current and future impacts on 
SFM) and the assessment of adaptive capacity from Worksheet 4.2 (Evaluate adaptive 
capacity of the SFM system) to determine the vulnerability of SFM objectives under 
current forest conditions and future forest impact scenarios. For example, if the impacts of 
climate change on achieving a specific SFM objective are ranked as high and the adaptive 
capacity of the system for this objective is ranked as low, vulnerability would be ranked as 
high. 

It is also useful to step back from the level of individual SFM objectives and examine the 
SFM system as a whole, considering the question, “Under current forest conditions and 
the range of potential future climate and forest impacts, is the SFM system vulnerable 
to climate change?” Use Worksheet 4.4 (Assess overall SFM system vulnerability) to 
summarize your conclusions.

4.5  Decision Point: Is Adaptation Required?

At this stage, the detailed vulnerability assessment is now complete. You should have 
a good indication of what aspects of the SFM system and its objectives are vulnerable 
to climate change. If vulnerabilities exist, it is now time to identify adaptation options 
(chapter 5) and put those options into practice (chapter 6). Conversely, if the SFM system 
is sound and no vulnerabilities have been identified, you should continue to monitor the 
system and reassess vulnerability as new knowledge, learning, or insights are gained (see 
figure 4 in Williamson et al. [2012]). Use Worksheet 4.5 (Decision point: Is adaptation 
required?) to record your determination of whether adaptation is required on the basis of 
the vulnerability assessment.
