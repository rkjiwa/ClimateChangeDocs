Inability to predict future impacts with confidence can be a significant barrier to 
vulnerability and adaptation assessment. An alternative approach is to develop a number 
of plausible scenarios (e.g., “this is what might happen”) describing a range of possible 
futures and to use these scenarios as a foundation to guide the exploration of climate 
change impacts and the implications of adaptation decisions (see “Case study – Forest 
Futures project”). 

Scenarios Defined 
The creation of scenarios is a well-developed technique for planning under uncertainty 
(see sidebar The Power of Scenarios in Climate Change Adaptation). A scenario is 
not a single prediction or forecast, which would imply that a particular outcome is likely 
to occur. Rather, a scenario represents one of any number of possible futures. As such, 
scenarios are constructed stories about conditions that could occur in the future. It is 
essential that scenarios be logical, internally consistent, and believable portrayals of 
possible future conditions. 

Berkhout et al. (2002) described approaches for scenario development in the context of 
climate change assessment with four underlying principles for scenario analysis: 

 

 

 

 

(1) 

 recognizing that past trends do not provide a basis for projecting the future

(2) 

(3) 

(4) 

 accepting that the future cannot be predicted with certainty but that “exploring” 
possible futures can inform decision making

 accepting uncertainty and recognizing that any one of a number of different 
futures could occur 

 acknowledging that local knowledge is fundamentally important for successful 
scenario development.

The Power of 
Scenarios in Climate 
Change Adaptation

By illustrating possible future 
settings, scenarios can be 
used as a tool for long-
term planning and decision 
making in the present. They 
shift the analytical focus 
away from estimating the 
most likely path, which is 
unknown in a changing 
climate, toward determining 
the range of consequences 
of potential changes and 
the most appropriate 
adaptations across these 
different situations (i.e., robust 
adaptation options). For 
this reason, Berkhout et al. 
(2002) referred to scenarios 
as “learning machines.” A 
scenario does not imply 
“This is what will happen, 
and this is what you should 
do about it.” Rather, a set of 
well-constructed scenarios 
indicate “This is what could 
happen in the future” and ask 
the question “What would  
you do about it now if this 
were to happen?”

Case Study – Forest 
Futures project 

A recent example of an exercise involving integrated scenario development in forestry is the 
Forest Futures project completed by the Sustainable Forest Management Network, led by Dr. Peter 
Duinker (Dalhousie University). The Forest Futures project used a structured process to develop 
scenarios for “plausible” futures across a range of uncertain conditions, including climate change, 
and to explore the implications of those scenarios for the many benefits that Canadians derive 
from forested lands. 

Central to the project were a series of national and regional workshops used to identify the 
drivers of future change, to define plausible scenarios, and to analyze those futures from various 
perspectives. The process was designed to involve a large number of people from many forest 
stakeholder groups and to integrate their expertise and insight into the project’s outcomes. 

The overall objective of the Forest Futures project was to produce a set of documents that inform 
the scenarios and analyses, which can in turn be used to inform decision making by industry, 
governments, and other groups interested in Canadian forests. 

The products of the Forest Futures project—scenario descriptions, research papers describing 
drivers, workshop proceedings, and analysis documents—are available online at:
