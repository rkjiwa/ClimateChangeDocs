1.1 Escalating Costs of Natural Disasters in Canada

According to Public Safety Canada, the number of  
natural disasters for which provinces and territories 
required and obtained federal assistance under the 
Disaster Financial Assistance Arrangements (DFAA) 
increased nearly tenfold between 2005 and 2014, 
compared to the previous decade. Over this 10-year 
period, the total loss from floods amounted to just over 
$12.5 billion, the largest expense for the DFAA. Going 
forward, the annual costs of  the DFAA program are 
expected to average $902 million, with $673 million 
attributable to flood events. This substantially exceeds 
the $100 million nominal program budget (Figure 1).vi
