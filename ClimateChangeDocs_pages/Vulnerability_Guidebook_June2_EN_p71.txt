CHAPTER 6     IMPLEMENTATION AND   

MAINSTREAMING OF ADAPTATION

Before you begin:
It is recommended that you read 
the report Adapting sustainable 
forest management to climate 
change: a review of assisted tree 
migration and its potential role 
in adapting sustainable forest 
management to climate change 
by Ste-Marie (2014). It explores 
the various ecological, social, and 
technological facets to consider 
when implementing assisted 
migration as an adaption option, 
and more generally serves as an 
example of factors to consider 
before implementing any 
adaptation option for SFM.
