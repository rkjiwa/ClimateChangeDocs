Delta’s visualization of climate change impacts80,81
Delta, British Columbia (population 99 863), is 17 kilometres south of Vancouver, at the mouth of the Fraser River. 
The low-lying community is at risk of flooding from sea level rise and increased intensity and frequency of storm 
surges.82 Since 2005, Delta has partnered with the Collaborative for Advanced Landscape Planning (CALP) at 
the University of British Columbia (UBC) to develop visualizations of the flooding risk to Delta. CALP and UBC’s 
Okanagan campus developed a 3D virtual environment where Delta residents could see what adaptation actions 
would look like. For example, the following image shows a typical residential street inundated by flood waters 
following a major storm surge event. Delta officials found the visualization process useful in engaging local 
residents. Since the public consultations in 2007, Delta has integrated adaptation into various infrastructure and 
operational decisions.
