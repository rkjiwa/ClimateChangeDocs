6. Consult with your local planning authority and provincial officials. Remember that the proposed 
work must comply with all applicable building code, fire code, by-law and building permit requirements. 
Some  planning  authorities  may  prohibit  construction  within  a  flood  hazard  area.  In  addition,  any 
applicable  provincial  permits  must  be  obtained.  For  example  a  Watercourse  and  Wetland  Alteration 
Permit is required prior to fill placement or other activities such as construction, demolition, clearing land, 
landscaping,  etc.,  within  30  metres  (100  feet)  of  a  wetland  or  watercourse.    Those  considering 
construction in coastal areas should also consult New Brunswick’s Coastal Areas Protection Policy. 
 
7. Select an appropriate method of floodproofing. Always seek expert advice about the best way to 
floodproof your home because improper floodproofing selection and design can put people and property 
at risk. 
 
8.  Plan  your  floodproofing  project  and  hire  experts  to  do  the work.  Use  a  licensed,  bonded,  and 
insured contractor. Before hiring a contractor, be sure to check references. 
 
9. Know the extent of the remaining flood risk, because it can’t be eliminated entirely.
