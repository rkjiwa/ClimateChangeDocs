Figure 3: Road infrastructure in the Prairies.

There is significant trucking activity in the Prairies; much of this supports an extensive agricultural 
export market. Key road-freight border crossings in the Prairies include Emerson (Manitoba), Coutts 
(Alberta), and North Portal (Saskatchewan). These crossings collectively accounted for 12 percent 
of Canada’s road trade with the United States in 2014, 9.2 percent of exports, and 14.2 percent of 
imports (Transport Canada, 2015).

2.1.1 WINTER ROADS

Winter roads (Figure 3) constitute an important part of the northern Prairies’ road network, providing 
seasonal access to remote communities and reducing the tonnage of goods requiring more 
expensive air delivery. Winter roads enable the delivery of food, fuel, medical supplies, and building 
materials (reducing the costs of these goods); support local economies; and provide access to 
healthcare and other parts of the region. 

Manitoba’s winter roads typically operate from mid-January to mid-March, extend approximately 
2,500 km, and serve 28 communities with a total population of 30,000 (Taylor and Perry, 2014). 
Comparably, winter roads in Alberta and Saskatchewan (with similar operating seasons) are modest: 
Alberta operates two routes totaling 447 km, while Saskatchewan’s three winter roads cover 274 km 
(Federal/Provincial/Territorial Sub-working Group on Northern Transportation, 2015). There is significant 
concern that warmer winters associated with changing climate conditions will result in shorter 
operational seasons for freight operators; however, as discussed in Section 4.5 and Case study 3, 
recent years have witnessed longer seasons (Sauchyn and Kulshreshtha, 2008).
