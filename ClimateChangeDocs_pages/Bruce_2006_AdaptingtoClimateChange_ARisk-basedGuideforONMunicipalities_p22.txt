 

measures such as numerical values 
may be used so long as they do not 
imply an accuracy that is not implicit in 
the comparative values.    

(cid:131)  Because experts and non-experts 
generally view risks differently, it is 
important to maintain an open and 
interactive dialogue with stakeholders in 
order to accurately gauge their level of 
acceptance of risks.

(5)  During the dialogue with stakeholders about 
their perceptions and the acceptability of the 
risks, begin to identify plausible risk control 
options to help reduce unacceptable risks to 

 

19

acceptable levels.  These will be considered 
in the next step. 

(6)  Update the risk information library  
Expected results and outputs 
•  Risks evaluated in terms of probability, 

consequence, costs and benefits. 

•  Risks prioritized. 
•  Unacceptable risks identified. 
•  Meaningful dialogue with stakeholders about 

acceptability of risks. 

•  Risk information library updated. 
Decision 
•  End the process if: 

(cid:131)  Stakeholders agree that the risks are 

acceptable; or  

(cid:131)  The risk is completely unacceptable 

cannot be reasonably dealt with, and all 
stakeholders agree that the process 
should be ended.  This would only 
happen if the risk or activity generating it 
was not mandatory or inevitable. 

•  Go back if: 

(cid:131)  There is insufficient data or information 

to make a decision; 

(cid:131)  Stakeholders were not adequately 

consulted; 

(cid:131)  Not all key stakeholders agree with the 

conclusions; or  

(cid:131)  There is new information that might 
materially change the frequency or 
consequence estimates. 

•  Proceed to the Next Step if stakeholders 
agree that the risks are unacceptable and 
that risk control measures will have to be 
implemented 

Checklist 
Risk evaluation 
 
 

1.  Are the risk evaluation and ranking 

2.  Are all of the major considerations 

completed?   

accounted for? 

3.  Have you consulted with all key 

stakeholders on the acceptability of risks? 
4.  Have you given preliminary consideration 

to controls for unacceptable risks? 
Is the risk information library updated? 

5.
