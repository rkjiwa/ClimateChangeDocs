Climate Change Impacts on Coastal Land Use Management 
This  section  is  a  summary  of  more  detailed  information  provided  in  the  companion  Policy 
Discussion  Paper  20101,  and  provides  a  background  for  management  of  land  use,  building 
elevations and related planning and approvals processes in areas that are at risk of flooding from 
the sea. 

Incremental Sea Level Rise 
Sea Level Rise is predicted to be moderate in the period from 2010 to 2025. However, the rate is 
predicted to increase more quickly in the period leading up to 2100, and then continue to increase 
steadily.  For the purpose of this document the current definition of the expected Sea Level Rise is 
provided  in  Figure  3-1.    The  basis  for  this  definition  is  provided  in  the  policy  document:  Policy 
Discussion Paper 20101. 
 

 

 

Figure 3-1: Projections of Global Sea Level Rise 

 

Figure 3-1 illustrates the range of uncertainty in projections, showing a median projection, as well 
as a range in projections from low to high. The uncertainty increases into the future. To protect the 
large  investment  that  buildings  involve,  and  respecting  current  trends  in  SLR,  a  precautionary 
principle is followed to create the Recommended Curve for Sea Level Rise Policy in BC.  As new 
SLR  predictions  become  available  with more  accuracy,  allowances  for  SLR  in  coastal  BC  areas 
may be adjusted, up or down, reflected in a change to these guidelines in the future. 
The  combination  of  certain  sea  level  change  -  but  at  an  uncertain  rate  into  the  future  -  creates 
complexity for the determination of Designated Flood Level (DFL) and related Flood Construction 
Level (FCL).
