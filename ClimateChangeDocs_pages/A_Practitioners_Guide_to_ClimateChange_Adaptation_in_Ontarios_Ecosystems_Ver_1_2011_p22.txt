Within the study area, it is important to identify environmental themes that are pertinent to the assessment. Availability and quality of 
data and availability of expertise should be considered in selecting themes. Examples of themes include:  

 

 

 

 Hydrology;  

 Fish and aquatic habitat; 

 Wildlife; 

 Forests;  

 Wetlands 

 Invasive species; 

 Species at risk; and 

 Parks and protected areas.

There are many potential indicators associated with each theme that can be used to focus the assessment. Within the aquatic habitat 
theme for example, potential indicators include distribution of coldwater fish species in streams, or temperature and oxygen regimes 
in lakes and their associated habitat availability for fish species. Similarly, changes in bird species distribution could be an indicator 
within a wetland or forest theme.  

Another  approach  involves  a  biodiversity-focussed  analysis  that  assesses  the  vulnerability  of  various  ecosystem  services  to  a 
changing climate (Patt et al., 2009). Ecosystems provide food and fresh water, climate and disease regulation, cultural services such 
as  recreational  opportunities,  and  nutrient  cycling  and  soil  formation  among  other  services  (Millennium  Ecosystem  Assessment, 
2005). All of these services are potentially vulnerable to climate change.
