 

stakeholders demand higher levels of safety, 
and may refuse to accept any risk at all. 
The development of trust between stakeholder 
and decision-maker is only one of the benefits of 
an effective communication process. 
Stakeholders are often the source of information 
critical to the decision-process.   

For example, during a prolonged 
extreme heat episode, a municipality 
issued instructions through the Chief of 
Police that people who were suffering 
heat stress effects should report to the 
local militia armouries for help.  Very few 
people showed up even though there 
was a lot of evidence to suggest that 
many citizens were suffering.   

The Mayor had a new announcement 
put out through the cityâ€™s Medical Officer 
of Health for people with heat stress to 
come to the local high school for help.  
Most responded positively to this 
announcement.  

The communication process is necessary so 
that information may be passed effectively from 
the risk management team to stakeholders. The 
same process is used to evaluate stakeholder 
acceptance of risk.  Sometimes stakeholders 
just want to be involved in the decision process 
so that they can monitor the performance of the 
decision-maker and to see what is going on. 
Again, by involving stakeholders "who just want 
to watch" provides the decision-maker with the 
opportunity to build trust with these 
stakeholders.
