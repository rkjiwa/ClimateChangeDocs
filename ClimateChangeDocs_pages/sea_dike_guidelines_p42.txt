Richmond – Sturgeon Bank Sea Dike 

1.3.1  Location 

The Richmond-Sturgeon Bank Sea Dike is located on the shoreline of West Richmond and protects 
the City of Richmond from inundation by storm surge and associated wave effects from the Strait of 
Georgia, Figure 1-8. The sea dike is one part of the dike system that surrounds Richmond. 
The dike is directly exposed to sea level rise, storm surges and only indirectly to the wave climate 
in the Strait of Georgia as some protection is provided by the extensive inter-tidal flats of Sturgeon 
Bank, by the jetties located on the main and north arms of the Fraser River and by the Iona jetty.  
This site is most exposed to severe NW winds that follow in the wake of severe storm systems; 
however at  a  detailed  stage  of  evaluation,  consideration  about  the  present  and  future  degree  of 
protection against SE and S winds provided by the Steveston Jetty will be required. 
The seaward slope of the existing dike consists of a grass covered 1:5 slope with a steep grass 
covered landside slope leading to a drainage channel, Figure 1-9 and Figure 1-10.  The existing 
dike cross-section in the vicinity of this example is shown in Figure 1-11. 
Land-use immediately behind the dike consists mainly of residential and recreational (golf course) 
land  uses,  Figure 1-12.  Some  areas  of  the  adjacent  lands have  recently  been  redeveloped  to  a 
higher density than the historical single-family housing,  
Land elevations in the area are reported to be subsiding at a rate of approximately 1-2 mm/year. 
The net expected (including land subsidence) regional sea level rise by 2100 for this area is 1.2 m.
