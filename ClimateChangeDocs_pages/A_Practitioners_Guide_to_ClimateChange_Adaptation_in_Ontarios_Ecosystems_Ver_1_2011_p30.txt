 

 

To  assess  adaptive  capacity,  look  at  ecological  adaptive  capacity  (e.g.,  plasticity,  or  how  changes  in  temperature  cause  different 
genes to be expressed in tree species, dispersal abilities, etc.) and/or human adaptive capacity (e.g., the ability to implement planned 
adaptation measures to cope with changes as a result of economic resources, institutional capacity, infrastructure, technology, etc.).  

For each indicator, rank the current adaptive capacity of the system as High (H), Medium (M), or Low (L).  

 High – The indicator shows a high tolerance to change and a strong ability to adapt to new conditions or stresses.  

 Moderate – The indicator shows a moderate tolerance to change and some ability to adjust or adapt to new conditions or 

stresses.  

 Low – The indicator shows very little or no tolerance to change and limited ability to adapt to new conditions.
