 

days every 2 weeks and during those three days only exist for 2 to 3 hours (within a range of 
approximately ± 0.1 m) on each of the three days. 
The probability of a high tide window is then approximately: 
3 days x 2 hours/window 
14 days x 24 hours/day  

3 days x 3 hours/window 
14 days x 24 hours/day  

   or between  

1/56 to 1/37 

 
 to 
 

 

 

 

 
As the duration of the peak of a storm surge is typically approximately 6 hours long (within a 
range of ± 0.1 m), or approximately twice the duration of the high tide then the probability of 
having the peak of a storm surge at high tide becomes 2/56 to 2/37 or 1/26 to 1/18.5.  

For the purpose of this report we have taken the probability of a high tide window during the 
occurrence of a storm to be approximately 1/20.  On this basis the total AEP for high tide and 
a typical winter storm (the annual average expected storm) becomes 1/20 x ½ ≈ 1/40.  By the 
same reasoning the estimated AEP for the total water level during the largest storm surge of 
record shown in Figure 2-5, occurring at MWL becomes approximately 1 x 1/300 ≈ 1/300. 
 
The AEP for high tide and a storm with an AEP of 1/200 years (the current guidance AEP) 
becomes 1/20 x 1/200 ≈ 1/4000. 
 
The AEP for a storm that will yield a Designated Flood Level with an AEP of 1/10000 years 
becomes 1/500, which is not significantly greater in actual effect than the current guidance in 
British Columbia.

Joint Occurrence of Storm Surge and Waves 
The selection of a sea dike crest elevation that satisfies the chosen design criteria requires 
the identification of the wave climate that is expected to occur during the Designated Storm.  
Preliminary examination of the joint occurrence of recorded waves and residual water levels 
(storm  surge)  from  two  areas  in  coastal  British  Columbia  waters  suggests  that  the  largest 
waves are not necessarily associated with the largest storm surges, Figure 2-6 and Figure 
2-7. 
For the purpose of this assignment it has been assumed for the sea dike examples, that the 
wave climate present at the sea dike is controlled by the depth of water at the sea dike and 
that  the  wave  climate  in  deep  water  is  sufficient  to  sustain  the  depth  limited  conditions.  
Further  investigations  are  warranted  for  all  areas  of  coastal  British  Columbia  and  will  be 
required during more detailed engineering for sea dikes.
