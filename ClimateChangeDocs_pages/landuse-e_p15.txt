Halifax Regional Municipality development agreements
Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM) (population 390 000) is the most populous urban community in Atlantic 
Canada and the capital of Nova Scotia. Climate change, which is expected to bring more frequent storms to the 
area, will likely increase the vulnerability of coastal development and infrastructure.28 Various community plans, 
including the 2006 HRM Regional Plan, already call for new developments to be constructed a minimum height 
above the ordinary high-water mark.29 
One flexible mechanism that planners in Halifax use to address coastal threats is development agreements. Certain 
areas of the community are designated as zones where review and approval of development projects proceed 
through negotiation. Local bylaws specify in general terms the matters to be considered in such negotiations, 
giving planners latitude to address a broad range of issues regarding environmental protection, natural hazards 
and other concerns.30 The developer may be asked to produce relevant information (such as the impacts of 
wave-run up on a particular property) and to consider and adopt appropriate hazard mitigation strategies. In a 
recent development in downtown Dartmouth (an HRM municipality), local officials and the developer agreed to 
establish minimum elevations for a new marina and other seaside structures that were several metres higher than 
provided in area plans. This was consistent both with the developer’s interest in protecting the property and the 
community’s interest in minimizing risk. The development agreement process enabled planners and developers to 
exchange information on storm surge and wave run up on this site, and to produce a more resilient project design.
