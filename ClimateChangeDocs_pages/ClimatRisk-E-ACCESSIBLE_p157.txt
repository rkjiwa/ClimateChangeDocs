2.1 ROAD TRANSPORTATION

Ontario’s highway system includes over 16,600 km of provincially-managed highways, 2,756 bridges, over 1,800 
km of the TransCanada Highway system, and an extensive regional/municipal road network (Ontario Ministry of 
Northern Development and Mines, 2012). There is an extensive user base for this network, which is presented in 
Figure 3. In 2013, Ontario had over 11 million active road vehicle registrations, including 7.6 million light vehicles 
(e.g., cars, pickup trucks, and vans) and 237,000 heavy vehicles (e.g., buses and tractor-trailers); the rest of this 
figure includes trailers, motorcycles, and farm/construction vehicles (Statistics Canada, 2015a).  

The road system is an essential component of Canada’s international and interprovincial trading network. 
In 2015, trucking accounted for 68.9 percent of the value of Ontario’s trade with the United States (Transport 
Canada, adapted from Statistics Canada, International Trade database). The Ambassador Bridge border 
crossing is especially critical, accounting for 23.3 percent of cross-border truck traffic between Canada and the 
United States in 2015 (Transport Canada, 2016).

Northern and Central Ontario features more than 3,000 km of winter roads, linking remote communities to the 
provincial highway network (Federal/Provincial/Territorial Sub-Working Group on Northern Transportation, 2015). 
Ontario’s winter roads are built and maintained by 29 First Nations communities and the Town of Moosonee, 
with financial and technical assistance from provincial and federal governments. While these roads provide 
only seasonal access (typically from December to March), they are far less costly than constructing all-weather 
roads on Arctic terrain, which has been estimated at USD$85,000 (CAD$111,758) per road-km and USD$64,000-
150,000 (CAD$84,147-197,220)4 per bridge (Prowse et al, 2009; Dore and Burton, 2001).
