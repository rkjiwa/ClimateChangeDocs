What’s next? 
The next step is to move from strategy to action. The 
following milestones include time for consultation on the 
exact regulatory standards to be put in place, time to put the 
appropriate structures in place to implement the system, and 
planning to begin implementation on January 1, 2019.

1.

 Engage on the Strategy: Release strategy for comment
and consultation.

2.

 Proclaim or amend enabling legislation.

As we work toward the overall goal of provincial resiliency and 
reducing global greenhouse gas emissions, we will continue to 
seek input from:

• Emissions-intensive sectors 

• Sectors that may have offsets to offer the market 

• First Nations and Métis peoples 

• Environmental interests 

• Leaders of organized communities

3.

 Release additional documents for consultation.

• Citizens 

Details of how and when contributions to this plan can 
be made will be available at the Saskatchewan Ministry of 
Environment website at saskatchewan.ca/environment

4.

5.

 Refine the plan: Hold consultations to refine the plan and
develop the standards.

 Release regulations and guidance documents: Introduce
resilience measures and regulatory standards.

6. Establish reporting structures.

7. Begin implementation.

In this document, we’ve outlined the province’s strategic 
direction, with the aim of kicking off a new, more 
comprehensive conversation on how Saskatchewan is 
preparing for climate change. Consultations will strengthen 
our ability to apply appropriate and valuable insight so we 
can adopt a plan that fits the needs and characteristics of 
our province.

The Government of Saskatchewan will use existing legislation, 
such as The Management and Reduction of Greenhouse Gases 
Act, to proclaim and/or amend necessary sections to provide 
legislative authority for provincial regulation.
