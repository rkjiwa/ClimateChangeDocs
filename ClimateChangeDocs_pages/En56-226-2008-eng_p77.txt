appendix 3: provincial mechanisms to 
promote local sustainability 

■ BRITISH COLUMBIA

Smart Planning for Communities Initiative: Smart Planning is a process for envisioning and
planning for the long-term well-being of communities. The initiative provides a framework that
helps communities develop the ability to engage in planning processes that incorporate
sustainability principles and to apply integrated decision-making. The key capacity building
components provided through the initiative include a website to link local and First Nations
governments to sustainability planning resources, sustainability facilitators, and an information-
sharing and resource network linking sustainability experts, resources, and communities.

Local Government Act: The Act states that the minister may establish policy guidelines
regarding the process of developing, and content of, official community plans and that the
minister may only do so after consultation with representatives of the Union of British Columbia
Municipalities. The minister may require a municipality to adopt an official community plan
within a specified amount of time and, inversely, a local government may, by bylaw, adopt one or
more official community plan

Smart Growth BC: This non-governmental organization works with community groups,
businesses, developers, planners, municipalities and the public to create more livable
communities in British Columbia. It is focused on nurturing and mobilizing citizen movements
regarding growth and sprawl issues around the province and on providing sound alternative
policy solutions to these issues. The organization’s website provides information on a number of
its projects, which cover such diverse issues as agricultural land reserve protection, affordable
housing, and voter education.
