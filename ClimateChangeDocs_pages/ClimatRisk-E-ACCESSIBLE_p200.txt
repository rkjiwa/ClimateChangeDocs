Some tourist regions such as the Gaspé, the Magdalen Islands, the North Shore and the lower St. 
Lawrence have developed facilities and activities to promote the region and attract visitors. Theme 
routes,7 such as the Route des baleines or the Route des Navigateurs, and national parks that draw on 
their relationship with the river (such as the Saguenay-St. Lawrence Marine Park and the Parc National 
du Bic) are pillars of tourist development in these regions. Loss of access to these parks due to erosion 
of roads bordering the river would affect economic and social development. The same is true for 
the Routes bleues, another theme route, and its related infrastructure, which are also affected by 
changes observed along the St. Lawrence (coastal erosion, decreasing water levels, etc.). 

Finally, some portions of the Quebec road network are highly congested with traffic, especially 
in the two metropolitan areas of Québec City and Montréal (MTQ, 2013a). Reduced speed due 
to congestion increases transit time as well as the cost of road transportation. It also reduces the 
dependability or perceived dependability of the mode of transportation. Traffic congestion combined 
with the projected rise in summer temperatures and increased frequency, duration and intensity of 
heat waves, could also have important implications for road freight management systems in the 
future, particularly concerning new refrigeration requirements, choices of materials for pavement, 
and other factors. (Goodwin, 2004; James and James, 2010).
