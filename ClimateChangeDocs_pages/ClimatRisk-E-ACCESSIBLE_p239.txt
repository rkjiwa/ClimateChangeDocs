Brunswick-Nova Scotia border. Green depicts especially low-lying areas. The Isthmus separates 
the Bay of Fundy to the southwest from the Northumberland Strait (Gulf of St. Lawrence) to the 
northeast. (Source: Applied Geomatics Research Group, Nova Scotia Community College) 

Large freight volumes are also moved by truck in Atlantic Canada. While the majority is destined for 
other Canadian provinces, a significant portion is also shipped to the United States (crossing primarily 
at Woodstock and St. Stephen, New Brunswick (Transport Canada, 2014). Major highways and 
connector roads also link cities, towns, and provinces in Atlantic Canada (see Figure 5). 

St. Johnâ€™s, Newfoundland is the easternmost point of the Trans-Canada Highway and joins continental 
Canada via ferry, while a highway to northern Quebec joins Labrador to the rest of the country. 
Prince Edward Island is linked to New Brunswick via the Confederation Bridge. Completed in 1997, the 
12.9 km stretch is the longest bridge in the world over seasonally ice-covered water (Strait Crossing 
Bridge Ltd., 2015) and facilitates the movement of people and goods between the mainland and 
the island year-round. The Trans-Canada Highway connects New Brunswick to Quebec and areas 
west through the most northwestern point of the province, and to Nova Scotia across the Chignecto 
Isthmus).  Trucking accounts for about $500 million in trade flow annually across the Isthmus (Webster 
et al., 2012; Marlin, 2013).
