In addition, detailed historical climate data can be downloaded and analyzed for individual 
stations across Canada. Graphs of annual mean temperature and precipitation are helpful 
to illustrate local climate variability and trends. Analysis of these data should be conducted 
with the advice of a climate specialist. 

Observations by individuals who have spent a lot of time (e.g., several decades) in your 
SFM area are also valuable for describing changes in local climate conditions or extreme 
weather-related events (see sidebar How important are local observations?). These 
individuals are likely to have observed effects of climate change or extreme weather 
events that may not be obvious from analysis of climate data. Human memory is not 
always reliable, however, so climate data should be sought to corroborate any changes 
that are thought to have created significant ecological, economic, cultural, or social 
impacts. This sharing and linking of local, traditional, and scientific knowledge can foster 
ongoing exchanges, facilitate continuous learning, and provide momentum for effective 
and practical adaptation responses (Gray 2012). 

How Important are Local Observations?

People who work day-to-day in climate-sensitive resource industries (e.g., 
forestry or agriculture) tend to have an intimate understanding of their local 
surroundings and of how the current local climate affects their respective 
management systems. They often understand the local climate and have some 
sense of their vulnerability to climate and climate variability. 

For example, forest managers will likely know when the most recent severe 
fire years occurred and will recall what combination of high-temperature days 
and periods without rainfall contributed to them. When such relationships are 
established, it becomes easier to answer questions such as, What would happen 
if conditions become hotter and drier?  What would happen if the hot and dry 
conditions that contributed to a severe fire year become “normal” conditions at 
some point in the future?

Long-time residents from the SFM area who spend much of their time on the 
land (e.g., hunters, backcountry recreationists, First Nations people) can also 
provide valuable observations of climate and environmental changes. Efforts 
to combine these observations with climate data through events such as 
workshops can often lead to rewarding discussions between local residents, 
forest managers, and researchers.
