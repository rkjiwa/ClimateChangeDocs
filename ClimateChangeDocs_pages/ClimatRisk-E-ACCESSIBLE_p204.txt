Warming temperatures will also bring changes to other indicators that affect the transportation sector. 
For example, the cold season will begin later and end earlier, resulting in a season close to one month 
shorter in the south of the province by 2050 (Logan et al., 2016, in press). Projections of degree-days of 
freezing are shown in Figure 5.

Figure 5: Simulated historical and future conditions of annual freezing degree days calculated from an 
ensemble of climate scenarios (n=11) following RCP 8.5 greenhouse gas forcing trajectory. The historical 
panel represents the median of the 11 climate scenarios9 while future horizons panels represent the 
median (i.e., the median of all available projections) (left), as well as the 10th and 90th percentiles (i.e., 
lower and higher bounds) (top and bottom right) of the climate scenario ensemble.  The 30 year 
regional mean of four large urban centres (Gatineau/Ottawa, Greater Montréal, Sherbrooke and the 
Québec city region) is indicated above the black regional contours. (Source: Ouranos)

Recent observations show a rise in the number of daily freeze-thaw cycles during warmer years 
(Chaumont and Brown, 2010). However, projections for mid-century suggest a decrease in the 
number of freeze-thaw cycles. Indeed, from 2050, it is likely that the cold season will shorten to the 
extent that it will be difficult to reach the same number of freeze-thaw cycles currently observed in a 
given season.

 Note that in this case the historical climate normal values are not calculated from observed data, but instead from simulated 
climate model output which has been corrected to consider observed values using a post-processing method.
