From the assessment 
framework…
“If it is determined that 
adaptation is required, it is then 
necessary to identify options. The 
identification of these options or 
their subsequent modification 
will depend on the types and 
magnitudes of SFM vulnerability 
identified in [chapter] 4. Some 
adaptation options will reduce 
the potential negative impacts 
or increase the potential positive 
impacts, whereas others will 
enhance adaptive capacity 
or reduce adaptive capacity 
deficits.“

—Williamson et al. (2012)

5.1  Overview

This chapter provides guidance on developing climate change adaptation options for 
SFM. It includes two worksheets designed to facilitate this assessment:

Worksheet 5.1.  Develop potential adaptation options for SFM objectives  

Worksheet 5.2.   Develop potential adaptation options for the overall SFM system of 

interest

Purpose of “assessing vulnerability”

Outcomes

To develop a suite of adaptation options 
for the SFM system of interest and to 
assess the importance of each option for 
achieving SFM objectives

•   A list of possible adaptation options for 

each of the CCFM SFM criteria and for 
the overall SFM system of interest or, if 
you are reassessing adaptation options, 
a list of modified adaptation options

•   An assessment of the importance of 
adaptation options for achieving SFM 
objectives and for the overall SFM 
system of interest under the range of 
climate change scenarios that you have 
defined 

5.2  Develop Potential Adaptation Options

5.2.1     The Theory
Once key current and future vulnerabilities have been identified, the next step is to 
formulate a list of adaptation options. There is little theory available on the development 
of adaptation options (see “Case study –Capabilities approach to identifying adaptation 
options” for one approach). The key is to develop as wide a range of options as possible, 
given the scenarios developed earlier in the vulnerability assessment process. The 
adaptation options can focus on a range of policy, practice, or capacity changes. The 
options will be prioritized and the feasibility of implementing them assessed in chapter 6. 

5.2.2     The Practice
An inventory of adaptation options was compiled to aid in the development of this 
guidebook (see Appendix 5). This inventory was based on a review of the literature 
(drawn largely from Ogden and Innes 2007 and Innes et al. 2009) to identify adaptation 
options previously suggested by researchers as ways of incorporating climate change 
considerations into forest management and planning.
