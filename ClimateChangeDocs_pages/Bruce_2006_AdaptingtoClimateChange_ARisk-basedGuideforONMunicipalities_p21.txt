Risk Information Library.  Ensure that all the 
data used to develop the estimations of the 
frequency or probability and consequences or 
impacts are recorded and carefully stored in the 
risk information library.  This data may have to 
be reviewed or updated if the steps are repeated 
in the future and the baseline data will be very 
important in this process.  Also, the rating

STEP 4: Risk Evaluation 
 
Purpose 
•  Develop a process for comparing or ranking 

each risk scenario. 

•  Evaluate the risks by examining them in 
terms of costs, benefits and acceptability, 
considering the needs, issues and concerns 
of stakeholders. 
Identify unacceptable risks and prioritize 
them for risk reduction or control strategies. 

• 

What to do and how to do it? 
To this point in the process, only the hazards 
and risks have been analyzed.  Now the 
operational aspects and costs and benefits that 
accrue in each scenario will be considered.   
 
The  indirect  costs  and  benefits  can  be  extensive,  so  it  is 
 
important to have the relevant expertise to assess them available 
 
to the risk management team.  An example would be the impact 
 
of reduced water availability to a golf course.  Water prices might 
 
rise, making irrigation prohibitively costly.  In the short term, the 
 
golf  course  might  lose  patronage  and  suffer  a  financial  impact.  
Workers  might  lose  jobs.    In  the  longer  term,  the  golf  course 
 
might  have  to  close,  and  the  land  could  be  converted  into 
 
parkland  or  residential  housing.  Any  of  these  outcomes  has 
 
associated economic and social costs and benefits

carefully annotated and stored for future 
reference.   
Ensure also that the stakeholder analysis and 
data bank is updated.

(End of example for Step 3)
 
(1)  Develop the costs and benefits of each risk 
scenario including not only the direct costs 
and benefits but also the important indirect 
ones. 

 (2) Analyze risk perceptions of key 

stakeholders, including those representing 
the general public. 

(3)  Assess the acceptability of risks associated 

with the risk scenarios and potential 
outcomes. 

(4)  Compare the risks using appropriate criteria 

such as a summary of the consequence 
data from the previous step assessing the 
important social, economic and 
environmental consequences using a 
convenient scale ranging from very low to 
extreme along with the frequency or 
probability estimates.   
(cid:131)  Consider using a “risk evaluation matrix” 
to assist in comparing or prioritizing the 
various risks.  Combine the frequency 
and consequence ratings for each risk 
as determined in Step 3 into a single 
matrix.  Establish acceptability values 
against which the various risks can be 
compared.  The chart below is an 
example for such a display. This chart 
uses qualitative measures such as 
“low”, “moderate”, “major”.  Other
