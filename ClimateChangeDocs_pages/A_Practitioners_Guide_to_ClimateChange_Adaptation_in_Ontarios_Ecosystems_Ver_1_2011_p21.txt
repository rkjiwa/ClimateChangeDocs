Worksheet 1.1: Selecting the Study Area  

Brainstorm the options for project areas, recognizing that boundary delineations can be at different spatial scales and will be uniquely 
affected by the issues motivating the study. Study designers should consider data and information availability. Considering the details 
of  future  implementation  can  also  assist  with  the  establishment  of  project  boundaries  (i.e.,  aligning  with  existing  planning  or 
management units to enable the mainstreaming of adaptation into existing plans).
