 F How may climate change affect the community given its particular geography and 

historical development patterns (e.g. heritage buildings, transportation systems, industrial 
areas, topography, geology, hydrology, windward/leeward location, community plan vision 
and goals)?

 F What is the community context within the region (e.g. economic drivers, community 
values, regional services, relations with First Nations) and how will this be taken into 
account when planning for climate change?

 F Where are vulnerable populations and associated services (e.g. hospitals, medical clinics, 
pharmacies, seniors homes, transition houses, group homes, homeless shelters, schools, 
universities, correctional facilities)?

 F What developed areas are likely to be subject to increased risks over time (e.g. due to sea 

level rise, steep slopes or increased flood or wildfire hazards)?

 F What undeveloped areas are likely to be subject to increased risks over time?

 F Where does the OCP indicate new development will be located and should it be re-

evaluated in light of projected climate impacts?

 F Are there potential implications for new or existing development from climate change 

impacts on aquifers (e.g. lower rates of re-charge, salt-water intrusion)?

 F Will an increasing urban heat island effect be a problem?

 F Is there a Tree Management Inventory, Plan or Bylaw? Does there need to be a balance 
between increasing the number of trees for shade and/or removing or pruning trees to 
reduce the risk of wildfire?

 F Are there ecosystems that will require additional protection as a result of climate change? 

Will protected areas and corridors need to be expanded or shifted?

 F Do wetlands need to be protected and expanded (in light of sea level rise and increased 

storm surge)?

 F Are there opportunities to support agriculture and improve food security in the community 

through changes to zoning and other bylaws to protect farmland, promote local food 
production, processing and sales (such as community food gardens, farmers markets, agri-
tourism, etc.)?
