 Overview of the CCFM Framework for  
Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming  
Climate Change into SFM

The CCFM has developed an SFM adaptation approach that can be used by forest 
resource professionals across Canada to identify how best to incorporate climate change 
considerations into their SFM policies, plans, and practices. At the center of the CCFM 
SFM adaptation approach, and the foundation for this guidebook, is a framework for 
identifying sources of vulnerability to climate change that are important to sustainability 
and developing adaptation options to reduce these vulnerabilities. 

The framework, which provides a structured decision-making approach to adapting 
SFM to climate change, is explained in detail in the CCFM report “Adapting Sustainable 
Forest Management to Climate Change: A Framework for Assessing Vulnerability 
and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making” (Williamson et al. 2012). The 
framework outlines the following four stages for adaptation, which in turn encompass six 
components (or steps) (see Figure 0.1): 

 

 

 

 

 Stage 1 – Organizational readiness: The aim of stage 1 is to explore the organization’s 
readiness to undertake an SFM vulnerability and adaptation assessment (see Gray 2012). 
This guidebook assumes that this stage has been completed and that the organization 
is prepared to initiate an SFM vulnerability assessment and potentially to change SFM 
policies and practices if required.

 Stage 2 – Pre-vulnerability analysis: The aim of stage 2 is to develop the context 
of the assessment, describe the current climate and climate–forest relationships, and 
develop future climate and forest impact scenarios.

 Stage 3 – Detailed vulnerability analysis: The aim of stage 3 is to identify where SFM 
is vulnerable to climate change (and therefore where adaptation is needed) and where 
opportunities or positive effects could occur (which could be enhanced by adaptation). 

 Stage 4 – Identify, implement, and monitor adaptation: The aim of stage 4 is to 
evaluate, implement, monitor, and mainstream adaptation measures into SFM decision 
making. 

The adaptation framework is somewhat general in nature and nonprescriptive in terms of 
concrete steps required for adaptation of SFM. This guidebook provides an approach to 
moving the framework from general theory into practice.
