WIND

Changes in patterns of wind relate to temperature and precipitation trends and extremes. One study 
suggests that the intensity of average daily wind speed will increase by 10-30 percent across Canada 
by the late 21st century, compared to baseline conditions in the period from 1955-2009 (Cheng et al., 
2014). However, the extent of these changes remains uncertain. 

LAKE, RIVER, AND SEA ICE

Changing patterns of lake, river, and sea ice pose risks to urban regions next to watercourses 
and oceans. The extent and seasonal duration of inland ice is likely to decrease as winters warm; 
however, shifting patterns of spring break-up pose risks in terms of ice-jam flooding and infrastructure 
management on rivers and lakes (Bush et al., 2014). For example, in spring 2015, this phenomenon 
prompted the emergency evacuation of Perth-Andover, New Brunswick (see Chapter 8) (Canadian 
Press, 2015a).

WATER LEVELS

Both inland and ocean water levels are projected to change significantly in Canada, although 
the direction of change will vary geographically. While most of the Atlantic and Pacific coasts will 
experience sea level rise, much of the northern coast will experience relative sea-level decline due 
to a phenomenon known as “glacial isostatic rebound,” in which land formerly covered by glaciers 
slowly decompresses and rises (Atkinson et al., 2016). While water levels on some inland waterways 
are expected to decline (such as the Great Lakes) as a result of greater evaporation, others will rise, 
at least temporarily (Bush et al., 2014).
