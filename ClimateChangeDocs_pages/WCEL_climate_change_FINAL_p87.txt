that updated flood plain mapping and which regulates all new development in the designated flood 
plain. In a report to council regarding the amendments City staff noted that the mapping would 
likely need to be periodically reviewed and updated.7

As a result of the mountain pine beetle epidemic, Prince George has been working to adapt to the 
impacts of climate change in its forest management and operations for more than a decade. Since 
2006 it has had a Community Forest Agreement with the provincial government, which has allowed 
it to manage areas of forested Crown land within City limits. The City has engaged in fuel treatment 
activities including salvage harvesting and thinning operations to reduce wildfire hazards, and has 
funded these activities through grants from NRCAN and UBCM. Prince George has also developed 
a Community Wildfire Protection Plan that includes measures such as guidelines for new develop-
ments, identifying fire hazard areas and public education.8

While it has been an early leader in climate change adaptation at the local government level, Prince 
George is continuing to develop and implement strategies to address the changing climate.
