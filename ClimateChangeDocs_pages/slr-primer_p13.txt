(2) reduces coastal flood risks to acceptable levels in human settlements; and (3) retreats in a planned and 
efficient way from areas that cannot be protected in a cost-effective manner.17 Adaptation is more than 
the simple implementation of a suitable practice or technology. Sea level rise is a progressive and dynamic 
process and continuous adaptation is required. Adaptation should be viewed by community decision 
makers as an ongoing process whereby risks and opportunities are prioritized, risk reduction measures are 
implemented and their effectiveness is tracked and assessed.

Coastal Sensitivity
Natural Resources Canada has mapped the sensitivity of Canada’s coastlines to a rise in sea level. 
Sensitivity here means the degree to which a coastline may experience physical changes such as 
flooding, erosion, beach migration and coastal dune destabilization. The sensitivity index is a product 
of seven variables: relief (topography), geology, coastal landform, sea level tendency, shoreline 
displacement, tidal range and wave height. 

Approximately 7,000 kilometres of coastline are considered sensitive to sea level rise.18 Most of the British 
Columbia coast has a low sensitivity, mainly due to relief, geology and coastal landforms. However, 
the areas at greatest risk are home to significant concentrations of population, built infrastructure and 
economic activity. Major areas of Atlantic Canada (in particular the coasts of Nova Scotia, Prince Edward 
Island and New Brunswick) are considered to have a high sensitivity to sea level rise. In addition, small  
areas of high sensitivity occur locally in B.C., Quebec, and Newfoundland and Labrador.
