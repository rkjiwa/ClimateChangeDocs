Figure 12a: Flooding extent/depth in Halifax Harbour associated with a 10-year return level event 
and a 0.57 m rise in global sea level (highly plausible).  For these projections, it is assumed that 
frequency and intensity of storms remains unchanged in future. (Source: Forbes et al., 2009)

Figure 12b: Flooding extent/depth in Halifax Harbour associated with a 50-year return level event 
and a 1.3 m rise in global sea level (lower probability).  For these projections, it is assumed that 
frequency and intensity of storms remains unchanged in future. (Source: Forbes et al., 2009)
