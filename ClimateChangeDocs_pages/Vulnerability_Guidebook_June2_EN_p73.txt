The main consideration throughout the prioritization and recommendation stages is 
whether the adaptation helps in achieving SFM objectives across a range of potential 
futures.

Lim and Spanger-Siegfried (2005) identified four main methods for prioritizing adaptation 
options:

1.   Cost–benefit analysis – This method uses one criterion—economic efficiency—to 
assess and provide an absolute measure of the desirability of alternative adaptation 
options. It can identify optimal options and priorities, albeit based on a single criterion. 
Cost–benefit analysis has relatively heavy data requirements.

2.   Multicriteria analysis – This method is suitable when more criteria are thought to be 
relevant and it is not possible to quantify and evaluate the criteria in monetary terms. It 
is typically used to rank options. If a “do-nothing option” is one of the alternatives being 
evaluated, a multicriteria analysis can help to clarify whether the adaptation measure is 
better than the status quo.  Subjective judgment plays an important role in multicriteria 
analysis, making its outcomes more arbitrary than those of cost–benefit analysis. 

3.   Cost-effectiveness analysis –This method is a form of economic analysis that compares 

the relative costs and outcomes (effects) of two or more courses of action. It is distinct 
from cost–benefit analysis, in that it does not assign a monetary value to the measure 
of effect. Cost-effectiveness analysis lies somewhere between cost–benefit analysis 
and multicriteria analysis in terms of subjectivity; it is similar to multicriteria analysis in 
providing only a ranking.

4.   Expert judgment – Expert judgments have been used to forecast and assess 

probabilities and risks and have provided useful insights for decision makers, particularly 
in situations characterized by complexity and deep uncertainty and where limited 
information is available. See box Informed Judgments in chapter 5 for a more detailed 
discussion of this approach. 

Once the prioritization step is complete, the priority adaptation options should be 
assessed for ecological and social suitability and for feasibility of implementation. If the 
options are deemed suitable and feasible, the adaptations are “upgraded” from options 
to recommendations. Ste-Marie (2014) has summarized the facets to consider when 
assessing assisted migration as an adaptation option, but the points presented in that 
summary are relevant to any adaptation options being considered. 

6.2.2     The Practice
Few forest management adaptation planning processes have reached the stage of 
prioritizing adaptation options, so limited guidance is available as to what will work in 
various contexts. One recent experience, the Lake Simcoe Vulnerability Assessment, is 
described in the case study below. 

Case Study – Lake Simcoe

The vulnerability assessment for Lake Simcoe, Ontario, involved a Policy Delphi process to 
both elicit a wide range of adaptation options and to assess and refine the list of potential 
options. The original list developed during the assessment process presented over 900 
potential adaptation options. Use of the Delphi process allowed participants to reduce 
the number of options to a more feasible number (see http://www.climateontario.ca/
LakeSimcoeDelphi.php).
