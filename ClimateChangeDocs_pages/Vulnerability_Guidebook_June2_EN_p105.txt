7.3  Worksheets for Chapter 3

The following worksheets provide guidance on developing and describing future climate 
and forest impact scenarios. The worksheets are presented as tables, but it may also be 
useful to describe the climate and forest impact scenarios in narrative form.

Worksheet 3.1  Develop and describe future climate scenarios
 

Table 3.1  Description of future forest impact scenarios

Worksheet 3.2  Develop and describe forest impact scenarios
 

Table 3.2  Forest impact scenarios and overall forest impact ranking

Worksheet 3.1.   Develop and describe future climate scenarios  

Climate baseline – The baseline climate normals recorded in Worksheet 2.1 (Describe 
climatic conditions and trends) will be used as a point of reference. For many of the 
available climate projections, the baseline period is often taken as 1961–1990 or 1971–
2000. 

Climate scenarios – Once you have selected your climate scenarios, complete Table 
3.1, below. This table presents a suggested list of climate and climate-related factors. You 
should adjust the list to include other factors that are relevant to your SFM system of 
interest.

Scenarios can be developed in a number of ways. For example, the overall timeframe 
for the scenarios may be 2014–2100 with scenarios 1–3 representing segments of time 
within this period (e.g., 2014–2040, 2041–2070, 2071–2100). Alternatively, you may wish to 
look at three or more scenarios of various degrees of climate change (e.g., low, medium, 
high) within a certain time frame (e.g., 2041–2070). Ideally, you should examine a range of 
scenarios spanning minimal to extensive climate change. 

You may need to use multiple copies of these worksheets to develop a full range of 
scenarios, and you may also want to include detailed descriptions (e.g., narratives) of the 
scenarios in addition to completing the tabular worksheet.

A web application to generate various climate estimates for specific locations  
of interest anywhere in Canada or the United States is available at
