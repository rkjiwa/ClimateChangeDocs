The !rst step is to carefully remove any loose snow that covers the 
ice. Once the ice is exposed, you can take advantage of the sloped
roof by trying to make drainage paths so that the ice can melt and run
off the roof.
왘 Electric Heating Cables offer the easiest approach to removing ice.
Installing heating cables can be dif!cult depending on the design of
your roof. It is often advisable to call a professional contractor with
experience in installing heating cables for advice. 

왘 Chemical de-icers can also be used to improve drainage. The

easiest approach is to make a hole in the ice approximately every
three feet that exposes the roof surface. De-icer can be placed in
each hole and then in a line towards the edge of the roof. 

Manual ice-removal should be a last-resort option for homeowners.
This process is extremely dangerous and should be done by a professional.

Ice dams
Ice dams represent one of the most common sources of roof damage
for Canadians. An ice dam is a ridge of ice that develops at the edge
of your roof or around drains that prevents snow or water from
melting off your roof. Heat escaping from the interior of your house in

Ice dams form when heat escapes from your attic 
or the interior of your home and melts snow on 
your roof.

combination with poor attic air circulation is the primary cause of ice
dams. As snow hits your roof it can melt in the areas where heat is
escaping. Water will run down the roof towards the edges where it
can come in contact with the colder eave and freeze. As the ice forms,
water trying to drain down the roof will build up behind the “dam”
