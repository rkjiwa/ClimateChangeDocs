About the Institute
for Catastrophic Loss Reduction

The Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction (ICLR), established in
1997, is a world-class centre for multidisciplinary disaster prevention
research and communication. ICLR is an independent, not-for-pro!t
research institute founded by the insurance industry and af!liated with
the University of Western Ontario.

The Institute’s mission is to reduce the loss of life and property caused
by severe weather and earthquakes through the identi!cation and
support of sustained actions that improve society’s capacity to adapt
to, anticipate, mitigate, withstand and recover from natural disasters.

ICLR’s mandate is to confront the alarming increase in disaster losses
caused by natural disasters and to work to reduce disaster deaths,
injuries and property damage. Disaster damage has been doubling
every !ve to seven years since the 1960s, an alarming trend. 

The greatest tragedy is that many disaster losses are preventable. 
ICLR is committed to the development and communication of disaster
prevention knowledge. This document identi!es the steps you can take
to better protect your home from wild!res.
