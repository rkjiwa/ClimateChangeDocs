Case Study – Southwest 
Yukon

implement across a wide range of possible future scenarios. Also identify any options that 
could enhance flexibility in policies and practices given an uncertain future. These could 
also be considered important options.

“Not-important” adaptation options – Some options may not be ranked as important 
for achieving SFM objectives under a changing climate. Although you may not wish to 
consider these options for the remaining assessment steps, it is wise to keep them on 
your list of potential adaptation options for use as a starting point for future reassessment 
of vulnerability. In addition, although these options may not be ranked as important 
for addressing climate change, they may represent important views and opinions of 
interested parties that can be addressed through other planning processes.

A good starting point for climate change adaptation in the forest sector is to proactively 
identify policies and practices with a higher likelihood of achieving management 
objectives across a wide range of potential climate futures. This step should be followed by 
implementation of these options and monitoring of their success in achieving objectives 
within an adaptive management context.

A study in southwest Yukon identified locally appropriate adaptation options by tapping 
into the experiential knowledge base of local forest practitioners while concurrently building 
capacity within this community to implement the options. Thirty forest practitioners 
involved with implementation of a regional forest management plan were engaged in 
identifying climate change vulnerabilities and evaluating alternative adaptation options. 
A structured decision-making approach was used to frame the assessment. Practitioners 
identified 24 adaptation options that they considered important to implement for achieving 
the regional goals and objectives of SFM in light of climate change.

Strategic considerations  

Evaluate adaptation options using best available information (studies, expert judgment, 
datasets, model outputs, etc.). Instead of seeking consensus on a single ranking, you may 
wish to provide a range of rankings from various sources.  

Gather a diverse group, including planners, individuals responsible for implementing 
adaptation actions, representatives of interest groups, and policy makers, to evaluate the list of 
adaptation options.

Given that every forest area has its own unique combination of ecological, economic, social, 
and cultural conditions, there is no single right approach to adaptation. Instead, options 
should be evaluated for specific areas and timeframes, to determine when and where 
various adaptation options should be implemented.

Don’t become overwhelmed by a lack of data or by low confidence in the information 
available for many of these decisions. Use the information that is available, but also plan to 
rely on expert judgments and/or the informed judgments of local forest practitioners (see 
sidebar Informed judgements). Do your best to identify “important” adaptations that are 
likely to do reasonably well over a wide range of potential future conditions.
