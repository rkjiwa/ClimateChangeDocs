Climate Change Adaptation Plan  2012 

 
The City of Windsor was one of a few communities that were selected for analysis of extreme 
temperature.  The temperature projections were completed by the Canadian Regional Climate Model 
(CRCM) developed by the Ouranos Consortium on Regional Climatology and Adaptation to Climate 
Change (Figures 5 and 6). The conclusions of the analysis predict that the number of days over 30oC/86°F 
in Windsor could almost quadruple by 2071–2100 over that experienced prior to 2000.  The number of 
warm nights (over 22oC/72°F) is expected to increase even more dramatically—a tenfold increase by 
2071–2100.viii
