Confidence and Uncertainty

Uncertainties have always been a factor in forest management decisions in Canada, in part because of the long 
lifespan of the country’s common tree species. The pace and scale of climate change simply increases the scope and 
implications of these uncertainties. 

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (Parry et al. 2007) defined uncertainty as “an expression of the 
degree to which a value (e.g., the future state of the climate system) is unknown.” Uncertainty can result from lack of 
information or from disagreement about what is known or even knowable. Uncertainty is a reality in vulnerability 
assessments, given that no one knows exactly how the climate may change or how ecological, infrastructure, or 
human systems will respond to change in a particular location (Glick et al. 2011).

Vulnerability assessments aim to understand and manage, rather than overcome, as much of the full range of 
uncertainty related to climate change as is practicable. At the end of the assessment, uncertainty may appear 
to have expanded, but this impression may relate largely to a better understanding of the underlying factors 
(Parry et al. 2007). In the case of vulnerability assessment of SFM, it is likely that the nature of the SFM system—its 
components and the types of interactions among them—will be better understood. 

Explicitly characterizing the level of confidence in a specific information source and in assessment outcomes 
clarifies where uncertainties are greatest.  However, when it comes to future climate change scenarios, remember 
that “all models are wrong” and that the “outlier” may be the most accurate.

Despite uncertainties about the timing and magnitude of climate change, several authors (Lemmen et al. 2008; 
Glick et al. 2011; Peterson et al. 2011) have concluded that sufficient information exists to begin to adapt—we 
need not be paralyzed by lingering uncertainties. Opportunity now exists to explore these uncertainties in a 
structured manner, such as suggested within this guidebook, and to proactively mainstream adaptation into forest 
management plans, practices, and institutions. 

For more information on uncertainty and vulnerability assessment, see chapter V, “Addressing uncertainty in 
vulnerability assessments,” in Glick et al. (2011). 

Worksheet 3.1  (Develop and describe future climate scenarios) provides a template 
for describing important climate conditions for three scenarios. You might select more 
scenarios, but as a general rule the analysis should have a minimum of three scenarios, 
one of which might be current climate (as a “status quo” scenario). 

It is suggested that scenarios be described by simple names, such as low, moderate, 
and high change to represent an exploration of differences in the rate of change (e.g., 
the change in mean annual temperature). You may choose to explore differences in 
combinations of temperature and precipitation change (such as warmer and wetter, 
warmer and drier) or combinations reflecting different rates of change in temperature and 
precipitation (such as faster warming over time; slower warming over time).
