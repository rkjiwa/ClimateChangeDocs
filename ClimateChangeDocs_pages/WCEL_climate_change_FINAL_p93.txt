Regional and provincial context

 F Are there any existing or proposed provincial guidelines that require consideration 
of climate change impacts relevant to the community? (For example, Ministry of the 
Environment, Climate Change Adaptation Guidelines for Sea Dikes and Coastal Flood Hazard 
Land Use. www.env.gov.bc.ca/wsd/public_safety/flood/structural.html)

 F Have adaptation strategies of other local governments in the region been considered? Is 

the regional board advocating action? Are municipal councils within the region identifying 
issues or already taking action? What can be learned from them? Are there opportunities to 
work collaboratively?

 F Have opportunities to work with universities and colleges, non-governmental 

organizations, businesses and/or others to develop climate change adaptation strategies 
been explored and pursued?

 F Have roles and responsibilities of local, provincial and federal levels of government with 
respect to assessing and responding to climate change impacts been determined, and 
areas of cooperation identified?

 F Has the relationship of local adaptation action to regional adaptation action been 

considered, and roles and areas of potential cooperation identified? Have opportunities 
to work with First Nations been explored? (See Regional Climate Adaptation Planning 
Alliance, Report on Climate Change and Planning Frameworks for the Intermountain West. 
www.parkcitygreen.org/Files/USDN-Inter-Mountain-West-Report_Final-Aug-2011.aspx)

 F Is there potential to create regional partnerships to obtain climate impacts information 
or seek guidance on developing adaptation plans (e.g, from ICLEI www.iclei.org/index.
php?id=611, Columbia Basin Trust www.cbt.org/Initiatives/Climate_Change/?Adapting_to_
Climate_Change) or other external services)?
