EXTREME PRECIPITATION

There are many documented incidents of heavy precipitation events affecting rail transport in 
Atlantic Canada. For example, on August 31, 2007, heavy rain caused a number of culverts to fail 
along CBNS rail in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, as well as wash-outs along many sections. The track 
was closed for approximately three weeks for repair and replacement, disrupting freight movement 
(Stephen Newson, Province of Nova Scotia, personal communication, 2015). In total, the incident cost 
the railway more than $500,000 (Province of Nova Scotia, 2007a, 2007b).  

In April 2003, culverts beneath a rail line in Ellershouse, Nova Scotia washed out during a large storm 
event (Stephen Newson, Province of Nova Scotia, personal communication, 2015). Similarly a severe 
tropical storm in December 2010 caused significant damage to rail infrastructure near Fredericton, 
New Brunswick, as extreme precipitation washed-out rail bridges and undermined rail beds 
(Environment Canada, 2013c). Future increases in the intensity, duration, and frequency of extreme 
precipitation (Bush et al., 2014) would result in even more severe impacts.

Heavy snow also disrupts rail movements in Atlantic Canada. For instance, snowstorms in Nova Scotia 
during winter 2015 delayed the movement of goods and services by rail from multimodal facilities to 
North American markets, proving costly for operators (Henderson, 2015; Cuthbertson, 2015). Heavy 
snow will continue to affect rail movements in Atlantic Canada, at least over the short term. 

ICE-JAM FLOODING

Inland flooding associated with snowmelt and ice jams8 have caused major damage to rail systems. 
Floods involving ice jams tend to be more damaging to infrastructure than open-water events, 
particularly to bridges. For example, during a February 1970 flood on the Saint John River, New 
Brunswick, a series of ice jams on six rivers resulted in the destruction of 32 bridges (both road and rail) 
and damage to 124 others (see Figure 10) (Government of New Brunswick, 2012).

  An ice jam is a temporary ice blockage of a river, formed by the accumulation of ice fragments that build up to restrict the 
flow of water. Ice jams form during both the freeze-up and breakup periods, but it is usually breakup jams that have the greater 
flooding potential. Over two thirds of total provincial flood damage costs in the Saint John River basin are due to ice-related 
events (Environment Canada, 2013a).
