This is a model of how the provincial government intends 
to measure the resilience of Saskatchewan to the effects of 
climate change. We look forward to engaging with citizens to 
better refine the indicators we use to measure our resilience. 
At the same time, we hope the adoption and use of this model 
in Saskatchewan will broaden the national conversation about 
climate change, so that all of Canada is better prepared for 

the climatic, economic, and policy changes that we anticipate. 
There may also be some future changes that we cannot yet 
anticipate, and therefore we will need to periodically revisit this 
model to make sure that we continue to adapt our approaches 
as we learn more about the effects of climate change on 
Saskatchewan and the world.
