Climate change is not only associated with warming conditions, but also more extreme weather 
events such as high intensity rainfall (Murdock and Sobie, 2013). The Pacific Climate Impacts 
Consortium preliminary analysis indicates that the frequency of Pineapple Express events will increase 
by 2041-2070 with the largest increases on the coast.  The average number of atmospheric river days 
per year is projected to approximately double at most locations, including the interior.

Projected changes in sea level in British Columbia (Figure 5) are similar to historic patterns (Section 
2.1).  The greatest amounts of sea level rise are projected to occur along the southern mainland and 
southeast Vancouver Island. The least amount of sea level rise is projected in areas where there is 
significant tectonic uplift, a non-climatic influence, described above in Section 2.1.  Projections vary 
according to emissions scenarios, and changes in relative sea level could be negligible at some sites 
under a low emissions scenario.
