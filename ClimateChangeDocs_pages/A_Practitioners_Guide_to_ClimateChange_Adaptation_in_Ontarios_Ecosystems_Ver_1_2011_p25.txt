Worksheet 1.3: Building Your Project Team  

To identify the assessment team and to articulate the expectations and activities of each team member, consider the following: 

 

 

Team roles and responsibilities 

What  is  the  collective role  and  responsibility  of 
the project team (e.g., team mandate)? 

Who  is  the  team  leader?  Who  is  the  outreach 
champion?  What  role  do  other  project  team 
members play? 

Who  are  the  contributors  leading  the  technical 
assessments  and  what  resources/expertise  do 
they have?

Identifying and Engaging Partners and Stakeholders  

Climate  change  adaptation  is  most  effective  when  framed  as  a  participatory,  iterative,  adaptive  management  process  that  builds 
strong  working  relationships  with  partners  and  stakeholders.  When  vulnerability  assessments  are  participatory,  they  can  enhance 
participants’  understanding  of  the  various  actors’  perspectives;  help  to  develop  and  garner  support  for  adaptation  options,  targets, 
and visions; and build capacity to implement results. In some cases, local participation can also help the project team build a strong 
portfolio of local observations that add value to the process, particularly where monitoring data are limited. Local participation may 
also  allow  recognition  of  interacting  factors  and  stimuli  beyond  climate,  including  political,  cultural,  economic,  institutional,  and 
technological factors (Smit and Wandel, 2006). Many of the challenges of adapting to climate change can be managed by fostering 
effective working relationships with stakeholders and communities. Teams are encouraged to identify stakeholders and partners and 
discuss possible models for engagement.
