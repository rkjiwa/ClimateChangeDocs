space to grow and export local expertise and experience with sub-arctic and arctic 
infrastructure construction and repair, particularly for permafrost affected areas; 

  Engaging communities on a range of infrastructure challenges to discuss the sustainability of 

community infrastructure, gather key (climate related and other) information, and 
incorporate the results into infrastructure and other relevant planning processes; and 

 

Integrating climate change considerations into mining infrastructure development, 
maintenance and reclamation – a process which can last for over 100 years – to ensure that 
mines are built with future climate in mind. 

5.1.1  Adaptation Opportunity: Improved Accounting for Long-Term Infrastructure Costs 

Improving the accounting for long-term infrastructure costs related to climate change will 
provide benefits, but not doing so does not create significant risks. There are possible economic 
benefits in the long-term but also some economic costs. However, a better accounting approach 
to infrastructure will not likely result in regrettable outcomes even if the threats to 
infrastructure posed by climate change turn out to be less than anticipated.
