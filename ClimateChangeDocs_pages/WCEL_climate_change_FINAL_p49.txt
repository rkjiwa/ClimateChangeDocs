Local governments facing pest infestations or increased interface fire risks may need to consider 
an approach that includes thinning trees in some areas.

Prince George has an exemption to its tree protection bylaw to address mountain pine 
beetle infested trees. Any applications for the exemption must also address slope stability 
issues. http://princegeorge.ca/environment/urbanforestry/mountainpinebeetlecontrol/

Prince George also has a Wildland/Urban Interface Wildfire Management Strategy that 
has provided the basis for its thinning and pruning activities to reduce interface wildfire 
risk that was exacerbated by mountain pine beetle infestation. http://princegeorge.ca/

The City of North Vancouver had a  
consultant put a value on the services provided 
to the City by its 5,415 trees. It was calculated 
that the benefits from the trees amounted to 
$501,000 per year, which would total $25 million 
over 50 years. The maintenance and replacement 
costs associated with the trees only cost $94,000 
per year. The services provided by the trees 
included energy savings as a result of their 
cooling effect in summer, GHG reductions, air 
quality enhancement, stormwater management, 
and increased liveability and property values.
