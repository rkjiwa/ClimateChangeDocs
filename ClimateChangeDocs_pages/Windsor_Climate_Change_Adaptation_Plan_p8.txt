Climate Change Adaptation Plan  2012 

 
consideration for the benefits of adaptation both from reducing the impacts of climate change as well as 
the improvement to the baseline risk from the current climate, the adaptation option can often lead to 
great cost savingsvi.   

Municipalities  have  a  significant  role  to  play  in  climate  change  adaptation.    Many  of  the  impacts  of 
climate  change  will  directly  affect  the  services  provided  by  the  City  of  Windsor  and  our  agencies, 
including:    wastewater  and  stormwater  management;  transportation;  parks  and  urban  forests;  social 
services; emergency services; public health; and electricity distribution. 

The  actions  taken  today  by  the  City  of  Windsor  will  enhance  community  resilience  to  climate  change 
with the objective to reduce the human and economic costs of climate-related impacts.   

Windsor’s Changing Climate 

Between 1948 and 2008, the average annual temperature in Ontario has increased by up to 1.4 °C, with 
scientists predicting that by 2050, the average annual temperature in Ontario will increase by 2.5 °C to 
3.7 °C from the 1961-1990 baseline average. 

Annual Average Temperature 

The Environment Canada weather station located at Windsor Airport has been monitoring and recording 
weather data since 1941.  Since this time, the average annual temperature has increased by almost 1 °C.
