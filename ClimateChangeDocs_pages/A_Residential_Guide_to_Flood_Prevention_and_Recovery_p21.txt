If you remain in your home
Remember that flooding can affect your safety and possibly 
your health. Take precautions to prevent illness and injury 
before you enter any area that has been flooded. 
Helpful hints:
• Assume that everything touched by floodwaters is 

contaminated. Stay clear unless your skin is covered and  
you are wearing protective clothing such as coveralls,  
rubber boots, gloves and masks.

• Keep children and pets away from flooded areas  

and contaminated items.

• Before entering your home, check for foundation and 
structural damage and make sure all porch roofs and 
overhangs are supported. If you suspect any damage, leave 
your home until a professional such as a building inspector  
or structural engineer has confirmed it is safe to re-enter.

• If you notice any gas odours, evacuate your home and  

contact the gas company or fire department.

• Flood waters can contain sewage (may contain bacteria, 

viruses or parasites), chemicals and debris like broken glass. 
Keep yourself, family and pets away from flood waters.  
Do not enter a flood area unless wearing appropriate  
personal protective equipment and clothing.

• Only if it is safe to do so, turn off electricity in your home  

at the main breaker or fuse box.
