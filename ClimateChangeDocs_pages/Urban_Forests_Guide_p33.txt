 
The City of Victoria has grown ornamental banana trees for many years. In 2010, for the first time, a banana 
tree growing in the greenhouse blossomed and produced fruit, likely due to the previous summer’s heat 
wave. 48 

The City of Victoria also allows the growing of food in city boulevards (with permission). 

Carbon Credits from Forests

Retaining and planting treed areas are important for climate mitigation (by sequestering carbon). However, 
afforestation (land that has been without forest for much longer than land what would be considered 
reforested) is also becoming a source of income to fund climate action (including adaptation programs). 

Consider afforestation projects to capture carbon. In May 2010, the Pacific Carbon Trust issued its first call 
for proposals to buy carbon offsets created as a result of afforestation (planting) projects, providing that 
the carbon sequestration benefits could be verified. Afforestation initiatives need to be over and above that 
needed for ‘normal’ or historic levels of urban forest restocking in order to qualify as a valid offset.49  Carbon 
credits can also be awarded for avoiding deforestation through the retention of trees.

Consider community energy projects which convert waste wood from parks and forests into energy, 
generating revenue and carbon credits. This is part of an Integrated Resource Recovery50  approach to 
waste management.
