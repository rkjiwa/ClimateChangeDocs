GUIDEBOOK FOR ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE  STEP  5

TABLE 5.   EXAMPLES OF ADAPTATION ACTIONS THAT IF DESIGNED CAREFULLY COULD BE TURNED INTO SAM

ACTIONS AND EXAMPLES OF MALADAPTATIONS 

EXAMPLES OF
MALADAPTATIONS

(cid:129) Green space and trees offer a way to cope with hot weather, flooding, and air pollution but are

themselves vulnerable to decreased water availability, rising temperatures, and changing patterns
of disease and pests and can cause damage to the built environment through disruption or
displacement of structures through direct damage as branches fall or through causing soil
shrinkage 

(cid:129) Narrow, tall streets can reduce heat risks during hot summers but can also aggravate winter gloom
(cid:129) Buildings designed to minimise energy use for winter heating may be susceptible to overheating

problems in the summer 

(cid:129) High densities that minimize travel distances and facilitate community energy schemes can also

intensify urban heat island effects, reduce urban drainage capacities, and increase thermal
discomfort and health risks

(cid:129) Flexible, timber-framed construction is effective in managing subsidence risk but may not cope as

well with overheating and flood risks

(cid:129) More heat-tolerant livestock breeds often have lower levels of productivity
(cid:129) Engineering interactions to defend coastlines can change the connectivity of coastal ecosystems,
facilitating the spread of non-native species and warm-temperatures species advancing polewards
(cid:129) Water savings achieved through the implementation of adaptation measures may not be set aside

as buffers against future water supply shortages
Shepherd et al. (2005) found that water use savings and capacity expansions within water
management projects in the Okanagan, BC were used by new residential developments. The
region is now understood to be more at risk from water supply shortages than before the
anticipatory adaptations were implemented.
