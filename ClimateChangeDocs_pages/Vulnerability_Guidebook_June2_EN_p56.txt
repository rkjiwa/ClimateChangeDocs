From the assessment 
framework…
“The first part of assessing the 
vulnerability of SFM to current 
and future climate is to consider 
how the analysis of current 
climate and forest conditions ... 
and the forest impact scenarios 
... might affect each of the SFM 
criteria [and objectives]. The 
impacts on SFM criteria [and 
objectives] should be assessed 
for current climate and for 
each of the future climate and 
forest impact scenarios... The 
second part of assessing SFM 
vulnerability is to determine 
the current adaptive capacity 
of the forest management 
organizations of interest or the 
SFM system.”

—Williamson et al. (2012)

4.1  Overview 

This chapter provides guidance on evaluating and documenting SFM vulnerability to 
current climate (and climate variability) and the range of future climate change scenarios. 
Vulnerability is “the degree to which a system is susceptible to, and unable to cope with, 
adverse effects of climate change, including climate variability and extremes” (Parry et al. 
2007). This chapter is structured around five worksheets that are designed to facilitate a 
detailed assessment of both current and future vulnerability of the SFM system: 

Worksheet 4.1.  Assess current and future impacts on SFM

Worksheet 4.2.  Evaluate adaptive capacity of the SFM system

Worksheet 4.3.  Assess current and future vulnerability

Worksheet 4.4.  Assess overall SFM system vulnerability

Worksheet 4.5.  Decision point: Is adaptation required?

Purpose of “assessing vulnerability”

Outcomes

To evaluate and document vulnerability to 
current climate conditions and a range of 
future forest impact scenarios  

•   Description of the current impacts 

and the range of potential future 
forest impacts on achievement of SFM 
objectives

•   Improved understanding of the degree 

to which the biophysical and human 
elements of your SFM system may 
be susceptible to, or unable to cope 
with, potential future effects of climate 
change 

•   Improved understanding and updated 
list of the uncertainties and knowledge 
gaps related to vulnerability of the SFM 
system to future climate 

4.2 

 Assess Impacts on SFM

4.2.1     The Theory
Impacts on forest conditions and processes due to climate change will likely affect forest 
managers’ abilities to achieve SFM objectives as currently defined (Ogden and Innes 2007). 
Understanding how SFM objectives might be affected by these changes is critical in 
assessing the vulnerability of the objectives to climate change. Therefore, the ability of the 
SFM system to adapt to current and potential climate change impacts should be assessed.
