ESTIMATE FUTURE VULNERABILITY AND RISKS  

 
 
 
 

Step 4 builds on earlier steps during which current vulnerability was assessed and climate scenarios were applied. It combines the 
results of those analyses to develop estimates of future vulnerability.  

Worksheet 4.1: Describing Future Exposure, Sensitivity, and Adaptive Capacity 

Fill out the worksheet with the results of the analyses in Step 3 for each  indicator. Depending on the analytical and methodological 
approach technical experts take in applying future climate scenarios, results describing potential future vulnerabilities will come in a 
variety of forms. With the results, work with technical experts to rank each indicator’s anticipated exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive 
capacity  to  climate  change  as  High  (H),  Medium  (M),  or  Low  (L).  Use  ranking  descriptions  included  in  Step  2.      Descriptions  can 
include specific impacts that may occur. Estimates of future adaptive capacity are not meant to include adaptive assistance that will 
be developed from this process.
