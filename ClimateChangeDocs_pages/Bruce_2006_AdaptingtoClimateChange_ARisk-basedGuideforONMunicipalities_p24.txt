STEP 5: Risk Controls and 
Adaptation Decisions 
 
Purpose 
In the previous step, the risks were evaluated 
and ranked, and a dialogue was held with key 
stakeholders about the acceptability of the risks.  
For unacceptable risks, some consideration was 
given about potential risk control or adaptation 
measure being introduced to bring risks down to 
acceptable levels.  In this step:  
•  Feasible strategies will be identified for 

reducing unacceptable risks to acceptable 
levels.

•  The effectiveness of the adaptation or risk 

control strategies will be evaluated including 
the costs, benefits and risks associated with 
the proposed adaptation measures. 

•  Optimal adaptation or risk control strategies 

will be selected and consideration will be 
given to the acceptability of residual risks. 

What to do and how to do it? 
(1)  Identify feasible adaptation or risk control 

options: 
(cid:131) 

Identify the full complement of potential 
adaptation responses that could reduce 
the frequency or the consequences of 
the risks.  Consider the different types of 
adaptations discussed in the box below
