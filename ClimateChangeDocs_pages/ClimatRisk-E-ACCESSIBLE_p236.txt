Global projections forecast an increasing frequency of extreme heat and decreasing frequency of 
extreme cold in Atlantic Canada (Williams and Daigle, 2011). Extreme precipitation events are also 
likely to become more frequent (Swansburg et al., 2004). Significant changes in wind speeds are not 
anticipated, but there is likely to be a northward shift in storm tracks through the current century, 
increasing storm frequency in Atlantic Canada (Loder et al., 2013).

Sea ice will continue to decrease in extent, thickness, concentration, and duration, with models 
projecting that it will be almost completely absent in the Gulf of St. Lawrence by 2100 (Senneville et 
al., 2013).

In areas of Atlantic Canada currently experiencing sea-level rise, the rate of change will accelerate 
throughout the current century. In areas such as Nain, Labrador, where sea level is currently falling 
due to glacial isostatic rebound, sea level will either continue to fall at a slower rate, or it may start 
to rise, depending on the magnitude of change in global mean sea level (James et al., 2014). 
Projections for Atlantic Canada indicate that under a high-emissions scenario, up to 100 cm of 
sea level rise is possible at some locations by 2100 (Figure 2), and that larger increases cannot be 
precluded (Savard et al., 2016; Atkinson et al., 2016). Global mean sea level will continue to rise for 
centuries after 2100, with the magnitude of future changes influenced by the success of efforts to 
reduce global greenhouse gas emissions (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2013).

Figure 2: Projections of relative sea-level rise for the year 2100 for the median value of the high-
emissions scenario (RCP8.5; after James et al., 2014). See Atkinson et al. (2016) for additional 
information on sea-level projections, and Savard et al. (2016) for additional details on sites in Atlantic 
Canada. (Source: Natural Resources Canada)
