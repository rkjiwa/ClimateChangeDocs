An  example  seawall  dike  cross-section  for  the  year  2100,  as  per  Table  1-3,  is  shown  below  in 
Figure 1-17 where the top of the seawall, not including a freeboard allowance, is designed for an 
overtopping acceptance criteria of 0.4 L/s/m, which is expected to keep any spray loads at or below 
the  capacity  of  the  adjacent  buildings.  This  acceptance  threshold  is  higher  than  might  be 
appropriate  if  untrained  casual  pedestrians  were  expected  to  be  present  during  storms.  The 
example seawall is located on the existing grade slab on Granville Island of approximately +4 m 
CGD.  Foundation considerations have not been addressed in this example.
