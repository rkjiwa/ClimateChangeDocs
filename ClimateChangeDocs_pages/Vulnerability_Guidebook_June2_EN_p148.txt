Ecosystem services
“Ecological services or functions having monetary or non-monetary value to individuals 
or society at large. There are (i) supporting services such as productivity or biodiversity 
maintenance, (ii) provisioning services such as good, fibre, or fish, (iii) regulating services 
such as climate regulation or carbon sequestration, and (iv) cultural services such as 
tourism or spiritual and aesthetic appreciation” (Parry et al. 2007).

Ecozone
“A broad, ecologically distinctive area delineated at a subcontinental level and defined by 
its interaction of human, vegetative, wildlife, climatic, geologic, and physiographic factors. 
Canada’s ecological land classification framework comprises 15 terrestrial ecozones; these 
are subdivided into 53 ecoprovinces, the ecoprovinces into 194 ecoregions, and the 
ecoregions into 1020 ecodistricts” (CCFM 2006).

Exposure
The degree of climate change imposed upon a particular unit of analysis. Exposure may be 
represented as long-term changes in climate conditions, as well as by changes in climate 
variability, including the magnitude and frequency of extreme events (McCarthy et al. 
2001). 

Forest impact scenarios
A range of possible future forest conditions that could result under a given climate 
scenario. Forest impact scenarios include descriptions of changes in (1) processes such 
as physiological processes, phenological processes, and regeneration; (2) the frequency 
and intensity of biotic disturbances, such as insect outbreaks and diseases, and abiotic 
disturbances, such as severe weather, drought, and wildfire; (3) ecosystem health and 
productivity; (4) forest inventory; and (5) forest composition and age-class over the 
landscape.

Mainstreaming adaptation
Inclusion of climate change considerations in day-to-day decision making and 
management on a continuous and ongoing basis.

Resilience
“The ability of a social or ecological system to absorb disturbances while retaining the 
same basic structure and ways of functioning, the capacity for self-organisation, and the 
capacity to adapt to stress and change” (Parry et al. 2007).

Scenarios
“A plausible and often simplified description of how the future may develop, based 
on a coherent and internally consistent set of assumptions about driving forces and
