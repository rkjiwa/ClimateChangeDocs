INTRODUCTION

“We are becoming more  
vulnerable to the impacts 
of climate variability and 
change because of increasing 
urbanisation, a growing and 
Aging population and  
deteriorating public  
infrastructure. These changes 
put more people, property and 
ecosystems at risk.”  
- Black et al.2 

This guide has been prepared to help communities in British 
Columbia (B.C.) identify and prepare for some of the impacts 
of climate change. It provides information on how you can 
use urban forests to manage some of the impacts of changing 
climates, and how to adapt these urban forests so that they 
survive and thrive in future climates. 

This is a high-level overview that can be used by staff and 
elected officials in B.C.’s communities—small and large, rural and 
urban—including those who do not have professional arborists 
or urban foresters on staff. If you have comments or suggestions 
to improve this resource, please contact

Global Climate Change

The Earth is heating up. While natural causes have played a role, 
most of the atmospheric warming observed over the last 50 
years is attributed to burning of fossil fuels, land clearing, and 
other human activities that have increased the concentrations of 
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This has already changed 
climates in British Columbia and around the world, and scientists 
warn that further climate change is unavoidable.1
