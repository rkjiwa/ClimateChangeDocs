Foreshore tenure could enable a local government to 
undertake a broader range of shoreline management  
and adaptation measures in response to coastal hazards.
A foreshore lease (or other form of tenure) could enable 
environmental enhancement to occur with less reliance 
on structural protection. Possible applications include 
beach nourishment or the creation of off-shore islands 
and sand dunes.

A foreshore lease does not absolve the holder of any 
responsibility under the Fisheries Act or Navigable Waters 
Protection Act.
There will be costs associated with a foreshore lease, 
which could range from a nominal cost to fair market 
value (prepaid or annual lease payment).
The applicability of this tool will be limited to areas with 
suitable shoreline conditions and bathymetry.
