Rosemont–La Petite-Patrie’s zoning bylaw to reduce the urban heat island effect24,25
Rosemont–La Petite-Patrie (population 131 000) is a central borough in Montréal, Quebec, that is very densely 
built. The urban heat island effect is pronounced in many parts of the borough. Urban heat islands are areas in 
cities where ambient air temperatures tend to be hotter than in surrounding areas. They occur where there is little 
vegetation and a high percentage of dark surfaces, such as tar roofs, asphalt roads and parking lots. 
In April 2011, the borough council revised its comprehensive zoning bylaw to include four regulatory measures 
aimed at tackling urban heat islands: (1) when replacing an existing roof or constructing a new building, the owner 
must install either a green roof or a highly reflective roof; (2) for all new parking lots of 10 or more spaces, at least 
15 percent of the area must be open ground landscaped with plants, bushes and trees; (3) all new paving materials 
must meet a minimum specified surface reflectivity rating; and (4) when constructing a new building, at least 
20 percent of the building site must remain open ground and be landscaped with plants, bushes and trees. 
These four measures apply to all public and private property throughout the borough. More than 300 permits for 
reflective roofs were issued in the first year after the bylaw was passed.
