Table 3: Climate risks, impacts, and adaptation practices for road transportation.  

Climate / 

environmental risk 

factors

• 

• 

Impacts and opportunities

Adaptation actions

Increased freeze-thaw cycles 

• 

Increase use of road de-icing materials 
(i.e. salt, sand, brine) 

Thermal expansion of bridges, 
causing detours and traffic 
disruptions 

Warmer air 

temperatures 

(summer and winter; 

more variability)

•  Pavement rutting, softening, 

flushing, and bleeding in heat 

•  Reduced operating season/load 

capacities for winter roads 

• 

Longer construction season 
(opportunity)

•  Reduced winter road 

maintenance requirements 
(opportunity)
Increased likelihood of road 
washouts and flooding 

• 

• 

Increase ongoing maintenance

•  Use more heat-resistant pavement 

materials (i.e. “SuperPave” 
technology”); more frequent 
monitoring/maintenance

• 

Seasonal scheduling adjustments/
modal shift to air for northern shipping

• 

Improvements to stormwater 
management infrastructure 

•  More extreme rainfall and 

•  Regular monitoring and clearing of 

flooding 

culverts

•  More rapid asphalt/concrete 

•  Change to engineering design criteria 

deterioration

to consider higher precipitation volumes

• 

Increased risk (>45%) of vehicular 
accidents during heavy 
precipitation events, especially 
freezing rain 

Increased risk of flooding, 
especially from earlier and 
increased river ice breakup-
induced flooding 

Shorter winter road operating 
season 
Increased runoff from road-
treatment chemical dispersion 

• 

• 

• 

• 

ITS applications, warning motorists 
of safety hazards; RWIS, informing 
maintenance activities

Selection of more robust pavement 
materials 

Increase in road de-icing materials (salt, 
sand, brine)
Investment in flood prevention 
infrastructure

•  Modal shift to air transportation

•  No adaptations identified in the 

literature

Precipitation 

(changing seasonal 
patterns, increasing 

intensity and 

extremes)

Changing patterns of 

lake ice

Wind (changes 
in average wind 

speeds and 
extremes)

Changing water 
levels (lakes and 

rivers)

• 

• 

• 

• 

Loss of visibility, stability, 
maneuverability in drifting snow; 
disruptions to signaling equipment 
and tall structures 

•  Design structures for more turbulent 

conditions; “living snow fences” in rural 
areas

•  Risk of roadway inundation 

•  Relocation or elevation of roadways 

exceeding stormwater capacity 
of culvert infrastructure 

away from floodplains
