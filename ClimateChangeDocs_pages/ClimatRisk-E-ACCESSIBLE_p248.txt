5.0 RAIL TRANSPORTATION: IMPACTS AND ADAPTATIONS

5.1 PAST IMPACTS AND FUTURE RISKS 

Rail infrastructure in Atlantic Canada is affected by a changing climate and extreme weather in 
many of the same ways as roads. For example, flooding (caused by extreme precipitation, storm 
surge, and ice jams) has resulted in impacts on both modes (Environment Canada, 2010), and 
snowstorms that inundated roadways in St. John’s, Newfoundland in 1959 and Prince Edward Island in 
1989 also buried and stranded trains (Environment Canada (2013b). 

STORM SURGE, COASTAL EROSION, AND SEA-LEVEL RISE

Coastal rail lines in Atlantic Canada are vulnerable to flooding, washouts, and damage associated 
with storm surge and erosion, which can sometimes result in derailments. For example, in 2003 
Hurricane Juan resulted in 1.5-2 m storm surges at Halifax Harbour that severely eroded shoreline, 
washed-out railway tracks (Figure 8), and washed several rail cars into the ocean at the Dartmouth 
rail yard (Bowyer, 2003a). Similarly, Hurricane Igor in 2010 caused rail-line damage, washout, and 
closures – these were especially pronounced in Newfoundland (Curtis and Ehrenfeld, 2012).

levels remained unusually high at the time of photography. (Source: Natural Resources Canada)
