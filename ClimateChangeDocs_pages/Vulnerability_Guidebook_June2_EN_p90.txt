1.2-D.     SFM criteria and objectives 
A primary aspect of structured decision making is defining what you are trying to achieve 
by actively managing a system. In other words, what are the management objectives?

This worksheet is critical to the vulnerability assessment, as 
the objectives listed here are referenced throughout the rest 
of the guidebook (especially Worksheet 4.1 and beyond). The 
central focus of the CCFM vulnerability assessment approach 
is to determine what impacts climate change may have on 
your ability to achieve your management objectives. Also, 
adaptation options defined later in the assessment process 
should be linked to these objectives.

This guidebook focuses on the national SFM criteria, as defined by the CCFM (2003, 2006) 
and listed below (see Appendix 3 for a complete list of indicators for each CCFM criterion).  
The system of interest that you have defined may use the same structure, or it may have 
different categories of criteria. List the management goals or objectives in your area, using 
whatever structure is relevant for your system.

Criterion 1.  Biological diversity: Maintaining biological diversity so that organisms and 

ecosystems can respond and adapt to environmental change.

Criterion 2.  Ecosystem condition and productivity: Ensuring that forest ecosystems 

can cope with and recover from natural and human disturbances and 
maintain their ecological functions and processes.

Criterion 3.  Soil and water: Modifying management techniques to minimize disturbance, 

erosion, and compaction.

Criterion 4.  Role in global ecological cycles (specifically forest carbon management): 

Ensuring that forests are able to depend on and contribute to self-regulating 
processes responsible for carbon, water, nitrogen, and other life-sustaining 
elements.

Criterion 5.  Economic and social benefits: Providing a broad range of forest goods and 
services over the long term, offering significant economic and social benefits.

Criterion 6.  Society’s responsibility: Reflecting social values in forest operations and 

recognizing that many rural communities depend on the forest for their 
economic, social, and cultural well-being.

Note: It may also be useful to reference any documentation on forest management 
planning, practices, procedures, and indicators that you use to achieve and track these 
management objectives. The assessment team may also want to explore any assumptions 
made in relation to the objectives (e.g., an objective that states “management practices 
will maintain forest cover strata as it exists today” likely assumes that climate will remain 
constant). Understanding these assumptions can aid during the vulnerability assessment 
steps in section 7.4.
