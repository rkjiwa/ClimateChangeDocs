To achieve flood-resiliency, Evergreen Brick Works has 
focused its efforts on an approach that was coined “Flood 
Management by Design & by Protocol”.
Relating to “Flood Management by Design”, Evergreen 
Brick Works has implemented the following actions:
•  Installed all electrical outlets above the 10-year flood line
•  Located all major electrical and mechanical rooms on 

the 2nd floor or higher

•  Ensured new walls and floors are made of  solid dense 

concrete to be easily washable and resistant to mold
•  Across locations where a framed wall needed to be 

installed, removable cement boards have been used to 
be easily washed and dried

•  Reprogrammed elevators to park on the 2nd floor 

when not in use

•  Used hollow plastic structures called “Cupolex” to 

raise the floor above 10-year floodline while reducing 
the quantity of  required concrete

•  Installed flood gates at all entry points around  

the buildings perimeter

•  Installed permeable concrete pavement to reduce 

water runoff from parking lots

•  Installed green roofs to reduce water runoff from roofs
•  Built cages and platforms for merchandise display in 

retail stores, so that the items are always displayed 
above the 10-year flood line

•  At the children’s program area, built closets and 

benches for placing backpacks and other items above 
the 10-year flood line

•  Installed 14 rain water cisterns that each retain 

approximately 20,000 liters of  water, or more than 
250,000 liters of  rainwater that could be used for 
pressure washing after the flood

Relating to “Flood Management by Protocol,” 
Evergreen Brick Works implemented the following 
actions:
•  Developed a comprehensive flood management plan, 

which includes procedures for weather watch, flood 
watch, flood alerting, evacuation and recovery
•  Developed a customized weather widget with 

centralized weather information and flood gauges 
that pulls the data from available sources in a central 
location for analysis and action by facilities staff
•  Integrated flood preparation checklist into daily 
standing orders for each activity taking place at 
Evergreen Brick Works

•  Implemented “flood walk” program to communicate 

key findings about the status of  flood readiness of  
various spaces to staff and tenants

•  Procured an inventory of  flood equipment (e.g., sump 
pumps, hoses, pressure washers, sanitizer sprays and 
large fans)

•  Designated a place of  refuge on higher floors, 

equipped with drinking water and food

•  Partnered with a nearby church in higher elevation 
up the adjacent hill to shelter children and others if  
necessary

•  Developed a confidential staff and tenants phone tree 

as well as critical contacts

•  Developed Flood Management, Flood Response and 

Floor Recovery teams including volunteers

•  Established partnerships with watershed authorities 

(TRCA) and their flood duty officers

•  Included a flood risk clause in the tenants’ 

agreements, as well as third party events’ agreements 
to ensure they are aware of  the risk and they take 
their own measures in addition to the site’s efforts
•  Informed every new hire about the site’s flood risk 

and their possible engagement in flood recovery 
and provided online and in-person health and 
safety training for cleanup assistance as part of  the 
orientation package
