Nova Scotia’s Municipal Climate Change Action Plan Guidebook: Yarmouth 
pilot project 
The Town of Yarmouth (population 6761) is on the 
Gulf of Maine in southwestern Nova Scotia. The town 
is vulnerable to sea level rise and storm surge flooding. 
In 2010, the Government of Nova Scotia required 
municipalities to prepare and submit a climate change 
action plan by 2013 as a condition for receiving federal 
gas-tax funds. In November 2011, the Province published 
the Municipal Climate Change Action Plan Guidebook 
to help municipalities prepare their action plans.86 
Yarmouth was one of three pilot communities to work 
through the Guidebook. The lessons learned were used 
to assist other municipalities in undertaking similar 
initiatives.
Yarmouth is developing a long-term strategic approach 
for managing climate change hazards. Between October 
2011 and February 2012, with assistance from the 
Dalhousie School of Planning, Yarmouth worked through the six steps in the Guidebook. Before submitting its 
Plan to the Province in 2013, the Town intends to host a public consultation session and continue to refine its 
Action Plan. Despite some challenges, town staff found it to be a useful process. In particular, the formation of 
the steering committee, composed of staff from different departments, has allowed colleagues to work together 
across functional areas.

2. Assess impacts and hazards.
3. Identify affected locations.
