The  definition  of  the  ‘past  period’  for  which 
observed GHG emissions are available and used to 
drive climate models is updated with each new IPCC 
assessment. For the most recent, Fifth Assessment 
Report, observations of GHG were used until 2005, 
after which emissions scenarios were used as inputs 
(see black vertical lines on Figure 5, Figure 6). Given 
that the IPCC report was published in 2013, one 
could question why the observations, which are 

available until the present day, stop being used in 
2005?  The decision on the last ‘past’ year is made 
by the climate community and reflects the time 
needed for climate scientists to produce climate 
simulations, publish their results in peer-reviewed 
scientific literature, and to write the chapters of the 
IPCC report. These processes are all time consuming 
endeavors and simply cannot be accomplished in 
one year.
