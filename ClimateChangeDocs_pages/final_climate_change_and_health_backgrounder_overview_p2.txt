CLIMATE CHANGE: BC HEALTH RISKS
The table outlines key health and community risks posed by climate change that have been observed in BC. 
Vulnerable groups such as young children, the elderly, people with existing cardiopulmonary and respiratory 
illnesses, low-income families and people with mental wellness challenges are at greater risk.

CLIMATE CHANGE HAZARDS PRIMARY IMPACTS

Storm surges  
(temporary flooding)

Sea level rise

Rising temperatures

Flooding  
(long-term and 
permanent inundation)

More frequent, severe 
and prolonged heat 
waves and urban 
“heat island” effects

Changes in infectious 
agents, introduction 
of new pests, longer 
disease transmission 
seasons in some areas
Increased production 
of pollens and spores
Increased frequency 
and intensity of storms 

More frequent, severe 
and prolonged drought

Extreme weather

Wildfires 

Increased prevalence of water-borne pathogens and contaminants 
Interruption of health services
Increased potential for mold growth
Infrastructure/property damage
