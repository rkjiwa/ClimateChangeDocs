Sea level rise adaptation options include protecting our coastlines with defences,  
accommodating higher water levels by elevating infrastructure, avoiding 
flood prone areas by focusing development elsewhere, and retreating via 
land acquisition etc. Choosing among options is a complex task that starts 
with a clear risk assessment detailing the magnitude and frequency of coastal  
flooding, identifying vulnerabilities and quantifying potential damages and 
losses. the City endeavours to find solutions that minimize the financial,  
social and environmental impacts of future flooding while ensuring near-shore 
amenities, access, views and other benefits are maintained. A city-wide 
sea level adaptation response will provide high-level direction to navigate 
through the complex issues and make civic investments without creating 
undue hardships in the short term. 
While the risk assessment is being completed, the City’s interim flood  
construction levels need to be revised, and associated Flood-proofing policies 
amended to provide certainty. policies will be revisited and updated upon 
completion of the City-wide sea level rise response strategy.

Strategic planning for sea level rise is complex given the uncertainty asso-
ciated with the rate of water level rise and changes in storm frequency, the 
environmental and financial implications of engineering solutions, and the 
long timeline for fundraising and implementing such unique capital projects. 
it took 30 years for the United Kingdom and the netherlands to add new 
storm protection after a disastrous coastal storm in 1953. While we are not 
expecting observable impacts from sea level rise for some time, we need 
to start thinking about options now. A comprehensive risk assessment is a 
recognized best practice and first step toward planning actions to mitigate 
the risks posed by sea level rise.
Continuing to coordinate with other municipalities regionally, with other 
levels of government, and with partners such as port MetroVancouver will 
be integral to maintaining the economic vibrancy of the region. 

the flood risk assessment will include the following general phases of work:
•  Phase 1: Flood hazard mapping/modeling
•  Phase 2: Vulnerability Assessment
•  Phase 3: Consequence Analysis
•   Phase 4: risk Management options/trade-off Analysis
risk assessment outputs will support development of a city-wide sea level 
rise adaptation response that will address new infrastructure needs, erosion 
protection considerations, land use regulation changes and plans for ameni-
ties such as beaches and the seawall.
