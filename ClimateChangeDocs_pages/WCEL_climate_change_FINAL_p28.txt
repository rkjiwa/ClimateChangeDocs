Regional growth strategies

Integrating climate change adaptation into  
regional growth strategies or regional-scale planning

There are three main areas where regional growth strategies can promote climate change 
adaptation:

1.  Regional  growth  strategies  should  require  that  regional  district  policies,  plans  and 

regulations consider climate change impacts.

The Okanagan Similkameen Regional District regional growth strategy states 
that the region’s vulnerability to climate change should be considered in 
planning. South Okanagan Regional Growth Strategy (amended September 2011).

•	 Metro Vancouver’s regional growth strategy states that climate change 

and natural hazard risk assessments should be incorporated into the 
planning and location of Metro Vancouver utilities, assets and operations.

Policy documents prepared in 2010 for the development of the regional growth 
strategy for the Capital Regional District also propose that climate change 
adaptation be considered in all decision-making, planning and regulatory 
measures. Climate Change (Fall 2010). http://sustainability.crd.bc.ca/media/1280/

2.  High level objectives regarding climate change impacts of common concern among 

local governments within a regional district should be established.

•	

The Comox Valley Regional District regional growth strategy identifies water 
supply shortages as an issue that is being exacerbated by climate change 
in the region and sets out a number of high-level policies targeted at water 
conservation. Comox Valley Regional Growth Strategy (adopted March 2011).

3.  Regional  scale  climate  change  issues  should  be  addressed,  to  ensure  that  local  ap-

proaches have a coordinated and mutually beneficial effect overall.

•	

The Comox Valley Regional District proposes regional floodplain mapping 
and management to deal with climate change and sea level rise. Comox Valley 
Regional Growth Strategy (adopted March 2011). www.comoxvalleyrd.ca/

Approaches that 
maintain and enhance 
the interconnectedness 
of communities with 
natural systems — low 
impact development, 
green infrastructure for 
rainwater management, 
protecting ecological 
values within urban 
boundaries — seem 
to offer increased 
resilience to a changing 
climate as well as 
important co-benefits.
