Worksheet 2.4.   Identify uncertainties and knowledge gaps

Record and describe key uncertainties or knowledge gaps that arise throughout the 
assessment process. The point is to record them here for use when working on later 
worksheets (e.g., addressing these knowledge gaps can be an adaptation option that 
increases adaptive capacity). Donâ€™t dwell on the uncertainties and gaps; at this stage, 
simply acknowledging that they exist can help move the assessment process forward.

scenarios identified during the vulnerability assessment process.
