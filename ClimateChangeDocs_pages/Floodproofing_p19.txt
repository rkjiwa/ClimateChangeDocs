1. May be difficult and expensive to 
introduce into existing buildings. 
 
2. The requirement to access the 
components for servicing may limit 
the effectiveness of the enclosure.  
 
3. In some applications, the 
enclosure is normally open and must 
be closed and sealed before the 
flood arrives. 
 
1. May not be feasible for all 
components or may require custom-
designed components. 
 
2. Requires human intervention to 
remove and relocate vulnerable 
components in advance of a flood.

maintenance.  
 
2. Once a valve on a sewer pipe is 
closed, drainage from the building 
will be blocked and may overflow if 
sinks, toilets etc. are used
