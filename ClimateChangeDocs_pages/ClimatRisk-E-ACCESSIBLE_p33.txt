EXAMPLES OF IMPACTS ON URBAN 

TRANSPORT

① Flooding, damage, and wash-outs of 

surface infrastructure (e.g., culverts, roads, 
sidewalks, bicycle paths) 

② Flooding of underground transit systems 

(e.g., subway tunnels)

③ Buckling of rail transit lines 
④ Damage to traffic signals, signage, fallen 

power lines, trees obstructing routes 

⑤ Loss of power (overhead electricity for 
streetcars/trolleybuses, traffic signals)

⑥ Reduced traction/stability of vehicle, 

visibility issues

⑦ Damage to and deterioration of roads 

and bridges

CLIMATE FACTOR(S)

 • Extreme precipitation (heavy rainfall) and associated 

drainage issues, ice-jam flooding

 • Storm surges/sea level rise in coastal areas
 • Extreme precipitation (overloading drainage systems)
 • Extreme cold (cracking water mains)
 • Extreme heat or large temperature fluctuations 

 • High winds
 • Extreme precipitation
 • Freezing rain
 • Extreme precipitation
 • High winds
 • Freezing rain
 • Extreme heat
 • Extreme precipitation 
 • Freezing rain
 • High winds (including blowing snow)
 • High temperatures (pavement softening, rutting, 

flushing, bleeding)

 • Freeze-thaw cycles (pavement deformation, shearing, 

deterioration)  

 • Warming and thawing of permafrost (ground 

settlement, slope instability, drainage issues, cracking) 

 • Extreme precipitation (weakened embankments, 

depressions, bridge scour)

ADAPTATION APPROACHES

Transportation owners and operators are using a variety of different approaches to reduce climate 
risks, including: 

• 

Integrating climate considerations into organizational planning, policies and designs - known as 
“mainstreaming”, this refers to the practice of systematically considering climate risks in broader 
organizational plans and requirements.

•  Undertaking risk and vulnerability assessments - processes that assess the vulnerability of 

transportation infrastructure and operations to climate change and associated risks. Results can 
inform investments and operational decisions. 

• 

• 

Implementing structural and physical (engineering) adaptations - solutions that enhance the 
physical resiliency of transportation networks or infrastructure components. In some cases, 
structural adaptations are part of broader climate adaptation strategies and programs.

Integrating smart technologies - monitoring and communications technologies and tools, these 
can provide climate and weather data to support adaptation decision-making, and allow real-
time monitoring of asset conditions.

•  Changing operations and maintenance practices - this category of approaches is often the most 

cost-effective to implement.
