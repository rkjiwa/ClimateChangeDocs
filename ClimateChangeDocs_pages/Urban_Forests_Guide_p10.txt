Climate Change  
and Your 
Comunuity

 
From Impacts to 
Adaptation: Canada in 
a Changing  
Climate 2007 (Natural 
Resources Canada, 2007) 
includes a discussion of 
expected climate change 
impacts and case studies 
of responses.

Future climates and related impacts will vary from place to place, 
but all communities in B.C. will be affected in some way. This 
guide does not provide detailed information about future climate 
predictions for specific regions in B.C., but that information is 
available from the Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium4  (PCIC). 
A good place to start is the PCIC Plan2Adapt website,  which 
includes information on predicted impacts by regional district. 
PCIC can also provide information tailored to your community. 
Projected climate changes for British Columbia as a whole, and 
some of the ongoing and expected impacts, are described below.

Climate Change in B.C.

Places in the northern latitudes—such as British Columbia—
are expected to experience greater warming than the global 
average. Climate scientists expect that all parts of the province 
will be warmer, especially in the winter, with the greatest 
increase in northern B.C. (Figure 2). Winters will likely be wetter 
throughout the province, with smaller snow packs and earlier 
snowmelts. Southern and central B.C. are expected to get drier 
summers, while the northern B.C. summers are likely to be wetter 
(Figure 3).6  Changes will vary by region and by altitude.
