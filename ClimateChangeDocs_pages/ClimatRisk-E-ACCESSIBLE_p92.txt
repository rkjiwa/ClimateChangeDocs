PINE PASS - JUNE 2011

Fifteen sites along Highway 97 in the Pine Pass were damaged during a 1-in-100-year rainfall event 
on June 25th and 26th, 2011 (British Columbia Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure, 2014a).  
Damages included road washouts and flooding (overtopping) of bridges (Figure 9). The storm 
affected the entire Peace Region of British Columbia, with major floods and washouts damaging 
more than 280 sites on about 140 roads.  Road access, north of Prince George was closed, restricting 
tourist travel between British Columbia and Alaska. Transportation infrastructure repairs arising from this 
storm took through the summer of 2012 to complete and resulted in repair costs of $80 million.
