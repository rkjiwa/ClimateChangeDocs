Protecting your home and property

If you do purchase (or have already purchased) a home in a flood-prone 
area, there are many ways you can reduce the risk of water damage.

Simple, inexpensive actions include:

  Storing valuable and important items or documents on upper 

floors.

  Anchoring fuel sources.

  Sealing cracks in the foundation and around doors and windows.

  Installing backflow valves on basement floor drains, washing 

machine drains, toilets and sink drains.

  Installing a sump pump.

When making improvements to your home, consider the following:

  Tiled floors with waterproof adhesive and grout.

  Flood-resistant exterior doors.

  Raising electrical sockets on the first floor.

  Flood-resistant drywall.

  Moving large appliances, furnaces, hot water heaters and 

electrical panels out of the basement or ground floor and above 
the FCL. Alternatively, use risers to keep them off the floor.

  Permeable paving surfaces for sidewalks and driveways.

  Installing permanent safeguards, such as self-closing flood 

barriers, designed to keep water out of your home for as long as 
possible.
