Talk about what has happened to help get 
yourself and your family back on track. 

Some suggestions when talking to children
• Encourage children to express themselves and ask  
questions. They may want to do this by drawing or  
playing instead of talking.

• Take their fears seriously. Reassure them and  

give them additional attention. 

• Let children know they are not to blame when  

bad things happen. 

• Admit to them that you also felt afraid and may  

still be experiencing some feelings of fear or anxiety,  
but that with time and possibly some outside help  
you will work it out together.

• Tell children what you know about the situation.  

Be honest but gentle. Talk to them about the disaster.

• Keep children with you whenever it is possible, even if it  
seems easier to look for housing or help on your own.  
At a time like this, it’s important for the whole family  
to stay together.

• Expect regressive behaviour and be tolerant of it.
• Give them a real task to do, something that gets the  
family back on its feet and let them help in planning 
something to remember the loss.

• Watch for health problems and signs of stress, such  
as nightmares and depression, in you or your family.  
Seek help if you need it. Many organizations in your 
community can provide counselling and other supports.

• Model self-care and continue with regular routines (teeth 
brushing, bedtime stories) and chores (picking out their  
own clothes to wear, etc.). Get enough sleep and exercise.

• Avoid or minimize watching news reports of  

frightening events.
