5.1 PAST IMPACTS AND FUTURE RISKS

EXTREME PRECIPITATION

Rail company geotechnical engineers cite challenges with surface water and drainage related to 
extreme precipitation, including the fouling of track ballast and increasing risks of washouts. Fouling 
limits the ballastâ€™s ability to shed water away from the track area (Michael Hendry, Canadian 
Rail Research Laboratory, University of Alberta, personal communication, 2015) and reduces 
the resistance of rail infrastructure to frost heaves (shifting soil or rock during freezing conditions) 
(Nurmikolu and Silvast, 2013). 

Anecdotally, standing water is an increasing problem. One long-time regional geotechnical 
expert indicated seeing water against-grade in Saskatchewan in places not seen in 30 years in the 
business (Tom Edwards, Canadian National Railway, personal communication, 2015). The situation is 
particularly problematic if culverts freeze in spring. Frozen culverts restrict water flow, increasing the 
risk of washout and the likelihood and severity of track damage (Figure 7) (Michael Hendry, Canadian 
Rail Research Laboratory, University of Alberta, personal communication, 2015). 

These consequences affect reliability and efficiency of rail movement, as well as profitability, as rail 
companies typically own infrastructure and incur any necessary costs to maintain tracks to federal 
standards.
