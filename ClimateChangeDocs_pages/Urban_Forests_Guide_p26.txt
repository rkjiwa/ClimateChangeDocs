Figure 11: Structural soils

This system both serves as a parking lot and as a stormwater 
management facility. In addition to this double use of space, the 
structural soils also provide vastly greater soil volumes for tree root 
growth than traditional parking lot construction. Note: Gravel base 
course is optional, since the structural soil is designed to be as strong as 
the base. Figure by Sarah Dickinson

A study of the heat island effect in the City of Toronto found that residents could save about $11 million per 
year in energy costs. Savings from cool roofs (green roofs) are about 20%, shade trees 30%, wind shielding of 
trees 37%, and ambient cooling by trees and reflective surfaces 12%.32

Studies in the U.S. found that three mature trees around energy-efficient homes can reduce a typical home’s 
heating demand by 25–43% and peak cooling demand by 12–23%.33
