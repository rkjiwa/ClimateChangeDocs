Snapshot of anticipated Changes
averages A 
increase of 6% and 9% in winter and decrease of 15% and 14% in the 
summer by the 2050s and 2080s respectively. 
wet days B, C  
By the 2050s, precipitation during extremely wet days is expected 
to increase 28% relative to the baseline period (1971-2000).
extreme events C 
By the 2050s, a daily rainfall event that occurred once every 25 
years in the past is expected to occur almost 2.5 times as frequently.
averages A  
Annual increase of 1.7°C by the 2050s and 2.7°C by the 2080s.
warm days  
Summer days above approx. 24°C are projected to occur more than 
twice as frequently in the 2050s than during the baseline period 
1971-2000.
extreme events 
in the 2050s, an extreme heat event that occurred once every 25 
years in the past is expected to occur over 3 times as frequently.

averages 
the province of B.C. recommends using 0.5m global mean sea level 
increase to 2050, 1.0m to 2100 and 2.0m to 2200. there is a wide 
range of projections for sea level rise by 2100 from 45cm to over 2m.
extreme events 
Sea level rise will cause problems when experienced together with 
storm surge. detailed storm surge projections are not available.
An increase in extreme events is projected including windstorms 
and heavy rainfall. 

the following climate variables were modelled by  
pCiC for the region. they are all described against 
a 1961-1990 baseline unless otherwise stated. 
Precipitation as Snow: Vancouver’s drinking 
water comes from mountain reservoirs and the 
snowpack melt and rainfall that supply them. 
April 1 snowpack has decreased on average by 
25% in BC over the past 50 years with some sites 
experiencing a 50% reduction.12 
precipitation as snow is projected to decrease in 
the areas of Metro Vancouver that are important 
for water supply. reductions will be evident by 
the 2050s and precipitation as snow is projected 
almost to disappear by 2080. 
growing Degree Days: growing degree days 
(gdd) are an important indicator of opportunities  
for agriculture but may also increase the risk of 
invasive species spread. they are determined by 
the accumulation of degrees over 5°C per day. 
Annual gdds are a sum of degrees accumulated  
this way for each day of the year. regionally, 
modeled gdds are projected to increase by  
approximately one to two thirds in the 2050s and 
to as much as double by the 2080s from a baseline 
of approximately 1700 degree days. 
annual heating and Cooling degree days: Heating  
and cooling degree days are useful indicators 
of energy demands required for heating and 
cooling. HVAC systems, general building design, 
district energy systems and other energy infra-
structure all rely on this information. An approximate 
25% and 35% reduction by the 2050s and 2080s 
respectively in heating degree-days signals a  
significant reduction in cold season energy  
requirements. 

A Average change based on 30 global Climate Model projections. For range of uncertainty around the average see www.plan2Adapt.ca 
B With precipitation above the 99th percentile of wet days in the past. 
C Average change based on eight regional climate model projections.
