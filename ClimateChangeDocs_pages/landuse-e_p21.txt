Town of Ajax environmental review of land development and infrastructure projects
Ajax, Ontario (population 109 600), is located on the north shore of Lake Ontario. Climate change is expected to 
bring Ajax more frequent and more severe extreme weather. This, plus proposed urbanization in the region, could 
increase local risks such as flooding, fouled beaches and decreased water quality in Lake Ontario, the primary 
source of water for Ajax.51 
Ajax proactively uses EAs and EISs in its efforts to address climate change concerns. For example, to improve the 
quality of water discharged into Lake Ontario, Ajax is developing a master plan for the retrofit of its storm-water 
system. As part of that process, the Town conducted a Municipal Engineers Class EA to evaluate various retrofit 
measures.52 The EA recommended a two-stage action plan involving (1) adopting “Healthy Community Practices,” 
such as more strategic street sweeping practices, low-impact development approaches, community education 
programs and ongoing storm-water quality monitoring; and (2) using results from the monitoring program to 
determine whether engineered measures, such as retrofits to sewers, trenches and channel expansions, are needed. 
Further, pursuant to environmental and climate change adaptation policies in its Official Plan, Ajax requires that 
an EIS be submitted with all applications for developments on land designated as a natural heritage or hydrologic 
features of provincial, regional or local significance. The EIS must evaluate adverse impacts of the proposed 
development and establish appropriate actions to address those impacts.
