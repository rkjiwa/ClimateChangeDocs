Evacuation
For your protection, you may decide it is necessary for  
you to evacuate your home or an area impacted by flooding.  
You may also be officially notified to evacuate. This notification 
may occur in several ways including: 
• a weather alert
• social media
• local media
• officials going door-to-door
If you expect you might need to evacuate during an emergency, 
keep phone lines open for use by emergency workers and 
monitor local radio, TV, and the Internet for emergency 
instructions and current information. Also be sure to follow 
instructions from officials and evacuate immediately if asked. 
Travel only on routes specified by officials—a shortcut could 
take you to a blocked or dangerous area. If you have time and 
can do so safely:
• Take your Go-Kit (refer to Before a Flood for more details), 
medications, and needed supplies with you in the event of  
an extended evacuation.

• If it is safe to do so, shut off water, gas and electricity in your 
home. If not, evacuate your home but do not go back inside 
until a utility company has confirmed it is safe. 

• Check to see if your neighbours require assistance.

Emergency Evacuation Centres
In some cases, an emergency evacuation centre may be  
set up to provide shelter and food to people affected by 
 the flood. If so:
• Leave a note if you have time (in a mailbox if you have one) 

telling others when you left and where you went. 

• If you are evacuated, register with the authorities at the 
evacuation or reception centre so you can be contacted  
and reunited with your family and loved ones.

• If you are going somewhere other than a designated centre, 
register with the centre, notifying them of your whereabouts. 
This helps to create an accurate record of flood victims.
