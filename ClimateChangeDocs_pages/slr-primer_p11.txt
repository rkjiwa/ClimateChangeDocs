In much of Atlantic Canada, sea level rise has exceeded the global increase due to the additional effect of 
regional subsidence of the Earth’s crust. This subsidence is caused by the gradual collapse and migration 
of an area of uplift that developed around the margins of the North American ice sheets and by additional 
water loading on the seabed of the Gulf of St. Lawrence as global mean sea levels have risen. This 
phenomenon is referred to as “glacial isostatic adjustment.”7 In Nova Scotia, subsidence is estimated to be up 
to 20 cm/century.8 In Halifax, approximately half of the relative sea level rise is due to global mean sea level 
rise, with the remaining half due to regional subsidence. 

On the other hand, the north shore of the Gulf of St. Lawrence in Quebec and Labrador is rebounding. Based 
on long-term harbour records, the following sea level rise trends have been documented:

•  Halifax, Nova Scotia  
•  Yarmouth, Nova Scotia 
•  North Sydney, Nova Scotia  
•  Pictou, Nova Scotia  
•  Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island 
•  Saint John, New Brunswick 
Projected Increases in Sea Level
How will sea level change in the future? 

32 cm/century (records from 1920-2008)
30 cm/century (records from 1967-2008)
30 cm/century (records from 1970-2008)
24 cm/century (records from 1966-1995)
32 cm/century (records from 1911-2008)
22 cm/century (records from 1906-2008) 

How much sea level rise will occur is subject to uncertainty – and the longer the time frame, the greater the 
degree of uncertainty. 

In its Fourth Assessment Report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projected global sea 
level rise using six different scenarios of future greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Variables used to determine 
GHG emissions included population projections, economic growth and the use of technology. 

Depending on the IPCC scenario used, the estimated rise in global sea level to the end of this century (i.e. 
2100) varies from 18 to 59 cm. Based on the large body of research which has taken place since the IPCC 
scenarios were prepared in 2007, these projections may be quite conservative. Recent scientific research 
based on empirical relationships between atmospheric carbon concentrations and sea levels in the 
paleoclimatological record suggests that the upper bounds of physically plausible sea level rise is larger  
than once thought, owing to thermal expansion and glacial and ice sheet melt. These “semi-empirical”  
studies generally project a sea level rise of between 0.47 m and 1.9 m by the year 2100.9  

Both B.C. and Atlantic Canada recommend planning for sea level rise of approximately 1.0 m by the year 2100. 
A 2011 study for the Government of B.C. recommended sea level rise planning levels of 0.5 metres (50 cm) to 
the year 2050, 1.0 metre to the year 2100 and 2.0 metres to the year 2200.10 This is higher than the 2007 IPCC 
scenarios but is consistent with sea level rise projections used for planning purposes in Europe and the U.S.A.

Even if drastic measures are undertaken to slow down or even stop carbon emissions, sea levels will 
continue to rise for many centuries after global temperatures stabilize: a reality which has significant 
implications for local government planning.11 Planning for sea level rise presents a challenge for local 
governments; especially as many communities in Canada are relatively young and growing rapidly. For 
example, the first local government to be incorporated in B.C. was New Westminster in 1859 and the oldest 
continuously occupied building in the province is less than 170 years old.
