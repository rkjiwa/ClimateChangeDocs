CHAPTER 7    THE WORKSHEETS

The worksheets in this chapter are provided as guidance for completing an assessment 
of SFM vulnerability to climate change and for identifying and implementing adaptation 
options, as defined in the assessment framework (Williamson et al. 2012). The worksheets 
represent one suggested approach to applying the assessment framework, and users of 
this guidebook are encouraged to adapt them as required. The worksheets are structured 
to stimulate and guide discussion within the assessment team and among interested 
parties; they can also serve as cues for the types of information that will be useful for 
the assessment. However, users should not be constrained by the tabular format of the 
worksheets and should record information in whatever format is deemed most suitable. 

Although sequential completion of the worksheets is recommended, it is not essential, 
and users may find that an iterative process is required as the assessment project unfolds. 
In addition, some worksheets or parts thereof will not be useful for certain projects. Each 
assessment team must determine which worksheets will be most helpful for its own 
project and what will be the best method for completing the worksheets, given the 
resources available. 

H I N T

The Forestry Adaptation 
Community of Practice has  
been established as a go-to 
source of assistance for  
forestry resource professionals 
using this guidebook:  
http://ccadaptation.ca/facop. 
This online community contains 
forums to post questions, 
offer or access advice and 
experience, and network with 
other individuals interested in 
adapting forestry to climate 
change. Users of this guidebook 
are encouraged to use the 
community to share information 
about and lessons learned from 
their respective vulnerability 
assessments.
