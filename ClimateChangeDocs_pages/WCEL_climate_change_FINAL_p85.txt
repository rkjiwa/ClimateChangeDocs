Local  governments  have  important  responsibilities  to  their  communities  with  respect  to  public 
safety, and the protection of people and property in the face of natural hazards.

Some of the projected climate change impacts for BC, which vary by region, that may be relevant for 
local governments to consider in relation to natural hazards include:3

Increased risk of wildfires;

Increased risk of flooding;

Increased risk of landslides on steep slopes;

Sea level rise;

Increased incidence of invasive species; and

Increased incidence of extreme storm events.

To prepare for natural hazards in the context of climate change, local governments need to obtain 
the climate information relevant for their region, quantify risk and assess their vulnerabilities, and 
then determine appropriate responses. Local governments can obtain information about projected 
climate impacts for their regions from Plan2Adapt, by contracting specifically with the Pacific Cli-
mate Impacts Consortium, by working with BC universities, through reviewing scientific literature, 
by enhancing staff capacity through training and collaboration, by hiring technical consultants, and 
other sources.

Applying the information about local risks and vulnerabilities to land use planning is in some ways 
very similar to conventional planning for natural hazards by local governments: land use needs to be 
determined so that the risks faced by different geographic areas within the community are accept-
able in terms of the type of development and permitted uses in that area. Where risks are inevitable, 
planning needs to ensure that emergency responses can be carried out as effectively as possible and 
that key infrastructure functioning is maintained.

What is different about preparing for climate change is that assessments of risk and vulnerability 
based on historical events will not be good predictors of the risks faced in future, unless they factor 
in climate change projections. As well, risks and vulnerabilities should be periodically reassessed to 
incorporate evolving and updated information about climate change impacts.

3  The risks related to natural hazards associated with climate change will be different for every region, and 

each local government should assess its own risks and vulnerabilities, incorporating climate information from 
sources such as Plan2Adapt http://pacificclimate.org/tools-and-data/plan2adapt
