Permanently install any necessary wall-mounted hardware for
removable shutters before a storm threatens. Number all shutters and
keep all of the removable hardware accessible for quick installation.

Porches and overhangs
Porches and overhangs are obvious targets for storm-force wind
damage. They protrude from homes and are typically constructed with
lighter materials (wood vs. bricks). Porches and overhangs are
frequently the initial points for structural damage in a violent storm.
Many of the columns that support porch roofs or overhangs provide
adequate support for the weight of the roof but offer little resistance
to uplift forces. In a violent storm, these forces can actually be much
larger than the weight of the roof it is expected to support. Make sure
that the columns are adequately connected so that they hold the roof
down, as well as holding it up. 

Garage Doors
While garage doors may be the largest and weakest opening of a
home, they are often forgotten when storm-proo!ng. If the garage
door fails during a storm, the full fury of the storm may enter the

home and blow off the roof
and destroy the home.
Homeowners should look for
a sticker indicating pressure
rating suitable for their
location. If there is no sticker,
consider three options:
왘 Install a garage door with

one that is pressure-rated or
pressure- and impact-rated.

왘 Install aftermarket vertical

braces that are building
code approved and
available at a local home
improvement store.

Garage doors can be the weakest opening 
of a home in a severe wind storm.

왘 Check with the garage  door manufacturer for a kit to strengthen

the door and its track so that it has the properties found in new
wind-rated doors appropriate for your location. Garage doors
