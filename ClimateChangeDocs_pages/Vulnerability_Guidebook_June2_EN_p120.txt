4.2.5     Institutions 
Institutions are the laws, policies, customs, traditions, accepted practices, property rights, 
rules, norms, protocols, and standards that guide, direct, prescribe, or motivate forest 
management decisions and choices. Institutions can be formal (e.g., laws and policies) or 
informal (e.g., norms and customs). 

Successful adaptation (i.e., adaptation that is rational, effective, and justified) requires 
that institutions allow for consideration of the current and potential future impacts of 
climate change on forests and on human values associated with forests. That is to say, 
institutions that effectively account for climate change provide the motivation, incentives, 
and authority for rational adaptation, along with disincentives or sanctions for failure to 
adapt (in cases where adaptation is warranted) or for maladaptation (i.e., inappropriate 
or unjustified adaptation). Institutions represent a key component of adaptive capacity, 
because those that fail to account for climate change will likely act as barriers to rational 
adaptation. 

One of the major challenges to forestry institutions is to account for the increased levels 
of complexity and uncertainty associated with forest management policy, planning, and 
decision making under a changing climate. Institutional characteristics that are typically 
favoured by decision makers and stakeholders are lack of ambiguity, predictability, fairness, 
efficiency, stability, and consistency. However, under a changing climate, the following 
characteristics of forestry institutions are desirable: they explicitly recognize the potential 
impacts of climate change; they are forward-looking, while accounting for the significant 
uncertainties of future forest conditions and forest values under a changing climate; they 
are flexible; they are responsive; they accommodate or incorporate a diverse range of 
management options and forest conditions; they enable or permit adaptation to local 
impacts; they permit or enable, to some degree, an adaptive management approach; and 
they provide appropriate incentives for building adaptability or adaptive capacity.      

The influence of institutions on the adaptive capacity of SFM systems can be assessed 
in various ways. The table below presents a number of questions related to general 
characteristics of forest management institutions, followed by an assessment of specific 
climate change adaptability considerations related to SFM policy, assessment and 
monitoring, forest management planning, and forest management practices (e.g., 
reforestation, harvesting).
