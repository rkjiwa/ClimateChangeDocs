Provincial Climate Action Initiatives 

The Province is undertaking a variety of initiatives to mitigate and adapt to climate change. These include 
the following. 

•	 The Greenhouse Gas Reduction Targets Act (2007) set legislated targets of provincial emissions 

reductions of 33% below 2007 levels by 2020 and 80% below 2007 levels by 2050. 

•	 The B.C. Climate Action Plan (2008) outlines strategies and initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas 

emissions. 

•	 More than 179 local governments have signed the Climate Action Charter, committing to carbon 

neutrality by 2012. 

•	 The Climate Action Toolkit is a website providing information and cases studies of local government 

•	

initiatives towards climate action. 
 Preparing for Climate Change: British Columbia’s Adaptation Strategy (2009) outlines government’s 
approach to adaptation, builds on the Province’s past accomplishments, and provides a framework for 
future climate change adaptation initiatives. 

•	 The B.C. Regional Adaptation Collaborative aims to advance adaptation decision-making in British 

Columbia. One of its programs is developing tools and adaptation plans for communities. 

•	 The Ministry of Forests, Mines and Lands established a Climate Change Task Team to review potential 

impacts of climate change on provincial forest and range resources and identify knowledge gaps, 
with recommendations provided in Preparing for Climate Change: Adapting to Impacts on British 
Columbia’s Forest and Range Resources 

•	 The Future Forest Ecosystems Initiative focuses on adapting B.C.’s forest and range management 

framework so that it continues to maintain and enhance the resilience and productivity of B.C.’s 
ecosystems as the climate changes. 

•	 The Zero Net Deforestation Act encourages an equal area of trees be planted for carbon storage 

to offset any forest land that is permanently cleared for another use. 

•	 The Community Energy and Emission Inventory is tracking land use change at the Regional 

District level, including an estimate of deforestation and the resulting CO2 emissions.
