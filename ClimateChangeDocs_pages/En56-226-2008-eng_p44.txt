To conduct any of the suggested methods, criteria will be
needed that will provide information about the trade-offs
between different responses, the urgency of needed responses
and  the  availability  of  resources  -  both  financial  and
institutional for implementation (table 3). A consultant may
also be required. 

By this step of the SAM project, you will have created a
list of adaptation responses that are a priority for the
short, medium and long term.

GUIDEBOOK FOR ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE  STEP  4

The case studies listed in this Guidebook provide examples of
implemented  actions  that  include  diverse  short-term  and
long-term measures. These actions include building water
storage  facilities  (Case  Study  9),  building  public  cooling
facilities and distributing water (Case Study 8), and installing
devices to generate electricity (Case Study 7).  The identified
adaptation often requires setting up long-term goals that will
be implemented continuously, such as funding programs for
local communities (Case Study 9), development guidelines
for  economic  diversification  to  minimize  dependence  on
services or forestry sensitive to weather and climate (Case
Study 2)  and  ensuring  long-term  monitoring  of  sea  ice
changes  and  distributing  this  information  to  community
users (Case Study 3).

At this step you need to evaluate our list of adaptation options
(Table 4 and 5) to climate change, select the most feasible
options and transform them into actual actions. There are
several methods (see Appendix 1) that can be used to select
adaptation options, including:

(cid:129)  Trade-off analyses

(cid:129)  Multi-criteria analyses

(cid:129)  Experts’ judgments

(cid:129)  Cost assessments: including cost-benefit analyses,

assessment of cost of adaptation, cost of inaction, and
cost-effectiveness analyses
