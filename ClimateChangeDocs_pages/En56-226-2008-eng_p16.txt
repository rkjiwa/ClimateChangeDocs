INTRODUCTION 

Climate Change

Climate is defined as the average temperature, precipitation
and  wind  over  a  period  of  time1.  Statistically  significant
variation in this average state for an extended length of time
is referred to as climate change. This change may be due to
natural or anthropogenic changes in the composition of the
atmosphere or changes in land use (IPCC 2001). Global and
regional observations of climate change have been recorded
worldwide. From  a  global  perspective,  eleven  of  the  12

warmest years on record (since 1850) have occurred between
1995 and 2006. The global average surface temperature has
increased  by  0.74°C  over  the  past  100  years  (Field  et  al.
2007). It is important to note that warming may not occur
steadily over time and will likely vary by season, even in the
same  location.  Extreme  temperatures,  such  as  daily  and
seasonal maximums and minimums are also likely to change
at different rates, with minimum temperatures increasing at
a greater rate than maximums in many locations. Table 1
presents a summary of observed and projected changes in
climate for Canada.

TEMPERATURE

(cid:129) Canada has warmed an average of 1.3°C over

(cid:129) 2 to 4°C increase in global average

the past 50 years – approximately twice the
global average

(cid:129) Stronger warming of daily minimum

temperatures than daily maximum temperatures

temperature by 2100

(cid:129) Average temperature increases in Canada

from 3°C on the East and West Coasts
to 5°C in the North

(cid:129) Nationally, 8 fewer frost days over the period

(cid:129) Springtime warming up to 10°C in the

1950-2003

far North

(cid:129) Increasing trends in heat spells (of one or more

(cid:129) Temperature increases greater in winter

and three or more days) in S. Quebec where
daily minimum temperatures are above 22°C,
but decreasing trends in heat spells where
maximum temperatures exceed 30°C

than summer 

(cid:129) Greater warming of extreme minimum
temperatures than extreme maximum
temperatures and reduced daily
temperature ranges

(cid:129) Increased frequency of winter freeze-

thaw cycles in cold climates, decreased
frequency in milder climates
