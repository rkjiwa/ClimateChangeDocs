Yukon ‘State of Play’:  
Analysis of Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation 
 
  Natural Resources Canada states that climate change during the 21st century is expected to 
result in more frequent large fires in many boreal forests: “Large wildfires, which can cause 
serious economic losses, are expected to become more frequent, but increases in mean 
annual area burned will be relatively gradual.” (Price et. al., 2013);

  Climate change impacts that could add damaged or dead wood to the forest fuel load (for 

example, from insect outbreaks, ice storms or high winds) may increase the risk of fire; and 

  Recent major wildfires in Fort McMurray (2016) and Interior British Columbia (2017) are 

important reminders of our limited ability to supress intense wildfires and avoid major 
losses of homes, businesses, and community infrastructure. 

The mechanism by which climate change can be expected to result in increased wildfire risk 
includes greater risk of dry winters and dry summers (through increased precipitation variability 
despite average precipitation increasing) and through increased heat and desiccation of existing 
fuel sources. There may also be trends in convective storms leading to more lightning strikes. 

4.3  ADAPTATION TO WILDFIRE HAZARDS 

In practical terms, the primary means of adapting to the increased likelihood and potential 
severity of wildfires in Yukon largely overlap with existing efforts to reduce risks, including: 

  More robust emergency preparedness and public infrastructure (including communication 

systems along with road access to vulnerable areas) will limit a broad range of risks and 
improve overall public safety; 

  Evacuation and emergency response plans, both at the household and community level. The 

Yukon Emergency Measures Organization is responsible for coordinating community-level 
plans, but it is up to individuals to both be aware of these plans and to create their own 
household plans;  

 

Land use planning that accounts for increased wildfire risks when planning new 
developments. One suggestion in the Whitehorse Community Adaptation Plan is to 
strategically place agricultural land developments as fire-breaks to reduce wildfire risk;  

  Encourage the increased use of fire-resistant building materials, including metal cladding, 

metal roofs and metal soffits, along with closing in areas under decks and porches, to 
provide better protection from wind-driven embers. Yukon Community Services already 
provides this advice to Yukoners, however, a more concerted public education campaign 
and incentive program, or possibly changes to building code requirements for rural-
residential lots, could further reduce risks; 

  Encourage fuel reduction (deadfall removal, tree thinning, replacement of conifer trees such 

as spruce with more fire-resistant birch or aspen) on private property. Yukon Community 
Services already provides this advice to Yukoners; however, a more concerted public 
education campaign and incentive program could reduce risks; and 

  Systematic identification and prioritization of fuel rich areas for targeted fuel reduction on 

public land near communities.
