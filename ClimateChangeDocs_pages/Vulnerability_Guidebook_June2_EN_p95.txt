Yes           No

Does your organization have a  
particular need to complete a  
vulnerability assessment of SFM  
objectives and climate change?

Are there regular planning 
processes (e.g., SFM plan, annual 
work plan?) into which climate 
change adaptation could be 
mainstreamed?

If you need a person to champion 
this assessment to ensure it goes 
forward within your organization, 
has someone been identified or 
assigned to the task?

Have you given thought to the 
human, financial, and information 
resources required to complete (or 
at least get a good start on) the 
vulnerability assessment?

Is your organization willing to 
implement adaptation actions?

Are groups and individuals that 
affect or are affected by your 
forest management decisions 
likely to support climate change 
adaptation?

Are there other factors that should 
be considered?
