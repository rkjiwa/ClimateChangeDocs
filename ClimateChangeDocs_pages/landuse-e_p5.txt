1.0 Introduction

Canada’s climate is changing rapidly. Although all levels 
of government have important roles to play to advance 
adaptation, action at the local level is particularly important 
because that is where many of the impacts of climate 
change will be felt most directly.1

Local governments in Canada can manage the risks and 
opportunities presented by climate through a variety 
of practices, including adoption and enforcement of 
bylaws; collection of taxes and user fees; operation of 
transportation, utilities and other public infrastructure; 
establishment of subsidies, tax credits and other incentive 
programs; administration of emergency management 
and response systems; and public outreach and 
education initiatives.

Land use planning is one of the most effective processes 
to facilitate local adaptation to climate change.3,4 
Historically, local governments have used land use planning 
tools – official plans, zoning, development permits and 
others – to minimize risks to communities from floods, 
wildfires, landslides and other natural hazards.5 As the 
climate changes, so will the frequency and magnitude of 
climate-related hazards, posing a challenge for community 
planners. A recent survey by the Canadian Institute of 
Planners confirmed that “planners gravitate to tools they 
know best and are looking for ways to adapt known tools 
when addressing climate change.”6 

Adaptation defined 
Climate change adaptation refers to actions that 
reduce the negative impact of climate change and/
or take advantage of new opportunities. It involves 
making adjustments in our decisions, activities and 
thinking because of observed or expected changes 
in climate.2

Some ways municipalities act 
•	 planning and land use controls: zoning, official 

plans, development reviews

•	 provision of public services: utilities, public 

transit, road maintenance, snow removal, fire 
and police, emergency preparedness

•	 forum for public dialogue and information: 
public awareness campaigns, deliberation 
on bylaws and programs, information on 
city services

•	 collection of taxes and user fees: property 

taxes, recreational facility fees, parking fees 
•	 management of public land and buildings: 
establishment of parks, renovation of civic 
buildings, operation of water treatment plants
