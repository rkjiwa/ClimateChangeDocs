The sensors provide real time, 
constant protection of the job site 
helps prevent events such as fire 
and water damage. Also, it acts as 
an early warning system to all 
stakeholders and can also link 
emergency response resources.

It can reduce insurance claims 
and deductibles by pushing alerts 
that allow contractors to pinpoint 
problem areas before damage 
occurs. Also Pillar helps gain 
insight into what did happen 
during construction that may 
have led to post construction 
defect claims.

Pillar provides site wide data to 
gain improved insight into what is 
happening on the job site in real 
time, providing a construction 
site nervous system that improves 
productivity and risk management.
