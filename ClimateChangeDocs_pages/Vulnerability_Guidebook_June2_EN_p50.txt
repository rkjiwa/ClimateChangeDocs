Strategic considerations  

Use the practitioner and local knowledge existing within your assessment team to describe 
a range of possible climate scenarios for the future. You may want to focus on the same 
change in climate (e.g., warmer and drier) over time, with variation in the degree or rate of 
change over time (e.g., minor change, moderate change, large change). Alternatively, you 
may want to look at a range of potential changes in climate (e.g., warmer and drier, warmer 
and wetter). The scenarios you choose should be relevant to your local or regional area. The 
idea is not to be predictive in your estimates of change but to describe a range of future 
climates. You will assess the sensitivity of SFM objectives to these changes in chapter 4.

Include a climate expert on the project team, who will prepare locally focused climate 
change projections and information. Expand the climate variables in the projections 
beyond temperature and precipitation to include factors that participants identify as being 
important to SFM, such as wind speed, frequency of freezeâ€“thaw cycles, changes in seasonal 
temperature and precipitation, fire weather index (FWIa) values, and climate moisture index 
(CMIb).

Seasonal conditions are crucial to operational decisions, making it important to report 
seasonal as well as annual projections. If possible, include in the climate scenarios seasonal 
climate variables that affect operational decisions. 

It is essential to encourage reasonable expectations about the certainty of future climate 
change projections. Some participants may expect to receive detailed projections for 
localized situations (e.g., a community forest area) and others may be discouraged by what 
they perceive as large uncertainties in the projections. In either case, it is important to 
remind participants that the purpose of the assessment is to explore what could happen if 
any of the projected range of climates were to occur in the future.

responsible for wildfires maintain FWI data records.
b The Climate Moisture Index (CMI) was originally described by Hogg (1994, 1997) as a method for assessing differences in moisture regimes using simple 
climate data (temperature and precipitation).
