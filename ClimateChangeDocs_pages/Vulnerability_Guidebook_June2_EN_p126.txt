Worksheet 4.3.   Assess current and future vulnerability

Use the results from the two preceding worksheets (Worksheet 4.1 and Worksheet 4.2) 
to complete Worksheet 4.3 (Assess current and future vulnerability).

Use the vulnerability matrix below to rank the current vulnerability of the SFM system in 
terms of the ability to achieve management objectives. Then rank the future vulnerability 
of achieving each SFM objective. 

Instead of seeking consensus on a single ranking, you may wish to provide a range of 
rankings from various sources.

Intuitive scan: Once you have completed the rankings for each objective, scan the 
vulnerability rankings to intuitively check for internal consistency and logical results. 
Explore inconsistencies by returning to the earlier worksheets to understand the 
background information that led to the ranking.

Once you have scanned and, if necessary, adjusted the vulnerability rankings for each 
objective, conduct a scan across all the objectives. This is particularly important if different 
focus groups completed the assessments for different objectives. Again, check for internal 
consistency and logic, and adjust as needed.

Use the impacts on SFM objectives determined in Worksheet 4.1 (Assess current and 
future impacts on SFM) and the assessment of adaptive capacity to climate change 
from Worksheet 4.2 (Evaluate adaptive capacity of the SFM system) to determine 
the vulnerability of SFM objectives under current climate conditions and future climate 
scenarios.

Use current adaptive capacity to assess the vulnerability of the SFM objectives (as listed 
in Table 1.9 in Worksheet 1.2-D) in each scenario. Use additional pages if necessary to 
describe the potential vulnerabilities that you identify.
