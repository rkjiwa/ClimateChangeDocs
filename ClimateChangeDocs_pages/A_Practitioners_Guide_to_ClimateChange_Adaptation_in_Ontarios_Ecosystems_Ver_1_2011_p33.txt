DEVELOP AND APPLY FUTURE SCENARIOS   

 

 

 
 
 
 
 

Step  3  incorporates  projections  of  future  climate  and,  where  possible,  projections  of  other  non-climatic  factors  such  as  population 
growth  and  development.  All  projections  vary  spatially  and  temporally,  ranging  from  large  scale  global  climate  scenarios  showing 
long-term changes to average temperature, precipitation and other variables, to impact assessments that integrate climate factors in 
regional or more localized ecological response models.  

Climate Models and Scenarios  

Climate models project the effect of higher concentrations of greenhouse gases based on increasing amounts of heat trapped in the 
atmosphere. Increased heat affects virtually all aspects of weather, including precipitation, wind, and humidity (Colombo et al., 2007). 
There are many ways to explore Ontario’s future climate with global models that project change to a variety of climatic variables. For 
example,  since  climate  change  varies  with  the  time  of  year  and  location,  practitioners  can  use  seasonal  climatic  variables  (e.g., 
summer  and  winter) for different  time  periods (e.g.,  2011-2040)  and  different  spatial frameworks (Figure  3).  Each  climate  model  is 
unique, is based on different assumptions, and produces somewhat different projections of future climate when provided the same 
data. In total, 24 international centres  provided Global Climate Model (GCM) data for the last IPCC assessment in 2007.
