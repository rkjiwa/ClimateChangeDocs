A basic approach

A comprehensive 
approach

Brainstorm with your colleagues to complete the worksheets. If possible, have a forestry 
climate change specialist review your findings.

For each SFM objective, or for logical groupings of objectives (e.g., biological diversity 
and ecosystem function and productivity), organize focus groups of scientists, technical 
specialists, practitioners, and policy specialists with expertise related to the objective. 
Facilitate a workshop with each group to complete the worksheet, based largely on the 
findings in Worksheet 3.2 (Develop and describe forest impact scenarios). Summarize 
the findings for review by all participants, particularly those who will be responsible for 
future decision making and/or implementation. 

Operational 
considerations  

Involve forest practitioners in the assessment process to gain an “on-the-ground” perspective 
about how changes in climate and forest conditions may affect the ability to achieve SFM 
objectives.

Strategic considerations  

When assessing climate change impacts, it is essential to consider nonclimatic factors, such 
as markets, jobs, and societal values. These are often strategic-scale factors that should be 
brought into the assessment. Refer to the driver papers from the Future Forests Project 
(http://www.sfmn.ales.ualberta.ca/en/Research/ForestFutures/ForestFuturesDocuments.

Climate Change 
Adaptation and 
Adaptive Capacity

In a climate change 
vulnerability assessment, 
adaptive capacity and 
adaptation are not 
equivalent.

Adaptation describes the 
action taken to reduce 
negative impacts related 
to climate change and to 
increase the magnitude 
and likelihood of positive 
impacts (e.g., research and 
training to learn more about 
climate change). 

Adaptive capacity is the 
condition of the system 
being assessed (e.g., low 
awareness of climate 
change or limited financial 
resources).

4.3.1     The Theory

Definition of Adaptive Capacity
Adaptive capacity has been defined as “the ability of a system to adjust to climate change 
(including climate variability and extremes) to moderate potential damages, to take 
advantage of opportunities, or to cope with the consequences” (Parry et al. 2007) (see 
sidebar Climate change adaptation and adaptive capacity). Adaptive capacity can 
moderate impacts to reduce the vulnerability of a system to climate change. 

Adaptive capacity is a crucial element of climate change vulnerability assessment. A 
system with high adaptive capacity can identify adaptation requirements and implement 
adaptation actions to reduce its vulnerability to climate change and to nonclimatic 
stressors and to take action on opportunities. 

Assessment of Adaptive Capacity 
Assessment of adaptive capacity remains one of the more challenging aspects of 
vulnerability analysis. The measurement and analysis of adaptive capacity is a relatively 
new and evolving area of study in general and a new area of consideration in forestry-
related assessments. The relevance of “adaptive capacity” in the day-to-day operations 
of Canadian SFM systems is increasing, in part because management environments 
are becoming more complex, uncertainty is increasing, and the pace of changes
