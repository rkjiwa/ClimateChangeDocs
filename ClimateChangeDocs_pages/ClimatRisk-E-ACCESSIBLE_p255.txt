An under-explored area of adaptation is the application of new technologies to reduce climate 
risk.  For example, the Fisheries and Marine Institute of Memorial University of Newfoundland and 
the Institute for Ocean Research Enterprise of Halifax have created the SmartAtlantic Alliance 
to further modernize Canada’s marine navigation system by providing accurate and real-time 
meteorological and hydrological data. Data generated by SmartAtlantic buoys (Figure 14) is used 
to produce high-resolution forecasts of weather and sea conditions, and for scientific research. 
The technology is currently in use at seven Atlantic ports (see Case Study 4) and allows the 
marine transportation industry, commercial and recreational boaters, researchers, and interested 
members of the public to access real-time, online data about regarding weather and directional 
wave information at these locations. It is designed to optimize efficiency without compromising 
navigational safety, and to enhance the reliability of port operations in a variety of weather and 
climatic conditions (Government of Canada, 2014; New Brunswick Department of Transportation 
and Infrastructure, 2015).
