Windbreaks can reduce typical home heating 
demand by 5–15% (1–3% for a single tree).44 

and their ability to reduce the ambient air 
temperature through evapo-transpiration.

Food Production  

As global temperatures rise, the tropics and sub-
tropics will be significantly affected, reducing 
food production in these areas and likely 
increasing food costs worldwide.

Provide Opportunities to Grow Local Food 
One of the benefits of changing climates is that 
many regions of B.C. will be able to grow fruits 
and other food crops currently associated with 
more southerly locations. Local food production 
also helps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
 

•	 Consider planting fruit and nut trees 

currently suited to more southerly climates,

in anticipation of being able to get them to 
produce fruit as they mature. Ensure they 
are hardy enough for the current climate, 
or provide appropriate winter protection 
such as mulching, wrapping stems, or 
windbreaks.

•	 Consider what opportunities there may be 
in parks or other municipal lands for local 
food production (e.g., community gardens, 
park trees). 

•	 Ensure that trees are placed and pruned to 

avoid shading community gardens.
