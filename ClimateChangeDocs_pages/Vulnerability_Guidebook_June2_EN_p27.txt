factors of change, such as local land-use trends and global economic trends, should also 
be included in your description of the SFM system.  

Explicitly describing your SFM system ensures that the vulnerability assessment addresses 
all the climate-sensitive dimensions of the system and takes into account the nonclimatic 
factors that may exacerbate or lessen climate vulnerabilities. The following sections 
provide background information on describing your SFM system.

Defining the Spatial Scale
The factors prompting a vulnerability assessment and adaptation planning project can aid 
in defining your assessment area, as they may indicate the spatial scale at which the issue 
is best examined. The appropriate spatial scale is often related to the decision context 
(or contexts) within which the issue is best addressed. Generally, the greater the scale of 
the issue, the more complex the assessment (with more stakeholders [interested parties], 
more policy linkages, etc.). Many climate change issues operate across multiple scales, a 
consideration that should be taken into account within any vulnerability assessment and 
adaptation planning project. For more information, see Theme 1: Spatial and Temporal 
Context in Gray (2012).

Local area – A smaller area provides the opportunity to explore vulnerability and 
adaptation to climate change in a very specific biogeographic and political context 
(e.g., a community forest or woodlot). Such assessments tend to be more operational in 
nature and the local management objectives may be more clearly defined compared 
with regional or national scales (see “Case study – Local area: Site prescriptions for fuel 
abatement and biodiversity conservation in Jasper National Park”). 

A lesson learned from 
forestry vulnerability 
assessment case studies 
(Johnston and  
Edwards 2013):
Defining the SFM system of interest, 
the scale, the scope, and the level of 
participation are the most critical 
steps in a vulnerability assessment. 
An assessment that is well matched 
to available resources and has the 
appropriate level of engagement 
from interested parties is likely to be 
more successful in implementing 
adaptation options and reducing 
barriers to new approaches and 
practices.

Case Study – Local area: 
Site prescriptions for 
fuel abatement and 
biodiversity conservation 
in Jasper National Park

For communities located at the wildland–urban interface, climate change may be of 
increasing concern because of anticipated changes in the forest fire regime. The FireSmart 
manual (Partners in Protection 2003), developed by the Partners in Protection program 
to support fuel abatement around communities, has been adopted and implemented 
by many communities across Canada, including Jasper National Park. Consistent with the 
principles of SFM, Jasper National Park has successfully integrated the management of other 
values, such as biodiversity and visual esthetics, into its site prescriptions for fuel abatement. 
While this example does not explicitly deal with climate change, it is an example of the 
operational nature of local risk and vulnerability assessments.

Regional area – Regional assessments (e.g., for a watershed, timber supply area, or forest 
district) represent a level of complexity above that of local studies. Assessments at this 
scale tend to demand more integration between different decision-making contexts, 
involve a larger number of stakeholders (or interested parties), and require more careful 
examination of trade-offs in the exploration of adaptation options. Regional assessments 
often address both strategic and operational considerations. Examples of regional area 
vulnerability assessments are highlighted in Johnston and Edwards (2013), and one 
example is summarized in “Case study – Regional area: Southwest Yukon.”
