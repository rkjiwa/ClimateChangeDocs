An important consequence of sea-level rise is the extreme water levels associated with wave run-up 
(also referred to as “swash,” the height above the still-water elevation of the sea) and storm surge (the 
difference between observed water level and the predicted astronomical tide, resulting from variations 
in atmospheric pressure and wind). Sea-level rise will result in both more extensive storm-surge flooding, 
and increased frequency of events that contribute to coastal flooding and erosion. For example, 
analysis for Halifax Harbour indicates that a 40 cm rise in sea level by 2050 will yield drastic changes in 
extreme water levels – by mid-century, storm surges which currently have a return period of once in 50 
years are likely to occur (on average) more than once every five years (Forbes et al., 2009).  

3.0 ATLANTIC CANADA’S TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM

The following sections discuss the physical assets and operations for each mode of transportation in 
Atlantic Canada, with an overview in Table 2, and an illustration of principle networks in Figure 3.
