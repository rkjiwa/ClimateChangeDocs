Types of flooding  
& flood prevention
Understanding your home’s two 
different water drainage systems
Water (both stormwater and wastewater) is collected from  
your home and typically drains away through lateral connection  
pipes to the stormwater or wastewater systems on your street. 
The stormwater system is designed to collect rain and melted 
snow (i.e. clear water) from streets and properties and direct this 
flow to a nearby pond, creek or lake. 
The wastewater system is designed to collect water from 
toilets, sinks, showers, laundry facilities and basement floor 
drains and direct it to wastewater treatment facilities where  
it is thoroughly treated.
Because your basement is below ground, it is most prone 
to flooding if there are blockages or backups in either the 
stormwater or wastewater systems.

Who Owns What?

Mississauga is responsible  
for the stormwater system.
Region of Peel is responsible  
for the wastewater system.
Homeowners are  
responsible for the lateral  
pipe connections from their 
home to the property line  
and ensuring proper 
maintenance of water 
drainage around the home.

Types of flooding 
If you’ve experienced flooding, it’s important 
to know what type of water is in the  
basement and understand what caused  
it so you know what steps to take to help 
prevent it from happening again. The main 
types of residential flooding are:
1.  Overland Flooding (flooding as a result of 
creeks or rivers overflowing onto dry land)

2.  Foundation Flooding (may be  

groundwater or water from roof  
drainage entering basement through 
cracks in basement walls or foundation 
(usally clear with no odour)

3.  Wastewater backup (greyish in colour  

and typically has an odour)

4.  Stormwater sewer backup (can reduce 

ability for foundation weeping tiles to  
drain (usually clear, may have an odour
