Properly preparing your home and community doesn’t completely
guarantee you won’t incur !re damage, but it does reduce the risk.
Make sure you have adequate insurance on your home and property.

Some of the measures in this manual cost very little and help reduce
your vulnerability to wild!re; others require planning and a long-term
commitment.

Let’s look at three areas where you can apply FireSmart principles to
protect or reduce the damage to your property from a wild!re. 

1. Site preparation 

Priority zone 3

Priority zone 2

Priority zone 1

10 m

20 m

70 m

Priority zones surronding an interface
building or group of buildings.

Any kind of vegetation is
combustible. 
Mature trees, shrubs, grass and even your
woodpile can easily ignite and increase the
chance of wild!re damaging your home and
property. Managing the space around your
home and buildings is of utmost importance.

Do you have a cleared zone around
your house and buildings? 
The 10-metre space immediately surrounding
your home is Priority Zone 1. It’s the most
critical area to introduce FireSmart principles.

A fuel-free space will give !re!ghters a chance to save your home
from an advancing wild!re. A home without a fuel-free space can
make !re!ghting dif!cult, if not impossible. 

What to do? 
Remove "ammable trees and shrubs, such as
pine, spruce and juniper. Other species such
as aspen, poplar and birch have lower
"ammability rates. Also remove deadfall or
woodpiles from this area. Keep your grass
mowed and watered.
