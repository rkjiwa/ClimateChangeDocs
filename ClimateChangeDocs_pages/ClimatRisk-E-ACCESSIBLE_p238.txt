3.1 ROAD AND RAIL TRANSPORTATION 

Atlantic Canadaâ€™s extensive surface transportation infrastructure (road and rail) reflects its regional 
importance in moving people and goods. Each Atlantic province is reliant on roads, while rail 
plays a very significant economic role in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick in the form of the CN Rail 
system that crosses the Chignecto Isthmus.  About $19.5 billion in trade flows annually by rail across 
the Isthmus, which represents about 45% of the total annual trade movements throughout Atlantic 
Canada (Webster et al., 2012; Marlin, 2013). The corridor is the only land connection between Nova 
Scotia and New Brunswick, and is highly vulnerable to storm surge and sea level rise (Figure 4; also see 
Case Study 5). A system of dykes, which includes rail embankments in some stretches, was originally 
built by the Acadians to create agricultural land and currently protects land and rail, road and other 
infrastructure in the Isthmus (Webster et al., 2012). 

A second important rail link in Atlantic Canada is a short section of rail in Labrador that connects to 
the Quebec North Shore and Labrador Railway (QNS & L).  The shipment of iron ore from Labrador 
via the QNS & L represents the largest component of total commercial rail tonnage moving out of 
Atlantic Canada (Stassinu-Stantec Limited Partnership, 2011). Prince Edward Island and the island of 
Newfoundland do not have operational rail lines, while a few independently-owned short-line systems 
operate in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia.
