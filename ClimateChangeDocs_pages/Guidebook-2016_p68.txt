Figure 21 |  Spatial analogue for the greater Toronto area for the 2080 horizon (2071-2100). A. The regions where  
the recent climate (1971-2000) is similar to the climate projected for the greater Toronto area in 2080  
 
 
(2071-2100).  B.  The regions  where the  projected  future climate (2071- 2100) is  similar  to  that  of  the  
greater  Toronto  area  for  the  recent  past  (1971-2000).  The  similitude  categories  indicate  the  level  of  
 
similarity between the observed climate and the projected climate for the region of interest (using 136  
 
global climate simulations). The analogues are based on a statistical comparison between the current and  
 
future distributions of mean annual temperature and total annual precipitation for the reference period  
 
 
1971-2000 and the horizon 2080 (2071-2100).
