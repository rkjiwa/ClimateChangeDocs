From the assessment 
framework…
“The first step in developing  
these forest impact scenarios ... 
is to select climate scenarios 
representing a range of plausible 
climate futures for the region of 
interest. Each climate scenario 
necessarily includes projections 
of selected climatic variables that 
affect forest ecosystems.”

—Williamson et al. (2012)

3.2  Develop and Describe Future Climate Scenarios

3.2.1     The Theory
Climate change scenarios are derived from climate models, which are in turn driven 
by projections of changes in atmospheric greenhouse gases (primarily carbon dioxide) 
resulting from alternative scenarios of future socioeconomic development. There are many 
plausible future climate scenarios because there are a number of different climate models 
and many possible scenarios of socioeconomic development. 

The resolution of most global climate models is too coarse for use in vulnerability 
assessments of SFM. Methods such as downscaling can be used to produce climate 
scenarios at a scale more useful for assessing SFM vulnerability. Price et al. (2011) 
presented a series of high-resolution interpolations of climate scenarios for Canada. Many 
regional climate centers (e.g., Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium, Ouranos) are excellent 
sources of climate information and scenarios. Additionally, Price and Isaac (2012) have 
presented a summary of scenario development processes for SFM. 

3.2.2     The Practice
The first step in developing scenarios is to decide on a small number of climate change 
scenarios (e.g., two to four) representing a range of plausible climate futures for your SFM 
system. There are several ways to create climate change scenarios for the SFM system:

 

•   Use “off-the-shelf” climate projections for the area encompassing the SFM unit, which 

are available from research centers such as the Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium 
and Ouranos. The Canadian Forest Service and some provincial and territorial forest 
services have significant resources available to project climate changes and impacts 
on forests (see the description of the Canadian Forest Service’s Forest Change 
initiative, in section 2.3.2). 

 

 

•   Involve analysts who can work with the available datasets of climate change 

projections to create information for the SFM area.

•   Include climate experts on the assessment project team to explore and expand on 

the available data. 

Efforts should be made to align the timeframes for reporting within the climate change 
scenarios with the timeframes for assessing SFM impacts. The following two approaches 
have been used in practice: 

 

 

(1) 

(2) 

 Assess a short-term and a long-term timeframe (e.g., 20 years, using the climate 
change results for the 2020s, and the end of the century, using results for the 
2080s).

 Assess at one midterm timeframe, often the 2050s (i.e., 2041–2070), which is 
consistent with the timescale used for reporting midrange climate change 
projection results.
