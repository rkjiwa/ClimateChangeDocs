As temperatures climb, cooling degree days increase. From a historical baseline  
of only 55 cooling degree-days annually in Metro Vancouver, projected 
increases range from at least double by the 2050s to as much as a factor of 
10 increase by the 2080s. Alternatives to vast application of air conditioning 
will need promotion in order to avoid adaptation that increases greenhouse 
gas emissions.
Summer day-time high temps: projected increases in summer day-time 
high temperatures indicate a summer climate by the 2050s between that  
of present-day Seattle and San diego.
frost free Period: Freeze-thaw can be hard on vegetation and infrastructure  
alike. the frost free period in the urban parts of the study area are already 
quite high with the majority of the year (roughly 200 days/year) frost free 
on average during the 1961-1990 period. projections indicate a new normal 
by the 2080s of virtually frost free conditions. 
fraser river hydrology: the portion of the Fraser contiguous with Vancouver  
is tidally dominated. nevertheless, changes in runoff timing and the seasonal  
distribution of runoff could have implications for water availability and habitat.  
By the 2050s winter and spring flows are projected to increase by 56% to 85%  
and 37% to 56% respectively and summer flow to decrease by 13% to 23% 
for the Fraser- Hope hydrometric station. the mean annual peak flow is 
projected to occur about 10 days earlier.13 

3.2.2 extremeS: 

the head of climate monitoring and attribution at the U.K’s Hadley centre for  
Climate Change, explains that for every 1 degree Celsius rise in temperature,  
the amount of moisture that the atmosphere can contain rises by 7% or more. 
“the upshot is that overall rainfall increases only 2% to 3% per degree of warming,  
where extreme rainfall increases 6% to 7%”.14 in basic terms, this is due to the  
large-scale energy balance of the planet. With extra moisture in the atmosphere, 
when precipitation does occur, it’s more likely to be in bigger events. 
Current observations support an increase in storm intensity. toronto recently  
initiated a program to improve storm drains after experiencing eight extreme  
storms (more than 1 in 25 year intensity) between 1986 and 2006. the 
insurance Bureau of Canada states that severe storm-related water damage 
has doubled since 1992 to 44% of claims.15

pCiC used eight regional Climate Models (rCMs) to project changes in extremes. 
the projected change from the 1971-2000 baseline period is projected for 
the 2050s (2041-2070) in all cases. in the case of warm days (table 3,  
first row), the ratio can be interpreted as warm days occurring 2.2 times  
as frequently by the 2050s.
extreme precipitation is projected to increase for all the precipitation indices.  
the percent of annual total precipitation that falls during events that are larger  
than the 95th percentile of events in the past is projected to increase by 
about 21% on average (table 3, row 2). percent of annual total precipitation 
falling during events larger than the 99th percentile of past events is projected  
to increase by 28% on average (table 3, row3).

baseline for all eight rCm runs and all months except for warm days which are 
given for summer and heaviest precipitation days indicated for September.

3.2.3 return PerioDS:

rCM projections were also used to provide an estimate of how return 
periods are expected to change by 2050. A return period (or recurrence 
interval) is an estimate of the interval of time between events (earthquakes, 
floods) of a certain intensity of size. the table below shows the ratio of 
future to past return periods. For example, the median value of 5.8 for the
