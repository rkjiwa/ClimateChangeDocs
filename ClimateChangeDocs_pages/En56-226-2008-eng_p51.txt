TABLE 4.   EXAMPLES OF ADAPTATION ACTIONS

WATER
SECTOR

FORESTRY,
FARMING AND
RANCHING

(cid:129) Demand and Supply Strategies: Introducing usage metres and market pricing
(cid:129) Developing and implementing education campaigns
(cid:129) Encouraging adoption of technological changes in water-consuming processes and devices (e.g.

low-flush toilets, water efficient taps and micro irrigation) 

(cid:129) Requiring introduction of water conservation measures and sustainable drainage systems for all

development projects

(cid:129) Planting xeriscaped gardens that incorporate plants selected for their water efficiency 
(cid:129) Establishing upland and lowland reservoirs, both natural and manmade, to ensure sufficient water

supplies during summer while reducing potential for downstream flooding during periods of
heavy rainfall

(cid:129) Reservoirs also provide important aesthetic, recreational, and ecological benefits
(cid:129) Managing point source pollution to reduce water quality risks
(cid:129)
(cid:129) Harvesting rainwater to reduce water demand, lower risk of flooding (i.e. harvesting water buffers

Increasing river basin planning and coordination, including capacity for inter-basin transfer

the amount of precipitation entering drainage systems), and collect water for toilet flushing, car
washing, irrigation, etc.

(cid:129) A 100m2 roof can catch 500L of water from a rainfall of just 5mm
(cid:129) Disinfecting treated wastewater through practices such as lagooning and micro-filtration so water

(cid:129) Developing checkdams (anicuts) to stop/slow down water runoff in gullies and facilitate

can be reused

groundwater recharge

(cid:129) Greywater recycling involves reusing water from sources such as baths, sinks and laundry for

other purposes, such as toilet flushing. Filtration and disinfection mechanisms must be in place.
These systems require maintenance over the long-term.

(cid:129) Reduce flooding events and minimize flooding impacts: Establishing and protecting green

infrastructure in urban areas, such as open spaces, woodlands, street trees, fields, parks, outdoor
sports facilities, community gardens, village greens, private gardens, and green or living roofs and
walls to attenuate peak flows and inhibit flash flooding

(cid:129) Using ‘cool’ or ‘porous pavements’ 
(cid:129) Preserving land that is required for current and future flood risk management
(cid:129) Providing financial compensation to farmers who provide ‘blue services’ by allowing their

agricultural land to be flooded 

(cid:129) Re-creating functional floodplains 
(cid:129)

Introducing participatory risk assessment as a part of long-term local and regional development
planning

(cid:129) Planning for increased frequency of extreme events to promote long-term resilience 

(cid:129) Apply urban forestry (i.e. creating parks, planting trees along streets, growing trees within

residential compounds) 

(cid:129) Encourage smaller farms engaged in lifestyle farming
(cid:129) Promote community gardens
(cid:129) Employ no-till agriculture to reduce erosion, water quality issues and release of methane from

soils
(cid:129)
Implement agro-forestry (i.e. incorporation of multi-purpose trees and leguminous species)
(cid:129) Conserve native forests as their characteristically high biodiversity levels and native species

contents afford them greater resilience to environmental conditions resulting from climate change 

(cid:129) Reuse greywater for agricultural and horticultural irrigation
(cid:129) Provide financial incentives/mechanisms for increasing resiliency, removing impediments, and

improving information systems (e.g. concessional credit lines to support agricultural equipment
purchases)

(cid:129) Assure market linkages and integration to strengthen response capacities and share risks
(cid:129) Fallow fields (i.e. leave agricultural fields to rest and accumulate moisture every other year)
(cid:129) Rotate crops
