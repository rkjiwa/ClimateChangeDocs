1.1-A.     Factors prompting the assessment 
Briefly describe factors in the categories listed in Table 1.1 that may have triggered your 
desire to initiate a vulnerability assessment: environmental or ecological (e.g., a recent 
extreme weather event; unprecedented forest disturbances), economic (e.g., demands 
from investors or insurance agencies to consider climate change), or social and cultural 
(e.g., market pressures to ensure sustainability under a changing climate). Examples of 
possible factors are provided in Appendix 2.
