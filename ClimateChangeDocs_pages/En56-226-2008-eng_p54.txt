(cid:129) Mitigate heat islands in order to reduce demand for air-conditioning and to extend the

habitability of structures during heat waves

(cid:129) Prioritize energy efficient strategies that act synergistically with climate change adaptations (e.g.

reduce rooftop ice damming with better insulation and increase fire-resistance and reduce
incidences of breakage from flying debris in windstorms with energy-efficient window systems)

(cid:129) Create and protect recreational green spaces to improve quality of life while concurrently

providing biodiversity, health, energy, flood storage, noise reduction, and air purification benefits

(cid:129) Protect critical environments and landscapes
(cid:129) Establish upland and lowland reservoirs, both natural and manmade, to provide not recreational,

(cid:129) Diversify tourism revenues that also increase local sustainability and provide low-carbon

flood management and biodiversity benefits

alternatives to conventional tourist activities

Adaptation responses that, if designed carefully, could
be SAM actions

The following list of adaption measures can contribute to the
reduction  of  GHGs  and  to  sustainable  development if

designed properly. For example, by selecting  environmentally
friendly  materials;  promoting  energy,  water  and  other
resource  conservation;  promoting  re-use  and  recycling;
minimizing  waste  generation;  protecting  habitat  and
addressing needs of marginalized groups.

(cid:129)

Introduce adaptation policies that compensate for any climate change losses that individuals may
experience in relation to basic needs

Incorporate infrastructure adaptation into the planning, maintenance and replacement cycles of
new and existing infrastructure (e.g. construction of the Confederation Bridge between New
Brunswick and Prince Edward Island was built 1m higher than required to accommodate sea level
rise over its hundred year lifespan)

(cid:129) Demolish and replace unsafe structures 
(cid:129) Relocate at risk communities
(cid:129) Avoid or regulate development in vulnerable locations
(cid:129) Prioritize and develop adaptation solutions such as retrofit technologies for the most critical

regions and most critical existing infrastructure types 

(cid:129) Review existing engineering practices in light of the changing climate
(cid:129) Address issues surrounding current infrastructure codes and standards, including 

(cid:129)   Enforcing compliance to codes and standards for new infrastructure 
(cid:129)   Updating safety factors in codes and standards to reflect increasing uncertainties and increased

variability or range of extremes in values and growing risks for new infrastructure under
changing climate conditions 

(cid:129)   Considering standards for maintenance practices to increase the reliability of structures over time

(cid:129) Apply a “diversified lifetime” approach to building construction
(cid:129) Design buildings for disassembly so their uses can easily change over time 
(cid:129) Ensure key long-term parts of buildings are able to cope with predicted climate change and

design short-term components for minimal climatic change but maximum flexibility

(cid:129) Manage access to and safety of roadways through snow clearance, sanding and salting in the winter
