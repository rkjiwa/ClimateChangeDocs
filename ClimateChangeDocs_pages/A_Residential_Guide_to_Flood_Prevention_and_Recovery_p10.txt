Overland Flooding
Historically, prior to the determination of regulatory flood plains 
by conservation authorities, some homes were built in areas 
along creeks and rivers which can be prone to flooding during 
extreme rainfall events.
During dry conditions or periods of light rain, water in creeks 
and rivers remains confined within the banks of the watercourse.  
During high flow conditions, caused by very heavy rain or rapid 
spring thaw, water may overtop the banks and swell in to the 
flood plain.  During extreme events, homes located within these 
areas may be subject to overland flooding.
During extreme conditions, overland flooding can also occur 
away from watercourses when the quantity of precipitation 
exceeds the capacity of the roadway and overflows onto 
private property.

Reduce the risk
If your home is located within a regulatory flood plain, contact 
your local conservation authority (Credit Valley Conservation, 
Toronto and Region Conservation Authority or Conservation 
Halton) to learn more about protecting your home from flooding.
