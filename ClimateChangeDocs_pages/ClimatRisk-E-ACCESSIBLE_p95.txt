The Public Infrastructure Engineering 
Vulnerability Committee (PIEVC) 
Engineering Protocol, led by Engineers 
Canada, was developed as a 5-step 
process to analyze the engineering 
vulnerability of individual infrastructure 
systems based on current climate and 
future climate projections (see Figure 12). 
Since 2012, the PIEVC Protocol has been 
applied to a wide variety of infrastructure 
types, including roads and airports.

The Coquihalla and Yellowhead highway 
assessments considered a very broad range 
of infrastructure components and climate 
parameters, including:

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

High and Low temperatures;

Freeze / Thaw cycles;

Frost / Frost Penetration;

 Rainfall - Total Annual; Extreme High; 
Sustained

Snow Frequency; Snow Storm / Blizzard;

 Rain on Snow; Hail / Sleet; Rain on Frozen 
Ground;

High Wind / Downburst;

 Rapid Snow Melt; Snow Driven Peak Flow 
Events (Freshet);

Ice / Ice Jams; and 

Ground Freezing.
