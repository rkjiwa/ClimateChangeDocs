wall and the trim into which the sof!t panels are inserted. A
homeowner can also apply a dollop of caulk in the V-shaped hole

Outdoor objects
Loose items can become a !re hazard when they accumulate near 
a home. They can also pose a signi!cant danger around a home if
picked up by high winds during a violent storm. Be sure to trim any
trees and shrubs around the home. Remove any dead or rotted trees,
branches, or bushes, as well as other debris from around the yard. 

Turn off propane tanks. Make sure all items in the yard (e.g., storage
sheds, lawn furniture, garbage cans and grills) are secure and heavy
enough to stay put under normal conditions. Never leave a patio
umbrella up when not in use as it can easily be picked up by the wind
and turned into a missile. Consider replacing gravel or rock
landscaping materials with shredded bark. Store vehicles in a garage 
or other enclosure. 

Moor boats securely. If the boat is ashore on a jack stand, strap the
boat down where possible. If there is a pool on the property, cover 
the pump !lter.
