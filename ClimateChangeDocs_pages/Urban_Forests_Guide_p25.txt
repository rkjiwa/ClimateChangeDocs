Chiswick Business Park in London, England 
includes a large area of open spaces that 
is designed to help regulate outdoor 
temperatures. It is designed to be comfortable 
for users now and as the climate changes 
over the next 40–60 years. This sets it apart 
from competing business parks that will 
be “unpleasant places to work in without 
significant air conditioning”. 31 

flows). The exposed soil directly surrounding a 
tree (or root zone) has a higher infiltration rate 
than compacted soil, because roots loosen the 
soil and increase water penetration. Third, the 
root systems deeply penetrate the soils, allowing 
for more groundwater infiltration. This means 
that there will be more groundwater available to 
supply streams during summer drought periods.
Figure 10 shows how under natural forested 
conditions, about 90% of the rainfall is either 
returned to the atmosphere via evapo-

transpiration or enters and moves through 
the ground as interflow. The rest recharges 
groundwater aquifers, and less than 1% becomes 
overland runoff. As urbanization occurs and 
there are more impervious surfaces and fewer 
trees, much more goes to overland runoff. 
Planting significant numbers of trees and shrubs, 
particularly in clusters or groves, can help to 
reverse these effects. 

Increase the Canopy Cover 
Increasing canopy cover (leaf area) allows for 
greatest interception of rainfall. Large mature 
trees provide the greatest benefit, since they 
have the most surface area to retain water.

•	 Plant and retain large-canopy trees. The 

amount of rainwater a tree detains depends 
largely on its size. Large, broad-leafed or 
coniferous trees intercept far more water 
than smaller ornamental species. 

•	 Consider using more coniferous tree 

species, where appropriate. Unlike
