Local governments have many options to protect biodiversity and promote conserva-
tion within their jurisdictions, such as park and greenbelt planning; parkland acquisition; 
protection  of  watercourses,  streamside  areas  and  wetlands;  coastal  planning;  urban 
forest  management;  and  the  designation  of  urban  containment  boundaries.  Local 
governments can adopt policies to protect biodiversity and sensitive habitats in their 
OCPs, through the use of Environmental DPAs, zoning, by requiring impact assessments 
for applications for rezoning and development permits, and using bylaw powers related 
to landscaping, tree protection, soil removal and deposit, watercourse protection, alien 
invasive species and pesticide use. A key resource for these measures is the Green Bylaws 
Toolkit. www.greenbylaws.ca

Urbanization has been identified as one of the top contributors to habitat loss and eco-
system degradation affecting species in BC, and climate change will add a further stress. 
Taking Nature’s Pulse, Section 3: Threats to Biodiversity in BC.36 Urban areas may face serious 
consequences related to climate change, some of which include more invasive species, 
loss of urban and park trees, problems with waste water treatment dealing with new 
types of microorganisms, and public health risks associated with diseases transmitted by 
immigrating species like mosquitoes.37 

Local governments can do their part to help species adapt by reducing existing stresses 
related  to  pollution  and  habitat  loss,  by  restricting  or  prohibiting  land  uses  that  may 
contribute to pollution, and expanding conservation and restoration efforts in sensitive 
areas. Maintaining parks and greenbelts can have multiple climate change adaptation 
benefits, providing habitat and connectivity, stormwater and floodplain management, 
infiltration and drainage, and opportunities for public education around climate change.
