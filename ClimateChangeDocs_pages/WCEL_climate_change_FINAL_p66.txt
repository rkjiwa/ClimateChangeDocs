To consider:

•	 Green infrastructure for stormwater management is a network of engineered and natural 
features that aims to mimic the natural hydrologic cycle and increase onsite capture and 
infiltration, through measures such as topsoil requirements, rain gardens, permeable 
pavement, landscaping, green roofs and others — as contrasted with “grey infrastructure,” 
pipes and drains that remove rainwater from sites and send it directly to watercourses and 
treatment plants. Green infrastructure may offer more climate resilient options for local 
governments and communities, and green infrastructure specifications can be incorporated 
into land use planning and regulation of new developments and areas being re-developed.

•	

Local engineers and planners need to use design values and information that account for a 
changing climate so that they avoid building infrastructure to suit historical conditions that 
will be vulnerable to future realities. Sources to consult for more information include:

In some cases local governments may be lacking the local information needed to adequately 
assess the vulnerability of infrastructure to climate change, and so the first measures 
undertaken will involve research and data collection related to existing infrastructure.

•	

In Castlegar, for example, action items include monitoring flows in its stormwater 
system, and obtaining downscaled information about relevant future climate 
impacts from the Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium. www.cbt.org/uploads/pdf/

In Saanich the local government will work with Environment Canada, BC 
Environment, and the Capital Regional District to review the adequacy of 
precipitation monitoring in the district. www.saanich.ca/living/climate/pdf/

Relatively low cost adaptation measures for infrastructure include actions such as analyses of 
infrastructure failures; regular infrastructure maintenance; community disaster management 
planning; updating climatic design values and engineering codes and standards; and 
improving the quality and length of climate data records. Auld, H. and D. MacIver. Cities and 
Communities: The Changing Climate and Increasing Vulnerability of Infrastructure. Occasional

•	 Mainstreaming climate change adaptation into design, maintenance and restoration 

of infrastructure will require more, and better communication between climate change 
researchers, policy makers, engineers, architects, operators and asset managers. This will 
include both information sharing and education. Adapting Infrastructure to Climate Change 
in Canada’s Cities and Communities. Research & Analysis Division, Infrastructure Canada, 
December 2006. http://ipcc-wg2.gov/njlite_download.php?id=6305

Local governments may 
be lacking the local 
information needed 
to adequately assess 
the vulnerability of 
infrastructure to climate 
change, and so the first 
measures undertaken 
will involve research 
and data collection.
