extremeS

a.  Measures 90th percentile temperatures relative to each day of the summer (June-Aug.)

projected future changes and historical climatology of extremes are provided for five indices that are a subset of the standard set of indices of extremes 
called CLiMdeX32.
  1.  Warm days - tX90p: occurrence of summer maximum temperature > 90p 
 
  2.  Very wet day precipitation - r95ptot: annual total precipitation when > 95p
  3.  extremely wet day precipitation - r99ptot: annual total precipitation when > 99p
 
  4.  Heaviest precipitation day - rX1day: annual average of monthly maximum 1-day precipitation.
  5.  Heaviest 5-day precipitation - rX5day: annual average of monthly maximum consecutive 5-day precipitation
 

a.  Measures the maximum precipitation during a single day or 5 consecutive day period. each month is computed separately and the annual average  

a. Measures amount of rain when daily precipitation exceeds the 95th (r95ptot) and 99th percentile of all rain days. 

 

 

 

of all months is reported.
