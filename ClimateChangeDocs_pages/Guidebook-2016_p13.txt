Brunswick and Nova Scotia for the winter months (DJF, December, January, and February) for the horizon  
2080 (2071-2100) in comparison to a 1971-2000 reference period. The changes are shown for an  
ensemble of global climate simulations under RPC4.5 (n = 100, blue points) and RCP8.5 (n = 60, red  
points). The associated distributions of each set of simulations are shown on the left and bottom panels.

future values for this index for the horizons 2050 (2046-2065) and 2090 (2081-2100), calculated using an  
ensemble of 79 simulations (75 from CMIP3 and 4 from CRCM4). The middle columns represent the  
median, while the left and right columns represent the 10th and 90th percentiles of the ensemble,  
respectively.

Figure 21 |  Spatial analogue for the greater Toronto area for the 2080 horizon (2071-2100). A. The regions where  
 
the recent climate (1971-2000) is similar to the climate projected for the greater Toronto area in 2080  
(2071-2100). B. The regions where the projected future climate (2071- 2100) is similar to that of the  
 
greater Toronto area for the recent past (1971-2000). The similitude categories indicate the level of  
 
similarity between the observed climate and the projected climate for the region of interest (using 136  
 
 
global climate simulations). The analogues are based on a statistical comparison between the current and  
future distributions of mean annual temperature and total annual precipitation for the reference period  
 
 
1971-2000 and the horizon 2080 (2071-2100).

region. The values are calculated using an ensemble of 79 simulations (75 from CMIP3 and 4 from  
CRCM4), while the observations come from an NRCan dataset44,45. Shown are the observed values (black
