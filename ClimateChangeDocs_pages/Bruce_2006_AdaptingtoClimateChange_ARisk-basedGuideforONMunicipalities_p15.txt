•  Additional stakeholder analysis completed 
•  Stakeholder communications initiated 
•  Risk information library is started and rules 

for document collection are established;  
Important reference material is documented 
and stored 

• 

•  Outline of risk communications plan has 

been completed. 

Decision 
There are three decision options (see the 
decision diamond in Figure 2 on page 4: End, 
Go back or Next step/Take action.  
•  End the process if the hazard(s) and risk(s) 

are Considered by stakeholders to be 
acceptable. 

•  Go back to Step 1 or the beginning of Step 

2 if the risk management team considers 
that it is necessary to improve on any aspect 
of the information developed in those steps 
or to make any changes, if appropriate.  
Given the nature of the climate change 
issue, it is not unusual to have to improve 
data collection and revisit assumptions in 
order to enhance the credibility of the entire 
risk management process. 
If the risk situation continues to be a 
concern, proceed to the Next Step, Step 3 
Risk Estimation.

Checklist 
Preliminary analysis 
Have you: 
 

1.  Developed risk scenarios and 

completed a preliminary analysis of 
their probabilities and 
consequences? 

 

2.  Established a baseline of data for 

each of the risk scenarios? 

3.  Developed a stakeholder database? 
4.  Refined your stakeholder analysis? 
5.  Updated the risk information library? 

 
 
 
 
Example 
EXTREME WEATHER EVENT DURING A 
LONG HEAT-WAVE (continued from Step 1) As 
discussed in the example in Step 1, Council has 
asked for an opinion as to whether the 
municipality could cope with this type of multiple 
emergency event especially when staff are 

 

already heavily committed because if the long 
heat wave. 
Possible Hazards.  Long extended hot weather 
in high 30C, smog, extreme storm cells, strained 
or overloaded health and emergencies systems, 
extreme rainfall.   
 
Possible Risks. 
•  Community facilities overloaded and unable 

to cope with demand 

•  Emergency system overburdened and 

cannot respond 

•  Safety of personnel, vehicles at risk 
•  Mould 
•  Flooding 
•  Sewer back-up 
•  Heat stress, respiratory problems and other 

health impacts 

•  Property damage 
Preliminary Analysis of Risk Scenarios. 
•  Extreme rainfall and extreme amounts of 
water runoff in short time - wash down of 
paved area – pollution 

•  Localized violent flooding 
•  Sewer back-up 
•  Road and rail washouts  
•  Underpasses blocked and/or flooded 
•  Vehicles stalled blocking main arteries  - 

emergency vehicles unable to reach medical 
emergencies, injured people 

•  Electrical outages  
•  Stores closed 
•  Bank machines stop – no money available 
•  No gasoline available 
•  Health issues related to sewer back-up 
•  Food security 
•  People dependent on system for survival 
Establish Baseline. 
•  Hospitals already crowded 
•  EMS already overworked 
•  Power systems already overloaded 
•  Verify historical data on all elements 
•  Policing for looting, traffic control, security 
•  Storm ponds nearly full 
•  Storm water system (infrastructure) 

compromised because of age 

•  Temperatures – number of very hot days
