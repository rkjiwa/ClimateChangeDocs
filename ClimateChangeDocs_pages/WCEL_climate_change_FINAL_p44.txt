flood plain regulation

Flood plain designation is a way to help reduce the risk of flooding for any new develop-
ment or re-development. Local governments will want to consider how a changing climate 
might impact any designated flood plains, whether any revisions to the area designated 
are called for, and whether any new areas should now be designated as flood plains.

“Sea level rise planning areas” have been proposed as a potential tool to deal with coastal 
areas affected by future sea level rise associated with climate change. The boundaries of 
these areas would be revised periodically over time as sea levels rose. Local governments 
could use tools such as OCPs, zoning and DPAs to regulate setbacks and the types of de-
velopment that would be allowed within sea level rise planning areas.27 

Examples:

•	

•	

The City of Vancouver is proactively encouraging a 1m increase in flood 
construction levels in flood prone areas in the interim while updating flood 
proofing policies. The interim measure is to incorporate sea level rise projected 
for 2100 and is in response to the Climate Change Adaptation Guidelines for Sea 
Dikes and Coastal Flood Hazard Land Use released in May 2011 by the Ministry 
of Environment. www.env.gov.bc.ca/wsd/public_safety/flood/pdfs_word/
sea_dike_guidelines.pdf

The City of Prince George updated its flood plain bylaw in 2010 as part of a 
broader strategy to manage flood hazards developed after the 2007-2008 
Nechako River ice jam and flood event. http://princegeorge.ca/environment/

To consider:

•	 Watersheds where forests have been devastated by mountain pine beetle may 

be subject to increased flooding risks downstream.28

•	

For planning purposes in coastal areas, provincial guidelines regarding sea level 
rise are currently 1m by 2100 and 2m by 2200. See www.env.gov.bc.ca/wsd/

FLOOd PLAIN REGuLATION

Local Government Act, s. 910

Local governments have the exclusive power within their jurisdictions to designate flood 
plains, after considering guidelines established by the Minister of the Environment (see www.
env.gov.bc.ca/wsd/public_safety/flood/pdfs_word/sea_dike_guidelines.pdf). Within the flood 
plain area the local government can specify the flood level and setback required for buildings. 
Requirements can vary for different locations within the floodplain and according to the type of 
structure and use.
