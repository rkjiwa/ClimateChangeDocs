APPENDIX 2

If the impacts are sea level rise,
climate variability and extremes,
this will challenge energy
production, transportation and
associated infrastructure and
economic activity

The consequences could be issues such as:
(cid:129) Changes in water availability could be positive in the winter as supply increases

but negative in the summer when a reduced water supply coincides with
increases in energy demand for residential cooling and other competing uses.
On the other hand, demand for heating in the winter has decreased in Western
Canada.

(cid:129) Transportation and associated infrastructure such as port facilities could be

affected in many ways. Milder winter conditions could improve air and ground
travel, but more frequent storms could have the opposite effect. Sea level rise is
of particular importance for communities expanding along their coastlines, as a
rising water table may reduce the bearing capacity of roads. Interruptions to
energy and transportation services can have large associated costs for the
economy, as witnessed during the 2003 power outage in northeastern North
America.

These consequences could lead to potential vulnerability at the local level as
follows:
(cid:129) Hydropower production is sensitive to total runoff, the timing of runoff, and

to reservoir levels 

(cid:129) Under projected temperature increases, hydroelectric supply will improve in

winter, but face challenges in summer due to conflict with instream flow
targets and salmon restoration goals (e.g. under the Endangered Species Act) 
In western Canada, there has been a significant decrease in the number of days
requiring space heating and an increase in the number of days requiring space
cooling, with resultant implications on total energy demand 

(cid:129)

(cid:129) Warmer and less snowy winters may reduce delays, improve ground and air
transportation reliability and reduce road maintenance demands. However,
more storms could increase risks 

(cid:129) Declining fog trend in some parts of North America could be good for

transportation. Higher potential flood levels and more frequent flooding at
levels rarely experienced today is projected with very high confidence 
(cid:129) More frequent flooding and landslides would impact transportation 
(cid:129) Heat spells could cause increasing damage to railroad tracks and roads, with

(cid:129)

implications for future road design, construction and management 
Sea level rise and an increase in extreme storm events has implications for
ports, airports, railways, roads, highways, and inland navigation 

(cid:129) Higher ground water levels in low lying areas may reduce bearing capacity or

roads requiring rebuild or increased load restrictions
