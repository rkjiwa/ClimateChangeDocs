severity; Early warning systems based upon weather predictions of flooding, landslides, 
river flooding and coastal flooding; Flood evacuation plans, especially for nursing homes, 
hospitals, schools; Proper design and siting of health infrastructure; Assessment of the 
resiliency of health care facilities to climate change; Education of health risks and appropriate 
behaviours by physicians; Mapping of high risk populations with 100- and 500-year flood 
zones; Post-flood disease surveillance; Use of automated devices in cars to warn of water 
depth, landslide early detection systems; Disaster mental health services that is sensitive 
to socioeconomic status, livelihood patterns, local traditions, cultures and languages; and, 
Immediate family reunion and support (for families that have been separated)
Increased mold and respiratory contaminants from mold, bacteria, fungal growth on damp 
structures, such as: Inspection of heating, ventilating and air conditioning system (HVAC) 
by a professional after a flood; and, Drying out homes using fans or dehumidifiers when 
safe to do so

• 

•  Zoonoses and vector-borne diseases, such as: Spread of vector-borne and zoonotic diseases, 

including exotic diseases; Development of new surveillance methods; Dissemination of 
information for public health officials and the public; and, Tools for risk-based decision making 
on management (i.e. surveillance, prevention and control) of emerging/re-emerging zoonoses/
VBDs (e.g. Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis), prioritization of zoonoses/VBDs for public health 
action, and weather-based forecasting of West Nile Virus

•  Food and water quality, such as: Increased water contamination and water-borne diseases, 

contamination of food; Protocols for chemical and contaminant risk management; 
Monitoring of harmful algae bloom outbreaks; Boil water advisories; Expanding water 
reuse systems to offset reduced supply, increased demand, or both; Improving or 
expanding water treatment regimes; Adopting alternative energy sources at treatment 
plants (e.g. diversifying power sources, adding energy-efficient water pumps); Establishing 
collaborative management regimes with power suppliers; and, Abandoning or enhancing 
water infrastructure at risk
