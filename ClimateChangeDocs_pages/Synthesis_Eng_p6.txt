CANADA’S CLIMATE IS CHANGING, WITH OBSERVED CHANGES IN AIR 
TEMPERATURE, PRECIPITATION, SNOW AND ICE COVER AND OTHER INDICATORS. 
FURTHER CHANGES IN CLIMATE ARE INEVITABLE (CHAPTER 2). 

Over the last six decades, Canada has become warmer, with average temperatures over land increasing by 1.5°C 
between 1950 and 2010 (Figure 1). This rate of warming is about double the global average reported over the same 
time period by Hartmann et al., (2013). Warming has been occurring even faster in many areas of northern Canada, 
and has been observed in all seasons, although the greatest warming has occurred in winter and spring. The annual 
number of extreme warm days has also risen, while the number of cold nights has declined. Table 1 provides 
examples of documented changes in Canada for a variety of indicators of the physical climate system.

FIGURE 1:    Patterns of change in annual mean temperature across Canada over the period1950–2010. Upward (red) and 

downward (blue) pointing triangles indicate positive and negative trends respectively. Filled triangles correspond 
to trends significant at the 5% level (Source: Vincent et al., 2012). Inset: Annual mean temperature change for 
Canada (°C), 1950–2010, relative to the 1961–1990 average (represented by zero on the Y-axis) (Source: Vincent  
et al., 2012; Environment Canada, 2011).
