1.2-E.     Key nonclimatic factors currently affecting your SFM system
List any factors that are currently affecting your ability to achieve your SFM objectives (e.g., 
markets, shortage of workers, changes in land use, lack of data). These factors may affect 
your SFM system into the future and will need to be considered, along with any climate 
change impacts, during the vulnerability assessment. Identifying these factors now will 
help when developing future scenarios later in the process (section 7.3).

Table 1.9.     Key nonclimatic factors currently affecting your SFM system

Factor

Effect on achieving SFM objectives

Example: other land-use activities

Example: reduced productive forested 
area within forest management area

Additional effects of climate 
change on this factor in relation to 
achieving SFM objectives

Example: potential for increased fire 
and forest pest outbreaks may further 
reduce timber supply, adding to the 
net loss of productive forest area
