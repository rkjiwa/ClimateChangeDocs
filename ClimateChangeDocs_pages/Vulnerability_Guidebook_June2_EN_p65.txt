Case Study – Capabilities 
approach to identifying 
adaptation options

Alberta’s Climate Change Adaptation Framework Manual (ESRD 2010) uses a capabilities 
approach to identify adaptation options. The premise behind this approach is that an 
organization’s capabilities for adaptation depend on options in four critical areas, each of 
which should be considered when developing a list of potential adaptation options:

•   Governance – These options address management, policies, and processes to direct 

the organization’s activities and cover policy, resource decisions, and facilitation of cross-
organization relationships.

•   People – These options improve the capacity and capabilities of individuals within 

the organization and also look beyond the organization to external stakeholders 
through training, recruitment and retention strategies, updated job descriptions, and 
performance management.

•   Technology – These options involve the application of science for adaptation to the 

environment, such as climate modeling software, geographic information systems, field 
equipment, monitoring equipment, and infrastructure.

•   Process – These options address how work is done within the organization. Processes 

for climate change adaptation include developing and deploying strategies, identifying 
and assessing risks, responding to risks, designing and testing measures, monitoring and 
re-evaluating progress, and continuous improvement.

The field of forest management adaptation is rapidly evolving, and this inventory of 
adaptation options should therefore not be considered definitive or comprehensive; 
rather, it should be revised and updated as new knowledge is gained or as innovative 
ideas are proposed. The inventory of potential adaptation options and the worksheets 
associated with this step are categorized according to relevant CCFM SFM criteria.   

In addition to these suggestions and any that have been collected during the vulnerability 
assessment process, the assessment team should also explicitly consider options to 
strengthen adaptive capacity to achieve each of the SFM objectives. The team should 
revisit the adaptive capacity assessment (Worksheet 4.2. Evaluate adaptive capacity 
of the SFM system) and identify adaptive capacity deficits that are specific to achieving 
individual SFM objectives. For example, a knowledge deficit that can be filled by ongoing 
support from a climate specialist through analysis of future extreme rainfall to understand 
potential impacts on soil erosion could be recorded as an adaptation option under 
your SFM objective related to maintaining soil productivity. Referring back to the key 
uncertainties and knowledge gaps identified throughout the vulnerability assessment 
process (Worksheet 2.4. Identify uncertainties and knowledge gaps) can also be a 
great starting point for generating adaptation options.

Worksheet 5.1 (Develop potential adaptation options for SFM objectives) involves 
identifying all potential adaptation options for your SFM system of interest. At this stage, 
adaptation options should not be evaluated; rather, efforts should be directed toward 
identifying all possible options.
