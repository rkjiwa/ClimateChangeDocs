1. Taking action on your own
Seal cracks in foundation walls and basement !oors
Sealing cracks is a simple way to help reduce basement "ooding in
your home. In many cases, cracks can be effectively sealed from inside.
Most of the time, you should not have to dig anywhere beside the
foundation to repair them. 

Downspout extension

Disconnect your downspouts, add extensions and splash pads
Downspouts are designed to
convey water from eavestroughs
and down the side of the
house. Downspouts often direct
water to the surface of the lot,
but in many cases they may be
connected to the weeping tile
or the sanitary sewer lateral.

be directed at least

surfaces including driveways or walkways.

FOOTING

•  Talk to your municipal government before you do this.

COARSE GRAVEL

WEEPING TILE

When connected to the municipal sanitary sewer system, eavestrough
downspouts can contribute a
substantial amount of water to
these systems. Because of the
environmental impacts resulting
from combined sewer
over!ows and the increase in
basement "ooding risk that
connected eavestroughs cause, it
is illegal to connect downspouts
to municipal sewer systems in
many Canadian communities.

If your downspout looks similar to these, chances
are it is connected to your weeping tile or the municipal
sanitary sewer system and should be changed.
