5.  CUMULATIVE DISTRIBUTION FUNCTION

Figure 25 |  Cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the regional mean annual number of growing degree-days for the  
reference period (1971-2000) and two future horizons (2050 and 2090) for the Greater Slave Lake region. The  
 
values are calculated using an ensemble of 79 simulations (75 from CMIP3 and 4 from CRCM4), while the  
 
observations come from an NRCan dataset44,45. Shown are the observed values (black curve) and projected  
 
values for the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles of the ensemble of climate scenarios (green, blue and red  
 
 
curves).
