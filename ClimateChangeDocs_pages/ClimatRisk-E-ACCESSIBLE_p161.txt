3.2 CLIMATE PROJECTIONS

Ontario’s climate is projected to change in all three sub-regions, with some variations. Projected 
changes in annual and seasonal precipitation and temperature for the province as a whole are 
shown in Table 2. Figures 5a-b and 6a-b capture sub-regional variation, presenting a gradient of 
possible changes for the years 2016-2035, 2046-2065, and 2081-2100, in relation to a baseline period of 
1986-2005.
