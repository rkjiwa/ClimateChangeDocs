REGIONAL CLIMATE RISKS 

While there is considerable variation in Canada’s climate, transportation systems across the nation 
share many of the same climate risks; practitioners can therefore learn from each other’s experiences.  
Risks common to all regions include extreme weather events (particularly heavy precipitation) 
and extreme and fluctuating temperatures. Extreme events have affected communities across 
the country, including large urban centres, costing billions in disaster-related losses. Provinces and 
territories with marine coasts face common risks associated with storm surge flooding, sea-level 
changes, and coastal erosion. Canada’s northern regions, including the three territories and the 
northern parts of several provinces, all face risks associated with thawing permafrost. 

Examples of past impacts to each region’s transportation system from climate change and extreme 
events are depicted in Figure 1. These impacts are characteristic of many, though not all, of the future 
risks these regions face.
