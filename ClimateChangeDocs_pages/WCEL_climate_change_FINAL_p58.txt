Potential indirect impacts of increased hazards also need to be considered.

The District of Kimberley is looking at the need to plan for alternative drinking water 
sources in the event of wildfires in local watersheds. www.cbt.org/uploads/pdf/

The interaction of multiple climate events and other types of hazards needs to be assessed:

Prince George has identified a need to investigate the future impacts on river flood 
flows as a result of the pine beetle infestation, climate change and Nechako Reservoir 
regulation. http://princegeorge.ca/infocentre/communications/Lists/Recent%20

Increased precipitation from storms can lead to greater run-off in rivers, and be 
combined with storm surges from coastal waters to produce more serious flooding in 
some coastal areas.

In Saanich a Hazard, Risk and Vulnerability Analysis concluded that the District was 
reasonably well-equipped to respond to a single event, but if two emergencies 
occurred simultaneously, such as a heat wave and an earthquake, emergency 
response could be compromised. Both Saanich and Prince George recommended 
regional emergency response initiatives with increased resources for training and 
action as a possible solution to limited local capacity. www.saanich.ca/living/climate/

The City of Vancouver is looking at improving cross-departmental responses 
to emergencies. For example, if the engineering department already has heavy 
equipment out in the City for regular operations and an emergency arises, it may be 
possible to coordinate use of the equipment to move fallen trees and other debris 
from storms.31

Citizen education can play an important role in emergency prevention and response.

•	 Many local governments already have an emergency preparedness guide for 
the community; this can be updated along with the emergency management 
plan. Halifax Regional Municipality has a citizen guide that specifically looks at 
preparing for climate change-related risks. www.halifax.ca/climate/documents/

The BC Forest Service — Protection Branch has developed a FireSmart manual for 
homeowners. www.pssg.gov.bc.ca/firecom/pdf/homeowner-firesmart.pdf

•	

Cooperation with other levels of government and responsible agencies will be important, 
particularly for regional scale emergencies.

The District of Saanich climate change adaptation strategy proposes working 
with the Ministry of Health, the Capital Regional District and other municipalities 
to address extreme heat weather events through a health monitoring alert and 
response system. www.saanich.ca/living/climate/pdf/saanich_adaptation_plan_
