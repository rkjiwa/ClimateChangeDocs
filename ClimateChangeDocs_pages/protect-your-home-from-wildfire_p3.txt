Wild!res

Fire is a natural process essential to maintain healthy forests. Wildland
!res can also be a terrifying peril that threatens lives and property.

Wild!res burn on average 20,000 km2 of forest each year in Canada.
When these !res approach our communities they can force families 
to evacuate. In !ghting these !res, !re!ghters are sometimes called
upon to make decisions on which properties can be defended and
which cannot. 

Over the last several centuries, large
parts of Canada have burned
repeatedly. 50 per cent of Canada’s
wild!res are caused by people.
Most of the other half is caused by
lightning strikes on dry forest. This
is why the risk of wild!res is highest
in the summer.

If you live in or near a forested area,
you’re living in an area often
referred to as the wildland/urban
interface and sooner or later you
may have to contend with a wild!re. The risk of wild!res is increasing
in many parts of Canada and your best protection against loss,
damage or injury is prevention. 

ICLR has partnered with the Government of Alberta to distribute the
FireSmart Home Owners Manual. This material details the speci!c
actions that Canadians should take in order to protect their homes
from wild!res.
