Most buildings and infrastructure have a lifespan much longer than the 20-30 year future time period 
often used when designing infrastructure and planning communities. Planning for a century of change is 
a challenge, but is a realistic goal given the implications of projected sea level rise. Figure 2 (below) shows 
the effect of incremental increases in minimum building elevation planning over time, based on a 100 year 
lifespan for a structure.

Regardless of the time frame used, observations and predictions of sea level rise will need to be periodically 
re-evaluated. Predictions of sea level rise will continue to evolve and be refined as the science progresses 
and more data becomes available.
Vulnerability and Adaptation
The impact of sea level rise on Canada’s coastal zones depends largely on the vulnerability of coastal 
communities.  A community’s vulnerability is a function of its exposure and sensitivity to a hazard or 
environmental change and its adaptive capacity or resilience. Adaptive capacity is a function of local context 
and refers to a community’s ability to adapt to potential impacts, as well as cope with specific events, based 
on its social, economic and institutional resources.12 Vulnerability can therefore be lowered by adaptation 
measures which reduce exposure to (or risk from) a hazard or by increasing resilience.13 

Some of Canada’s greatest vulnerabilities to climate change lie in coastal areas, which are home to 
concentrated populations, economic centres and valuable ecosystems.14 Although Canada has a vast 
coastline, the inhabited coastal area represents only 2.6% of the total land area. In 2001, 38.3% of the 
Canadian population lived within 20 kilometres (km) of a marine or Great Lakes shoreline. Of this total, 
approximately 4.9 million people, or 23%, lived on the Pacific coast, and 20% lived on the Atlantic coast.15 

By 2015, it is estimated that a majority of Canadians (50.7%) will be living within 20 km of the coast or the 
Great Lakes, with the greatest concentration of people living within 5 km of a shoreline.16

A proactive approach to sea level rise adaptation is more cost effective and less disruptive than a reactive 
approach. Adaptation should ideally aim to create resilient communities through a triple bottom line 
approach that (1) minimizes the unplanned loss of land and physical capital such as infrastructure;
