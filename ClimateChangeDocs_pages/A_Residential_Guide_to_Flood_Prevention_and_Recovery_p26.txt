bundled in maximum two-by-four foot lengths.

Items NOT accepted as regular waste and 
bulk waste
The following items are not accepted as regular waste.  
Please visit peelregion.ca/waste for proper disposal:
• Electronics 
• Household hazardous waste, e.g. solvents, garden chemicals, 

home cleaning products

• Metal and appliances
Mould
Mould can grow on wet surfaces in as little as 48 hours and  
any growth over time indicates a continuing moisture problem. 
If you begin to notice mould growth anywhere in your home 
after the flood, it is important to remove the source of moisture 
and clean the affected area.
Exposure to mould does not always have negative health 
effects, but some individuals may be more sensitive or 
vulnerable to exposures

Getting rid of mould
The size of the affected area will determine whether you should 
clean and remediate the area yourself or hire a professional:
Yourself: small areas no more than one square metre.
Professional: large areas greater than one square metre.
