Similarly to the intermediate category, the climate information in this last category is focused on projected 
future climate changes. However, the analysis targets not only average or mean changes in a climate variable 
over time but also estimates changes in extreme events and for climate indices for which there is less 
confidence in model projections at this time.
The information given to users in this category is often tailored specifically to their needs and will often not 
be relevant or usable by others. 
The examples used to highlight the type of information available in this category have been grouped into four 
examples. From the simplest to the most complex, they are:

 › Temporal series – used to provide outputs from climate models for impacts models

• Hydrology

 ›

Intensity-Duration-Frequency curves – used to analyze extreme precipitation events

 › Analysis of low-confidence climate indices and events

• Climate model scenarios
• Synthetic scenarios
