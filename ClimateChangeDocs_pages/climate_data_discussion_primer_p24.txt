refer to mitigation activities in response to a vulnerability assessment and the scientist can 
perceive this to mean a broadening of the scope to include greenhouse gas management issues 
relative to the contemplated actions. 
 
What the average engineer considers to be mitigation would normally be called adaptation in the 
climate change literature.  The parties can alleviate this by discussing and agreeing to the 
definitions that they will be using during the execution of the assessment and by revisiting these 
definitions if, and when, confusion arises. 
 
3.18  Normalize

The engineer may use the term normalize in a 
very general or non-technical fashion.  They 
may use normalize in the sense of aligning 
measured and reference data points, in the 
same sense that they may refer to calibration or 
the scientist may refer to validation.

The scientist may use the term normalize in the 
sense of statistical data management techniques 
aimed at reducing the error associated with a 
data set.  They may also refer to processes that 
are used to align different sets of data to a 
common mean and variance.  The latter is 
similar to the approaches that may be applied 
to grade results from a class to align those 
results with a pre-defined mark distribution.

The engineer may ask for information to be normalized when they are actually asking the 
scientist to validate the model outputs.  The scientist may perceive this to be a request to 
complete a variety of statistical operations on the information with the aim of reducing variances 
or adjusting data sets to pre-defined variance ranges and mean values.  The scientist may not be 
able to actually do the tasks that they perceive the engineer to be requesting.  In fact, the engineer 
may actually be asking the scientist to provide information on validation of the model outputs, an 
activity that the scientist may have completed already as part of their routine analysis. 
 
3.19  Parameter

Typically, the engineer may refer to design 
parameters.  Generally, they would use the 
term to cover fixed design threshold values.  
Less commonly, they may refer to a parameter 
as a variable in a computation.

The term can have broad range of 
interpretations in climate science.  It can 
include something that is measure (eg., 
precipitation) and thus can be very close to the 
engineering concept.  On the other hand, it can 
also include constants in climate models that 
are adjusted to change model behaviour and to
