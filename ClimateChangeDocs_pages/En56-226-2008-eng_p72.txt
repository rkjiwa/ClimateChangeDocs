APPENDIX 2

If the impacts are changes to
precipitation type, timing,
intensity and frequency;
together with temperature
changes these will impact the 
availability and quality of the
water supply

The consequences could be issues such as:
(cid:129) Water demand is increasing due to population growth and development.

However, shrinking glaciers, earlier snowmelts and a decreasing snowpack will
mean that less water is available in the summer and fall when there is high
demand for hydroelectric power and local uses. Increased demand for surface
water will in turn place pressure on limited groundwater supplies that are also
at risk of salinization as sea level rises. As well, increasing water temperature,
water-borne diseases, forest fires and landslides are a growing concern and can
impact water quality.

These consequences could lead to potential vulnerability at the local level as
follows:
(cid:129) An increasing proportion of precipitation falls as rain rather than snow 
(cid:129) Earlier melting and a significantly decreasing snowpack contribute to increases
in winter and early spring flows while summer flows may decrease substantially
In the short term, melting glaciers may add to streamflow in spring; in the
long term, this will probably mean less runoff, especially in summer 
Increased water stress regionally and greater competition between agricultural,
industrial and ecological uses across the continent 

(cid:129) Ground water levels will rise as sea level rises, adding costs for water pumping

(cid:129)

(cid:129)

and resulting in salt water intrusion into some wells and aquifers  

(cid:129) More frequent landslides, forest fire contaminants as well as warmer

(cid:129)

temperatures could impact water quality 
Surface and bottom water temperatures of lakes, reservoirs, rivers and estuaries
in North America will likely increase (projection of 2 to 7ºC under doubling
of CO2)

(cid:129) Water quality impacts could occur due to a longer erosion season and

enhanced erosion in agricultural areas

If the impacts are changes in
amount and timing of
precipitation, sea level rise and
extreme weather; these will
stress water, storm and sewer
infrastructure

The consequences could be issues such as:
(cid:129) The amount and timing of precipitation poses clear challenges for the capacity

and functioning of stormwater infrastructure and the sewer system,
particularly in urban contexts with low permeability (e.g. paved surfaces). At
the same time, sea level rise could raise the water table and result in the
floating of sewers and foundations if they are not designed to deal with this.

These consequences could lead to potential vulnerability at the local level as
follows:
(cid:129)

Increases in heavy precipitation with expanding impervious surfaces (e.g.
asphalt) could increase urban flood risk and pose design challenges and costs
for stormwater management 

(cid:129) Potential issues with reservoir capacity and operations, water supply, storm and

sanitary sewer size, sewer flow during periods of summer drought and sewer
outfall as sea level rises  

(cid:129) There is no urgent need to upgrade infrastructure capacity; however, adding

higher capacity by additional actions or upgrading the infrastructure  as part of
the regular maintenance cycle would be prudent 

(cid:129) Rise in water table may also cause floating of sewers, foundations, etc that were

not designed for those conditions 

(cid:129) Continual upgrades of water and sewage systems will be necessary, and

additional energy may be required for pumping
