From the assessment 
framework…
“Once a suite of potential 
adaptations has been identified, 
the next step is to assess them 
and select those that have  
the greatest potential benefit  
for SFM or that offer the  
greatest promise in terms of 
achieving SFM (however it is 
defined for the management 
system of interest), given the 
realities of climate change.”

Identify Important Options for Achieving SFM

5.3.1     The Theory
Once a suite of potential adaptation options has been identified, the next step is to 
assess and select those adaptations that have the greatest benefits for SFM or that offer 
the greatest promise in terms of achieving SFM objectives. It is essential to focus on the 
importance of implementing adaptation options at this stage in the adaptation process 
and not on the feasibility of implementing the adaptations. Assessing feasibility and 
ecological and social suitability will be addressed in chapter 6.

Options that support achievement of SFM objectives across the range of possible future 
scenarios are known as “robust” options. Other categories of important options are “no-
regret,” “win–win,” and “must-do” options. No-regret options make sense today and for 
all potential futures. For example, increasing awareness of climate change and climate 
change impacts within your organization is likely to be a no-regret option, and very 
little will be lost if the projected climate change and impacts do not materialize. Win–
win options are those that can reduce vulnerability to climate change while improving 
or positively affecting other priorities. For example, the use of assisted migration to 
incorporate new tree species may present the opportunity to use tree species that are 
more productive, which could (hypothetically) lead to increased carbon capture. Must-do 
options are those that ought to be  undertaken immediately to achieve SFM objectives 
under current climate conditions and regardless of projected future climates. 

5.3.2     The Practice
Guidance for completing the option assessment steps in Worksheet 5.1 (Develop 
potential adaptation options for SFM objectives) and Worksheet 5.2 (Develop 
potential adaptation options for the overall SFM system of interest) is provided 
below.

Importance of implementing adaption option to achieve management objectives 
– A good starting point for climate change adaptation in the forest sector is to proactively 
identify management policies and practices with a higher likelihood of achieving SFM 
objectives across a wide range of potential climate futures (see “Case study – Southwest 
Yukon”). Considering climate change vulnerabilities, how important (or beneficial) is it to 
implement each of the adaptation options to achieve management objectives in your 
area? Perform this assessment both for current climate conditions and for each of the 
scenarios you have described. 

“Important” adaptation options – Determine which adaptation options can be 
considered robust, no-regret, win–win, and/or must-do (i.e., options that are important to 
implement across all scenarios to achieve management objectives in your area and thus 
most beneficial for SFM). In identifying these “important” adaptation options, look for any 
that are considered by a diverse group of practitioners or stakeholders as important to
