Taking action on your own

These initiatives cannot guarantee the safety and security of any home
but, if addressed, will help to minimize tornado and severe wind damage.

Storm-proof the roof
Tornado damage is usually most signi!cant for a home’s roof. Strong
winds generate uplift as they divide and "ow around a structure. The
wind stream following the longest path (usually over the roof) speeds
up to rejoin the stream following the shorter distance (usually around
the walls). According to
Bernoulli's principle, as the
wind speeds up across the
roof the pressure drops. This
generates uplift. The roof, in
effect, acts somewhat like a
wing and attempts to “take
off” from the remainder of
the building. 

Roof sheathing must be securely fastened to prevent
wind damage.

If the roof is old or showing
signs of damage or decay, 
re-roo!ng can signi!cantly
strengthen a home against
strong winds. The roof cover
should be removed down 
to the sheathing. Sheathing
should be checked for 
any damage and replaced 
as needed. 

Choose a high-wind rated
roof cover and make sure
ridge and off-ridge vents are
also rated for high winds. If a
homeowner is not ready to
re-roof, check vents to be
sure they will stay in place and are of the proper type and strength to
resist high winds and wind-driven rain. Shutter any vents before a
storm strikes or replace them with products rated for resistance to

High winds are a major cause of roof damage.
