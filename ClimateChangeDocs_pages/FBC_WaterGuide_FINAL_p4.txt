1. About this Guide

Water is the lifeblood of British Columbia.  
We depend on it, we value it, and with growing 
awareness of the potential impacts of population 
growth, climate change and other pressures on our 
water resources and watersheds, we must plan in 
order to effectively manage and steward our water 
resources long into the future. 

Water enables the ecosystems, cultures and communities of 
British Columbia to survive, thrive and flourish. The future of 
species, ecosystems, communities, regions, provinces and future 
generations will undoubtedly be influenced, in large part, by how we 
manage this precious resource. 

This guide has been developed for local governments, First Nations, 
and other government agencies, stewardship organizations, water 
use sectors and community stakeholders. The purpose of the guide 
is to help these organizations and individuals:

 ▪ Navigate through the web of current and emerging water issues;

processes that are available to communities in bc
