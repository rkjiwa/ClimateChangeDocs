 F Have processes for monitoring and assessing the adaptation strategy outlined in the OCP 

been put in place?

 F How and when will progress on climate change adaptation be measured and reported?

Land use and zoning

 F Has the community engaged in a climate change assessment process that has decided 

community priorities for action? If not, could this process be linked to OCP updates, zoning 
bylaw updates, applications and other land use activities?

 F Where are the high, medium and low risk areas in relation to a changing climate (e.g. valley 
bottoms, steep slopes, areas near rivers, coastlines subject to sea level rise, areas near dams, 
high hazard fire risk areas, etc.)?

 F In areas where wildfire risks currently exist, have risks been re-evaluated to account for 

climate change impacts (such as, potentially, reduced precipitation and a longer dry 
season)? See UBCMâ€™s Strategic Wildfire Prevention Initiative for funding opportunities: 
www.ubcm.ca/EN/main/funding/community-safety/strategic-wildfire-prevention.html14

 F Are there specific types of land uses that may be at risk? (e.g. areas subject to hazardous 

conditions that may become more severe or widespread as a result of climate change, 
environmentally sensitive areas, etc.)

 F Are there risks based on socio-economic factors, income levels, density and specific 

location (e.g. sea level rise planning areas)?

 F How will land uses change over time (e.g. increased use of parks during hotter periods and 

more demand for shade)?

 F How will building uses change over time (e.g. increased need for cooling centres at 

recreational facilities or community halls)?

 F Are there locations with equipment, tools or facilities that will be helpful or essential during 
an emergency event (e.g. public works yards and equipment, trucking/car rentals, refueling 
stations, private businesses, schools, churches, community centres, provincial /federal 
facilities, etc.)?

14  In Kimberley historical fire strikes were plotted on a computer visualization (a map) based on local knowledge 
and historical records. This was combined with the climate projections from Plan2Adapt, expertise from CALP 
and local knowledge about fire behaviour to estimate future risks. See www.planningforclimatechange.ca/
