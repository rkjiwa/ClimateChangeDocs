Note: In both tables 3.1 and 3.2 the measurements are expressed in comparative terms (“very 
unlikely” to “virtually certain” and “very low” to “very severe”).  It is also possible to express these in 
numerical values so that adding or multiplying them gives a quantified relative frequency or impact 
consequence.  The problem with using numerical values is that the reader may perceive them to imply 
more accuracy than actually exists.  The risk management team should consider the method to be 
used to compare relative frequency and impact or consequence values and agree on the most 
appropriate way of assigning relative values.  

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(6)  Consult with stakeholders and refine the 

 

 

stakeholder analysis 
(cid:131)  Engage stakeholders in a meaningful 
dialogue in order to communicate the 
risk estimates and to clarify their issues 
and concerns.  Consider using focus 
groups, workshops or public meetings. 
(cid:131)  Communicate information openly and in 

language and detail that stakeholders 
can understand. Provide information on 
the risk baseline (i.e. the risk frequency 
and consequences that exist now), 
methods for developing the risk 
scenarios and for estimating frequencies 
and consequences, assumptions, third 
party analyses and any other relevant 
information. 

(cid:131)  Some stakeholders may not agree with 

the frequency or consequence 
estimates.  Record stakeholders’ 
different views.  Later in the process, 
return to this step, if necessary, to test 
and discuss the sensitivities of the 
proposed adaptation measures to these 
different views of frequency or 
consequences.  

(cid:131)  Stakeholders’ issues and concerns will 
probably change as they become more 
familiar with the risk scenarios and the 
risk management process.  Document 
these changes on an ongoing basis. 

Expected results and outputs 
•  Estimates of frequency and consequences 
of risk scenarios, and estimate of expected 
consequences of each scenario 

•  Frequency and consequence estimates 

presented in a format that is easy-to-
understand by non-experts 

•  Estimates of the acceptance by 

stakeholders of risk, or a record of reasons 
for non-acceptance, based on a dialogue 
with the stakeholders and a careful 
documentation of their perception of the 
risks. 
Decision 
•  End the process if the estimated risks are 
much lower than initially estimated in the 
preliminary analysis, and stakeholders agree 
that there is no longer a significant concern. 

•  Go back if: 

(cid:131)  There is new information that needs to 

(cid:131)  Additional risk scenarios need to be 

be considered; 

considered; 

(cid:131)  There are doubts about data quality or 

analytical methods; or  

(cid:131)  Not all stakeholders are comfortable 

with the level of uncertainty associated 
with the analysis. 

•  Proceed to the next step if the risk 

management team and stakeholders are
