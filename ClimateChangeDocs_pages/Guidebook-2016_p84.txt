3.  ANALYSIS OF LIMITED CONFIDENCE VARIABLES – THE CHOICE BETWEEN 
SYNTHETIC SCENARIOS OR CLIMATE MODEL SCENARIOS

There are numerous climatic indices and climate events requested by decision-makers (Table 7) for which 
the confidence in the climate information that can be provided is limited. Different causes are responsible for 
this lower confidence. First, the resolution of models may not allow the model to ‘see’ the phenomena (e.g. 
convective storms); second, the physics behind the phenomena may not be fully understood (e.g. sea ice); 
third, the inclusion of the equations that represent the phenomena into a climate model may increase the 
cost of running the simulation by a factor that renders this inclusion prohibitive (e.g. ice storms); fourth, for 
some indices and events, there is very little available observed data, which prevents an adequate evaluation 
of the performance of models (e.g. soil moisture); and finally, the information for some indices and events 
may be available but not at a resolution that suits the needs of users (e.g. atmospheric pressure).
