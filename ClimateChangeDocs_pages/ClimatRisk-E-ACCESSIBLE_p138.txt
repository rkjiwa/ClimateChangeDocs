Figure 9a shows weekly rail transit times for trains going from British Columbia ports to Toronto. Two 
pronounced spikes in transit time are apparent. The first corresponds to a rail labour strike in 2012, while the 
second corresponds to the extreme cold winter of 2013-14.

Figure 9b illustrates a critical measure related to lower train speeds, higher dwell times and more re-crews 
- the number of “centralized traffic control” (CTC) outages. These outages mean that normal centralized 
dispatch systems are down, requiring slower train movements and positioning until the system is normalized. 
The bar graph shows the significant increase in CTC outages in 2013-2014, creating systemic vulnerability.
