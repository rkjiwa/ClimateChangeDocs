Foundation Flooding and Stormwater Sewer Backup
Foundation flooding can occur when heavy 
rainfall or significant melting snow is trapped 
around the foundation of your home and  
seeps in through cracks or window wells.  
If your roof downspouts are connected to  
your stormwater lateral connection 
underground, in heavy rain, this can  
cause a back-up around your foundation  
that can increase the chance of flooding. 

Stormwater sewer backups or surcharges  
can be caused by blockages or extreme  
rainfall events. This can cause the foundation 
weeping tiles to backup and water to seep  
into the basement. In severe cases, stormwater 
can build up on the road and backup towards 
the home.

Reduce the risk
• Improve lot grading, making sure that the 

ground slopes away from your exterior walls.
• Maintain all original property swales to divert 

water away from your home.

• Where possible, disconnect your roof 

downspouts and divert the stormwater at  
least 2 meters (6ft) away from your home  
to a vegetated, safe discharge point away  
from adjacent property lines, sidewalks,  
or building foundations.

• Check for and reduce leaks in walls, floors  

and windows or foundation.

• Ensure that gardens next to your basement 
walls do not create dams that retain water  
next to the house.

• Clean leaves and other debris from  
eaves troughs and downspouts to  
ensure proper drainage.

• In winter, shovel ice and snow at least  

2 meters (6ft) away from basement walls.
