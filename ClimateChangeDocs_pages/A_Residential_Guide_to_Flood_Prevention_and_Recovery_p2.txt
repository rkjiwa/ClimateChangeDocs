Dear resident:

Emergencies, such as flooding, can happen at any time.  
Every resident contributes to the overall ability of the City to 
bounce back quickly after an emergency, by being prepared. 
Our goal is to provide you with information on the most 
probable hazards and risks you may face, so that you can 
plan ahead, be ready and be able to protect yourself, your 
family, your home and your property.
In order to help you prepare for an emergency, we are 
providing this resource for you to keep and read before and 
in the event of an emergency: A Residential Guide to Flood 
Prevention and Recovery. Youâ€™ll find important information 
about planning ahead, preventing damage to your home, 
checklists and local emergency contact numbers.
In the event of an emergency, we will update our website  
and coordinate communications with local radio and television 
outlets. For additional updates during an emergency,  
please sign up to follow us on Twitter @citymississauga.
If you have any questions or would like additional copies 
of these materials, please visit mississauga.ca. We are 
committed to working together with you to keep the  
City of Mississauga a great and safe place to live.

Sincerely,

Bonnie Crombie, Mayor of Mississauga
