Climate change adaptation is a rapidly evolving area of practice. Literature and practical guidance continue to be published with new 
and innovative approaches and tools. This ‘living’ guide will be revised as new approaches are developed and tested in Ontario and 
other jurisdictions.  Any questions or comments concerning the guide can be directed to Jenny Gleeson (jenny.gleeson@ontario.ca). 
An evaluation form to provide comments on the framework is also available to inform future versions of the guide.
