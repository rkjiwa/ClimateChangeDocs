This chapter involved an extensive review of both scholarly and grey (non-peer reviewed) literature, 
as well as interviews with transportation practitioners across the province. The findings and discussion 
reflect the current state of knowledge on climate adaptation in Ontario; however, they should not be 
considered an exhaustive inventory of experiences, impacts, and adaptations.

1.1 GEOGRAPHY

SOUTHERN SUB-REGION

Ontario’s southern sub-region extends from Canada’s southernmost location (Point Pelee) east to the 
Quebec border. The topography ranges from flat in the southwest and southeast to rugged and hilly 
in the Niagara escarpment region (Chiotti and Lavender, 2008). It contains eight of Canada’s 16 most 
densely-populated metropolitan centres, including the urban regions of the Greater Golden Horseshoe 
(centered around the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area), and the City of Ottawa in the east. This 
sub-region features significant landscape modification for transportation networks, urban development, 
and agriculture.  Southwestern Ontario has a temperate, humid climate, with warm summers and 
cold winters. For communities in this area, the Great Lakes have a moderating effect on temperature, 
influence patterns of atmospheric convection (and therefore precipitation distribution and intensity) 
during the summer, and produce a “snowbelt” effect in the winter (Baldwin et al, 2011; Gula and Peltier, 
2012). Southeastern Ontario is characterized by relatively longer winters and shorter summers than in the 
southwest, although annual precipitation levels are comparable (Baldwin et al, 2011).
