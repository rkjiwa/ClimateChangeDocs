This flood hazard mapping project collected elevation data 
for 13 Yukon communities to better understand where 
flood hazards might be affected by climate change.

2016 

Identified challenges and barriers to agriculture, adaptive 
measures and best management practices. Modelled areas 
prone to change in Dawson, Central Yukon, Haines Junction, 
and Whitehorse/Southern Lakes agricultural regions
