Case Study – National 
area: National Forest Pest 
Strategy

The provinces, territories, and federal government agreed to collaborate on developing 
the National Forest Pest Strategy (NFPS), which would enable forest managers across the 
country to manage forest pests in a more proactive, integrated way through more efficient 
use of knowledge and technology. In 2007, forest managers and scientists tested the risk 
assessment approach of the NFPS on a real-world question: Would the mountain pine beetle 
outbreak, already spreading beyond British Columbia, present a threat to Canada’s boreal and 
eastern pine forests? Combining biological evidence, climate change trends, and computer 
simulations, the researchers concluded that the beetle does pose a real risk to the boreal 
forest. This assessment has led to calls for attempts to slow the beetle’s spread eastward, to 
give resource industries and governments time to address the susceptibility of their forests.

Biophysical Elements of the SFM Area
The natural biophysical elements of SFM vulnerability assessments most often focus on 
forested ecosystems. A detailed description of forest ecosystems and their existing natural 
drivers of change (e.g., fire dynamics, forest pest dynamics) is a useful starting point for a 
vulnerability assessment. Nonforested ecosystems (e.g., wetlands, grasslands) may also be 
included, as climate change is likely to affect these ecosystems and may influence SFM 
practices and adaptation options. 

Human Elements of the SFM System
SFM systems include a variety of human elements (e.g. individuals, organizations, 
governance structures, institutions) that influence how decisions are made and 
implemented. It is essential to account for these human elements in an SFM vulnerability 
assessment. For example, it may be useful to consider individuals, agencies, organizations, 
or governments with the following characteristics:

 

 

 

 

 

•  involved in overall land management or partnered in the management of the area

•  involved in reviewing or approving plans or in regulatory compliance or enforcement

•  holding land-use tenures

•   in a position to affect decisions for the area

•   in a position to be affected by decisions for the area.

Individuals within the SFM system will include personnel from these organizations, 
including managers and professional and operational staff, as well as individuals who are 
not affiliated with any particular organization but who are interested in the area for other 
values, such as recreation users and the general public.
