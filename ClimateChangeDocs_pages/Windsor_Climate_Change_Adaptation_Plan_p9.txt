Climate Change Adaptation Plan  2012 

 
provides the ability for municipalities to undertake regional modelling on climate change.  The Localizer 
Reports developed by the CCCSN uses an “ensemble” approach, which means that numerous models 
are used to determine projections rather than basing projections on just one model. Comparisons with 
past climate models show that ensemble projections are usually more realistic than any single modelvii. 

Throughout the City of Windsor’s adaptation planning process, two climate change scenarios were 
examined: the high (A2) and the low (B1) emissions scenarios. Each scenario projection is completed as 
an ensemble of over 20 different global climate models. However, it has been noted that the highest 
emissions scenario (A2) is closest to the observed trends with recent data showing climate change is 
advancing more quickly than previously estimated.   

 The following table shows the average annual temperature projections above the baseline period 
(1971-2000) based on the two scenarios. Projections to 2050 are often the most reliable as model 
results begin to diverge after 2050. 

Table 1: Average Annual Temperature Projections for Windsor. 

Year 

2020 
2050 
2080 

B1 Scenario 
(Low Emissions) 
 1.3 ± 0.3 °C 
2.0 ± 0.5 °C 
2.6 ± 0.6 °C 

A2 Scenario 
(High Emissions) 
1.2 ± 0.3 °C 
2.6 ± 0.5 °C 
4.4 ± 1.0 °C 

Though the average projection increase may be perceived as a minor change, it actually can have a 
significant impact on the region.  As figure 4 below indicates a slight increase in the mean average 
temperatures will lead to more ‘hot’ and record ‘hot’ weather with less cold weather.  This shift in the 
average weather for the region allows for the survival of invasive species, the expansion or introduction 
of insect vectors that carry disease, increase in ‘heat alert’ days and increase evaporation of surface 
waters that contribute to an increase of extreme precipitation events.
