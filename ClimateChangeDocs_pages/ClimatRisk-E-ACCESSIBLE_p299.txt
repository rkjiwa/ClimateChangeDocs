•  Bridge scour 

• 

Storm surges 
during extreme 
weather 
events

Storm-surge flooding (inundation 
of coastal roads, bridges, 
highways, bike paths, and

Increasing 
average daily 
wind speed/
more frequent 
extreme wind 
events

•  Overloading of stormwater 
management infrastructure
Increased maintenance on tall 
structures (e.g., power lines and 
signals)

• 

•  Malfunction and damage to 

traffic control signals

•  Unsafe working conditions due to 

flying debris

Impacts on urban roads, bridges,

Storm-surge flooding (inundation of 
coastal railways)
Embankment erosion/washout

• 
•  Overloading of stormwater 
management infrastructure

•  Railcar blow-over due to high-speed 

cross-winds

•  Utility disruption (e.g., power loss)
•  Obstruction and increased 

maintenance due to falling debris 
(e.g., fallen power lines, trees, 
branches)

•  Blocked culverts (e.g., trees and

signalization equipment

debris)

•  Closure of/damage to bridges
•  Roadway, sidewalk, and bike 

path obstruction caused by debris 
(e.g., fallen power lines, trees, 
branches)

•  Utility and communication 

disruption due to loss of power

•  Damage to elevated walkways/

bike paths

•  Reduced cycling activity during 

More frequent 
wildfire events

• 

high winds
Inaccessible/congested 
community access and 
evacuation points

•  No examples found in the literature
