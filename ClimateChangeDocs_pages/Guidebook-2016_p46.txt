It is important to remember that post-processing 
techniques (see section 1.10) are often used to re-
move some of the bias in climate simulations in 
order  to  better  match  simulation  values  to  true 

observed  values.  However,  the  match  is  never 
perfect  and  so  climate  scenarios  should  still  be 
calculated using simulated past and future values, 
even if simulations have been bias corrected.
