PRECIPITATION

Projected changes in precipitation in Canada, include an increase in British Columbia and Atlantic 
Canada, as well as changes to the seasonal distribution of precipitation across the country (Bush 
et al., 2014). Precipitation is expected to increase in all seasons across most of Canada, with the 
exception of a summer decline in the southwest (Bush et al., 2014). Figure 11 shows changes in 
precipitation patterns in Canada over the last 59 years.
