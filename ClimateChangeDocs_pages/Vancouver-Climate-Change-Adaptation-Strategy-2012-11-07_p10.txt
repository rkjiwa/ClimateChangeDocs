in order to measure Vancouver’s adaptive capacity, impacts were assessed 
based on the cost and amount of staff intervention that would be needed 
to adapt. engineering was most frequently identified as having low adaptive 
capacity; a direct reflection of how built infrastructure is generally unable to 
accommodate major changes in climate without additional costs and potentially 
significant disruptions. 
given sensitivity and adaptive capacity, vulnerability is ranked as follows.

likelihood 
to determine the likelihood, Vancouver characterized the impact as a single 
event (windstorm) or a recurring event (increasing annual rainfall). A likelihood  
rating from 1 to 5 was then assigned where 1 is “rare” and 5 is “almost certain”.
Consequence 
the second step of a risk assessment is to evaluate the consequence of an  
impact. Using a relatively common risk assessment matrix, Vancouver looked  
at how the impacts would affect five areas: public safety, local economy and 
growth, community and lifestyle, environment and sustainability, and public 
administration. Matrix ratings ranged from 1 (negligible) to 5 (catastrophic). 
the sum of all the consequence values was then totalled to give the impact 
an overall consequence rating. 
Consequence and likelihood are then multiplied to obtain a risk rating on the 
following scale.

risk is a function of the likelihood and consequence of an impact where  
likelihood refers to the probability of the projected impact occurring, and 
consequence refers to the known or estimated effects (economic, ecological,  
social or legal) of a particular impact. 

risk =

likelihood x Consequence

Workshops were held with staff across the organization to brainstorm actions  
to prepare for, or reduce risks from, the prioritized impacts. Workshop  
participants then reviewed a consolidated list of potential actions before  
the working group evaluated them. Criteria from the Canadian Communities’ 
guidebook for Adaptation to Climate Change were used to rank the actions. 
the criteria and ranking descriptions are listed in table 1. 
Actions with low scores were discussed and most often discarded. others were  
ranked into the following categories: “must do”, “monitor” or “investigate 
further”. Must do actions are those that have a high benefit to cost ratio 
and those with a short time horizon until impacts are likely to be observed. 
in consultation with staff, must do actions were further prioritized by date 
of the capital planning cycle they will be implemented by. Actions that are
