Examples of each of these adaptation approaches are identified below (Table 6) based on chapter 
findings. This list provides concrete examples of adaptation actions being implemented across 
Canada.   

Table 6: Examples of adaptation approaches identified in this report.

Adaptation Activities

Organizational planning, policies and designs

The BC Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure requires infrastructure design 
work to consider climate change adaptation, and has developed a set of 
notional best-practices. 
TransLink, Vancouver’s regional transportation authority, has integrated 
responsibility for climate change risks into its financial management processes.
Port Saint John’s long-term port modernization plans are accounting for sea 
level rise.
Jurisdictions, such as the City of Sept-Îles are using zoning requirements to control 
coastal land use and are undertaking cost-benefit analysis for threatened 
structures. 
Several jurisdictions are updating design flows and return periods for stormwater 
management networks, including culverts, to account for an increased frequency 
and/or magnitude of heavy precipitation events in the future.

Structural and physical (engineering) adaptations

The New Brunswick Department of Transportation rebuilt and raised a bridge 
on the main road into Pointe-du-Chêne to accommodate future sea level rise 
scenarios.
The Quebec Ministry of Transportation has oversized the diameter of culverts by 
10% to help manage heavy precipitation events.
Norman Wells Airport and Ottawa International Airport have grooved their 
runways to improve traction and drainage during heavy precipitation.
Transportation practitioners are implementing and testing engineering techniques, 
such as thermosyphons, to reduce permafrost thaw under infrastructure, and are 
using fiber optic technologies to monitor permafrost degradation.
Roads in Ontario are using the “SuperPave” system to determine optimal 
pavement mixtures for local temperature conditions.
GO Train engineers are increasing the preferred rail-laying and rail-distressing 
temperatures for track, in order to reduce buckling risks to rail lines from high 
temperatures.

The Greater Toronto Airport Authority (GTAA), the BC Ministry of Transportation 
and Infrastructure, municipalities, and others have used the Public Infrastructure 
Engineering Vulnerability Committee’s (PIEVC) Engineering Protocol to assess 
transportation infrastructure (see Box).
Marine transportation companies have conducted winter-operation risk 
assessments and ship-specific winterization procedures to reduce risks posed by 
changing ice conditions in Arctic waters.
Railway companies are undertaking vulnerability assessments and GIS mapping of 
areas at risk from landslides, washouts, and other natural hazards.
