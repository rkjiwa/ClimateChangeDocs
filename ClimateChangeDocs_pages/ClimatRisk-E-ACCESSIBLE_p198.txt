Figure 1:  Map of principle transportation infrastructure in Quebec.

The Quebec-Ontario Continental Gateway and Trade Corridor initiative was undertaken jointly by the 
Quebec, Ontario and Canadian governments in 2007. It aimed to create an integrated multimodal 
transportation system that was reliable, sustainable and competitive to support international trade. In 
this respect, the St. Lawrence valley can be considered the main corridor in Quebec’s transportation 
infrastructure network, and provides for much of the exchange between Quebec and its main 
economic partners. It includes the major urban hubs of Montréal and Québec City. Figure 2 illustrates 
this intermodality across Quebec.
