2.  INTENSITY-DURATION-FREQUENCY CURVES (ANALYSIS OF EXTREMES) 

Figure 27 |  Intensity-Duration-Frequency curves for the St-Lawrence valley simulated for the present (aet) and future  
(aeu) climate by the CRCM driven by a global climate model CGCM #4. The lines indicate the intensity for  
 
 
events with four different fixed frequency return intervals (2, 5, 10, and 25 years).
