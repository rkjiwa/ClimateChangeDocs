Throughout  the  process,  it  is  important  to  communicate  findings  to  key  organizations,  staff,  and  decision-makers  so  that  they  are 
aware  of  the  potential  climate  impact  within  their  spheres  of  influence  and  responsibility.  Action  will  be  required  by  government 
agencies, industry, communities and organizations. Engaging these groups early in the process will help build support for adaptation 
planning and implementation.  

At this stage, the team can develop impact statements of vulnerability and risk to communicate findings to key organizations. Teams 
can elect to host a workshop to present findings of the vulnerability and risk assessment. Alternatively, teams may decide to briefing 
notes to communicate findings. Both options can also be used to communicate with stakeholders and at other stages in the process 
to ensure transparency.
