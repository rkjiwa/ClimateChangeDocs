2.2 RAIL TRANSPORTATION

Rail transportation makes a significant contribution to freight movement in the Prairies. Three Class-I 
railways3 (Canadian National - CN, Canadian Pacific - CP, and Burlington Northern and Santa 
Fe - BNSF) carry the vast majority of regional rail freight. Most tracks are located in areas without 
permafrost. One exception is the rail line connecting Churchill, Manitoba with supply-chain hubs to 
the south (Figure 2).

Although the operational length of Canada’s rail network has declined in recent years, the Prairies 
have resisted this trend. As of 2012, the regional network had retained 94 percent of its 2008 length 
(Railway Association of Canada, 2015). In 2013:

•  Alberta had 6,679 km, used by CN, CP, Great Sandhills Railway, Alberta Prairie Railway Excursions, 

Great Canadian Railtour Company, and VIA; 

•  Saskatchewan had 8,181 km, used by CN, CP, Carlton Trail, Great Western, Great Sandhills 

Railway, and VIA; and 

•  Manitoba operated 4,448 km, used by CN, CP, BNSF, Central Manitoba, Hudson Bay, and VIA. 

In all three provinces, freight comprises approximately 98 percent of track usage (based upon fuel 
consumption), with passenger traffic accounting for the remainder. In 2009, 39 million tonnes of rail 
freight originated in Alberta, 27 million tonnes in Saskatchewan, and 10.6 million tonnes in Manitoba 
(Railway Association of Canada, 2015).

In 2013, three of Canada’s top-ten freight-rail border crossings were located in the Prairies: Warroad, 
Minnesota-Sprague, Manitoba; Portal, North Dakota-North Portal, Saskatchewan; and Pembina, North 
Dakota-Emerson, Manitoba (Transport Canada, 2014).

2.3 AVIATION

Aviation is also an important mode of transport in the Prairies. There are five National Airport System 
airports in the region (serving Calgary, Edmonton, Saskatoon, Regina, and Winnipeg), which 
accounted for 22 percent (28.7 million) of Canada’s total enplaned/deplaned passengers in 2014 
(Transport Canada, 2015). Arrivals/departures at these airports accounted for 78 percent of the 
region’s passenger movements in 2014. 

Air freight is often chosen for higher-value shipments; therefore, air freight tends to account for a 
larger share of freight by value than by weight compared to other modes. Accounting for all inbound 
and outbound shipments in 2014 (both domestic and international), Manitoba moved 65,873 tonnes, 
Saskatchewan handled 12,077 tonnes, and Alberta accounted for 113,933 tonnes (Statistics Canada, 
2014b). Principal airports in Manitoba are shown in Figure 2. 

2.4 MARINE TRANSPORTATION

A review of marine transportation in the Prairies is essentially a review of the Port of Churchill in 
Manitoba (the Prairies’ only access to tidewater). Opened in 1931, the Port is an artery to northern 
Manitoba and the central Arctic region (Government of Manitoba, 2015a). In 2016, the private owner 
of the port, OmniTRAX, announced the closure of the port for grain shipments, due to the limited 
volume of grain moving through the port. Currently the port remains open, supporting resupply to 
communities located in Nunavut.
