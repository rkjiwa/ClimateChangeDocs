again in support of mainstreaming. As a last resort, a separate monitoring and evaluation 
plan could be developed that outlines resource requirements, roles of contributing 
organizations, and individual responsibilities and milestones for monitoring SFM indicators 
and implementation of adaptation actions. 

Case Study – Review of SFM 
indicators for climate change

Steenberg et al. (2013) have assessed the potential impacts of climate change on the 
existing CCFM criteria and indicators and made recommendations for maintaining, 
adjusting, or removing individual indicators. They also made recommendations for new 
indicators.

Use Worksheet 6.4 (Evaluate adaptation performance) to describe how you plan to

Keep it simple. Your list of indicators should be kept to a realistic, practical number. When 
formulating your monitoring plan, consider the human and financial resources that 
are available for monitoring, and prioritize the list of indicators to those that are most 
meaningful for reporting on implementation progress and trends toward achieving SFM 
objectives. 

In the face of uncertainty, forest managers should take an approach that emphasizes ongoing 
learning, whereby management adaptations are treated to some extent as “experiments,” and 
new information collected through monitoring is evaluated to determine next steps. Adaptive 
management recognizes the lack of knowledge about ecosystem function and climate 
change and integrates continual learning. 

Monitoring and evaluation should go hand in hand. Monitoring alone is useless if the 
information it generates is not analyzed in a formal evaluation process. By quantitatively or 
qualitatively describing status and trends over time, indicators provide the basis for before-
and-after analyses.

Regardless of how monitoring and evaluation are accomplished—by mainstreaming into 
existing activities, by adding these important steps to ongoing activities, or by creating 
separate implementation and monitoring/evaluation plans—the roles and responsibilities 
for these tasks must be clear, with defined reporting timelines. Including everyone who is 
involved in implementing adaptations in the monitoring and evaluation phase will expedite 
adaptation, promote continuous learning throughout partner organizations, and produce 
more realistic refinements to adaptations when needed. 

Monitoring provides the information needed to improve plans and take timely corrective 
action. Success depends on a long-term commitment to integrate monitoring and 
evaluation into ongoing operations, both during implementation and over the lifespan 
of the adaptations. The selection of indicators for monitoring and the frequency of 
monitoring may evolve over time. You might also consider coordinating indicators and their 
measurement with other organizations and undertaking appropriate research initiatives to 
maximize the value of the information collected.
