4.0  CASE  STUDY:  THE  LAKE   SIMCOE  VULNERABILITY   ASSESSMENT  AND 
ADAPTATION STRATEGY  

 

 

Background 

The  Government  of  Ontario  appointed  the  Expert  Panel  on 
Climate  Change  Adaptation  in  2007  with  a  mandate  to 
evaluate  current  government  programs  and  recommend  a 
path  forward.  The  panel  released  its  report  in  2009  with  59 
recommendations 
including  recommendation  #34,  which 
states that the “climate change adaptation strategy called for 
in the Lake Simcoe Protection Plan should be considered as 
a  pilot  project  with  potential  application  to  strategies  for 
increasing the climate resilience of other watersheds” (Expert 
Panel  on  Climate  Change  Adaptation,  2009).  The  Lake 
Simcoe  Protection  Plan  also  contains  a  dedicated  climate 
change  policy  that  commits  the  Ministry  of  the  Environment, 
in collaboration with Ministry of Natural Resources, Ministry of 
Agriculture,  Food,  and  Rural  Affairs,  First  Nations  and  Métis 
communities, 
the  Lake  Simcoe  Region  Conservation 
Authority, municipalities,  and interested academic institutions 
to develop a climate change adaptation strategy for the Lake 
Simcoe Watershed.  

Lake Simcoe, [MNR] 

With  this  direction,  MNR  and  MOE  co-led  an  ecosystem-focussed  climate  change  vulnerability  assessment  for  the  Lake  Simcoe 
Watershed.  Additional  areas  of  analysis  included  infrastructure,  agriculture  and  tourism.  Adapting  to  Climate  Change: 
Recommendations to Inform Development of a Climate Change Adaptation Strategy for the Lake Simcoe Watershed (Douglas et al., 
2011)  describes  the  process  used  to  gather  and  summarize  adaptation  recommendations  to  support  development  of  the  Lake 
Simcoe  watershed  climate  change  adaptation  strategy.  The  process  involved  engaging  experts,  assessing  current  and  future 
vulnerabilities of selected natural and built systems’ assets, and generating adaptation recommendations. This work is ongoing, and 
has provided the foundation for learning and future efforts on ecosystem-focussed vulnerability assessments.
