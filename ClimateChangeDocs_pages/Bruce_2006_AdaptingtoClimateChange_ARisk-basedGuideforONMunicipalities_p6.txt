Risk management offers a practicable and 
credible approach for prioritizing complex risk 
issues and for selecting optimal risk reduction 
strategies in order to achieve acceptable levels 
of societal risk.  It also provides a means for 
balancing a range of considerations and for 
using predictive information.   
An abbreviated form of the process can be used 
to make a rapid assessment of a risk issue to 
outline the possible scope and its complexity.  
The process also caters to a large-scale fully 

 

comprehensive assessment which could involve 
a large number of representatives from many 
agencies over a longer period of time.  
Regardless of the scope of the exercise, it is 
important that municipal staffs be familiar with 
the process.  The documentation of the study 
will provide a persuasive business case to 
submit to the decision-maker. 
Most Canadian organizations, including 
municipalities, are familiar with and use risk 
management techniques, either implicitly or 
explicitly.  Managing risks is inherent in the job 
responsibility of most municipal managers.
