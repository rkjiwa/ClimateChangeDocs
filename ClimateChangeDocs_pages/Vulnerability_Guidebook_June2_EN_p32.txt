A lesson learned from 
forestry vulnerability 
assessment case studies 
(Johnston and  
Edwards 2013)
Identifying a strong champion 
of the vulnerability assessment is 
one key aspect to success. 

1.4  Confirm the Scope of the Assessment 

1.4.1  The Theory
At this early stage, vulnerability assessments can be complex and time-consuming. They 
can also be frustrating and unproductive if the scope does not match the resources 
available, leading to the withdrawal of participants from the climate change adaptation 
process. One important rule of thumb is to start with the simplest representation of the 
problem, increasing the complexity only as required (Ohlson et al. 2005).

Scaling an assessment to realistically match the resources available is essential at this early 
stage of climate change adaptation. Effectively exploring one aspect of the identified 
problem that leads to proactive adaptation and ongoing learning may be much more 
desirable than not initiating assessment and adaptation at all. Other aspects of the 
identified problems and challenges can then be assessed over time as part of an adaptive 
management approach, keeping in mind that the adaptation process is ideally an 
ongoing and iterative process (i.e., it is mainstreamed into day-to-day decision making).

Achieving buy-in and support from all organizations and interested parties involved in 
the SFM system of interest is important for the success of the vulnerability assessment. 
Identifying a strong champion is another key aspect of success (Johnston and Edwards 
2013).

1.4.2     The Practice
Worksheet 1.3 (Confirm the scope of the assessment) guides you in examining the 
resources required to undertake the assessment as defined. If you are unable to secure all 
of the necessary resources, you may need to prioritize and focus on specific aspects of the 
problem identified in Worksheet 1.1. If the scope changes, a new purpose and outcome 
statement should be prepared.

It may be necessary to garner further support, both financial and political, to conduct the 
vulnerability assessment as defined. Creating a short, clear summary of the vulnerability 
assessment project may be useful for presenting the assessment concepts to decision 
makers and other interested parties in efforts to gain support.
