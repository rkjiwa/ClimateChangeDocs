Impacts and opportunities

Adaptation actions

Climate / 

environmental 

risk factors:

Warmer air 

temperature (summer 

and winter; more 

variability)

Precipitation 

(changing seasonal 
patterns, increasing 

intensity and 

extremes)

• 

Increase in rail buckling events leading 
to greater potential for derailment and 
track-sensor malfunction; increased travel 
time/lesser speed; increased risk of hazard 
material spills

• 

•  Overheating of cargo/signalization 

equipment

•  Overall reduction in cold-weather rail 

maintenance requirements (opportunity)

• 

Flooded; service disruptions and delays; 
reduced on-time performance during 
extreme events 

Speed restrictions, service 
frequency reductions; air 
conditioning for signal 
equipment; inspect tracks 
more frequently; more 
timely service advisories and 
updates 

•  Cargo cooling/refrigeration

• 

• 

Flood-prevention engineering 
solutions; increasing travel 
advisories; modification of 
operations for forecasted 
conditions

Embankment-failure and 
high-water detector 
installation 

• 

Elevation of track

•  No adaptations identified in 
the literature for this category

•  Construction of dikes; flow 

management improvements 

Wind (changes in 

average wind speeds 

and extremes)

Changing water levels 
(lakes, rivers, ocean) 

• 

• 

Increased schedule disruptions and delays

Increased risk of hazardous material spills

•  Railcar blow-over

•  Disruptions to signaling equipment

• 

Flooding of rails near watercourses
