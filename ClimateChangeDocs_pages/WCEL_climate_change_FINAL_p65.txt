Climate change impacts may be less dramatic, but still significant in terms of 
infrastructure maintenance and performance.

In Williams Lake, increased freeze-thaw cycles resulted in accelerated road and 
airport runway deterioration, and also required improved ice and snow control 
measures and upgraded equipment.33

Infrastructure is also exposed to risks in a changing climate as a result of 
existing inefficiencies in terms of energy and water use and others. This type 
of “systemic under-performance” means that when the availability of inputs 
like energy and water are decreased due to ecological or economic pressures 
resulting from climate change, the infrastructure is vulnerable to failure. http://

In Castlegar it was found that decreased summer precipitation and increased 
residential water use could lead to infrastructure malfunction with respect 
to the water supply system. www.cbt.org/uploads/pdf/Castlegar_Climate_
