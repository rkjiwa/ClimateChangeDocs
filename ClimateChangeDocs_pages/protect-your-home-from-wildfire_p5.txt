How FireSmart is your “Second Priority” zone? 
The area extending from 10 to 30 metres away from your home is
Priority Zone 2. In this zone, you need to reduce fuels by thinning and
pruning trees so that intense wild!res don’t have as much fuel to burn.

What to do? 
Remove any trees and debris that would support the rapid spread of 
a wild!re. Make sure to thin or space trees so that the crowns (tops) 
of individual trees are at least 3 to 6 metres apart. 

Remove tree branches up to 2 metres from the ground. Also remove
thick shrubbery and deadfall to reduce the chance that a wild!re will
climb up into the forest canopy. Once a wild!re is crowning, it’s very
dif!cult to stop.

Because !res spread more easily uphill and downwind it’s important 
to extend Priority Zone 2 further on downhill slopes and on windward
exposures. 

Can you extend your FireSmart maintenance
plan to the “Third Priority” zone? 
Priority Zone 3 begins
30 metres from your home
and extends to a distance
of 100 metres and
beyond. In this zone the
objective is not to remove
all combustible fuels from
the forest, but to thin the
area so !res will be low-
intensity and more easily
extinguished. 

Low stand density where
trees are widely spaced.

Tree crowns do not touch
or overlap.

What to do? 
Thin or reduce the shrubs and trees that make up the understory. Try
to keep !re-resistant trees such as aspen, poplar and birch, while
spacing more "ammable trees so that each individual crown is at least
3 to 6 metres apart.
