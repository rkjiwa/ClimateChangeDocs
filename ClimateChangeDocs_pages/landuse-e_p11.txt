Edmonton’s Urban Forest Management Plan13
Edmonton (population 812 201), the capital 
of Alberta, is located along the North 
Saskatchewan River. The city’s urban tree 
canopy is seriously threatened by drought, 
insect infestations, disease, storms and climate 
change. These threats spurred Edmonton to 
create the Urban Forest Management Plan 
(UFMP) to guide the management of the tree 
canopy over a 10-year period. The UFMP 
includes developing an inventory of the urban 
forest (completed 2009), a review of existing 
planting strategies, a communication plan and 
potential tree planting partnerships. Many 
of these actions will increase resilience to 
drought conditions, which may be exacerbated 
by climate change. For example, Edmonton’s 
Forestry Unit is testing the use of different tree 
species, such as red maples, and alternative 
tree watering techniques.

imagineCALGARY14
Calgary (population 1 096 833) is situated in southern Alberta. The impact of climate change on water quality and 
quantity is of particular concern in the area. Local rivers are expected to experience decreased flow because of 
decreased precipitation and reduced glacial coverage in the headwaters of the river basins.15 imagineCALGARY was 
a community visioning and consultation process undertaken in 2005 to produce a 100-year roadmap for Calgary’s 
development. The process engaged more than 18 000 Calgarians representing businesses, community agencies, 
non-profits and governments as well as the public. Calgary is one of the first communities in Canada to consider 
climate change in its long-range planning. The City commissioned scoping reports to investigate how four major 
trends might impact the city: demographic changes, resource scarcity, technology transformation and climate 
change. Since publishing the imagineCALGARY plan in 2007, the City has implemented its vision and targets in 
subsequent land use plans and strategies. Numerous local partner organizations in the private, non-profit and 
public sectors have also committed to achieving the vision by changing their policies and practices.
