 

Definitions 
The  incorporation  of  climate  change  related  sea  level  rise  considerations  into  existing  BC 
Ministry of Environment documents is structured into three documents: 
  Draft Policy Discussion Paper 2010 
  Sea Dike Guidelines 2010 
  Guidelines for Management of Coastal Flood Hazard Land Use 2010. 
The  definitions  in  these  documents  follow,  where  possible,  the  definitions  and  terminology 
that  are  either  consistent  with  the  existing  documents  or  consistent  with  existing  practise 
worldwide.    In  some  cases  existing  definitions  or  terminology  require  modification  or 
clarification  for  application  to  coastal  flooding  or  sea  dike  application  in  a  climate  change 
driven sea level rise scenario. 
Existing  definitions  are  provided  below  in  italics  followed  by  any  necessary  modification, 
clarification or addition to the definitions or terminology in the existing documents. 
Acronyms associated with the definitions that are used in the text are shown in brackets. 

1.1  Annual Exceedence Probability (AEP) 
The  probability,  likelihood  or  chance  of  a  particular  event  (e.g.,  a  storm  or  a  storm  surge) 
being equalled or exceeded in any one year.  It is defined either as a number between 0 and 
1 or as a corresponding percentage. 
An  AEP  of  0.01  means  there  is  a 1% chance  of an  event,  of  a given  magnitude or  larger, 
occurring in any single given year. An AEP of 0.01 or 1/100 yr also suggests that on average, 
under certain conditions, the Average Return Period, or interval between recurrences of this 
event, is approximately 100 years.  

1.2  Average Return Period 
Over a long period of time, the average number of years between occurrences of a particular 
event. In general, the average return period is the reciprocal of the AEP – the relationship is 
illustrated in the following table:
