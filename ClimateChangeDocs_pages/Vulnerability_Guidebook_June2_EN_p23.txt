CHAPTER 1     PROVIDE CONTEXT  

FOR VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT

Before you begin:
It is recommended that you 
read Adapting sustainable 
forest management to climate 
change: a systematic approach 
for exploring organizational 
readiness by Gray (2012) and 
Adapting sustainable forest 
management to climate change: 
a framework for assessing 
vulnerability and mainstreaming 
adaptation into decision making 
by Williamson et al. (2012).  
It is also assumed that you and 
your organization are prepared 
to initiate an SFM vulnerability 
assessment  (see Gray 2012).
