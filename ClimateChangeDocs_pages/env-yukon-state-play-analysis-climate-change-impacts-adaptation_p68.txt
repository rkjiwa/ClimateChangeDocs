The current guidebook, one in a series by Canadian Council 
of Forest Minister’s (CCFM) Climate Change Task Force, 
provides a “how to” tool for applying the CCFM adaptation 
framework. It brings together many of the other tools 
explored in the series to provide a comprehensive 
approach, with phases for organizational readiness, pre-
vulnerability analysis, vulnerability assessment, and 
adaptation of sustainable forest management.
