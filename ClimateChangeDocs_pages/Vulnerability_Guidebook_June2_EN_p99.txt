wind, ice)
Intense rainfall or rain-
on-snow events (e.g., 
floods)
Change in snowfall or 
snowpack
Length or severity of 
fire season (e.g., Fire 
Weather Indexd)

road season)
Other

a Define the timeframe for the trend (e.g., 1950–2010), and for each factor indicate the measure (e.g., change per decade or over the period). 
b Seasonal maximum and minimum temperatures are the mean daily maximum and minimum temperatures, respectively, averaged over the months of the 
season.
c The Climate Moisture Index (CMI) was originally described by Hogg (1994, 1997) as a method for assessing differences in moisture regimes using simple climate 
data (temperature and precipitation).
d For information on the Fire Weather Index (FWI) see http://cwfis.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/background/summary/fwi. Many Provincial and Territorial departments 
responsible for wildfires maintain FWI data records.
