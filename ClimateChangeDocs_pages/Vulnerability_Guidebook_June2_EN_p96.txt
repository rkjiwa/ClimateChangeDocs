If most of the responses in Table 1.11 are “yes,” then your team is likely ready to go forward 
with a vulnerability assessment and adaptation project at the scale and scope you have 
defined. Remember that the process is intended to be iterative and adaptive; you can 
always get started and come back to certain steps once new information or knowledge is 
gained.

If most of the responses in Table 1.11 are “no,” then you probably need to do some 
additional preplanning to overcome some of the shortfalls. The following suggestions may 
help:

 

•   If human, financial, and/or information resources are limited or unavailable, you might 

look to other initiatives, programs, databases, research projects, etc., for support. 
Partnering with a local college or university to compile information or do analyses 
may be effective. 

 

 

 

•   Review the worksheets for chapter 1 with colleagues and managers to boost their 

understanding of potential impacts, and identify a champion if one is needed.

•   If interested groups or individuals are unlikely to support adaptation actions, consider 
having a respected champion speak to them, or review the worksheets for chapter 1 
with them.

•   Consider assessing a smaller geographic area or a selection of SFM activities for a 

better match with available expertise and resources.

1.3-D.     Refine the scope of the assessment 
Getting started with an assessment, even if it has not been perfectly defined, is often more 
beneficial than waiting until all the required resources can be gathered and the timing is 
“perfect.” That said, starting a complex task such as vulnerability assessment without a clear 
scope and without knowing that the assessment is feasible and achievable can lead to 
failure (see Moser and Ekstrom 2010).

At this stage, you should have a clear and defined statement of purpose for the 
vulnerability assessment, along with its expected outcomes. You will also have defined the 
scope in terms of both geography and participants. Now is a good time to examine the 
goals and scope and ensure you have the ability to achieve them. If not, you may want to 
redefine the statement of purpose, narrow the scope, or find additional resources before 
proceeding.
