3.  FUTURE VALUES

Figure 23 |  Climatic normals in the number of freezing-degree days for the period 1971-2000 along with projected  
future values for this index for the horizons 2050 (2046-2065) and 2090 (2081-2100), calculated using an  
 
 
ensemble of 79 simulations (75 from CMIP3 and 4 from CRCM4). The middle columns represent the median,  
while the left and right columns represent the 10th and 90th percentiles of the ensemble, respectively.
