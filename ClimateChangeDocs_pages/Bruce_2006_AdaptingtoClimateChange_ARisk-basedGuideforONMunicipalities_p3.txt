events that have direct effects on people and 
property, to fundamental changes to ecosystems 
that may undermine local economies, increase 
human health risks from infectious and non-
infectious diseases, and affect the availability 
and quality of water.  Climate change is, without 
a doubt, a real threat to our sustainability and 
quality of life.   
 
The Ontario Ministry of Municipal Affairs and 
Housing, together with Natural Resources 
Canada and the Institute for Catastrophic Loss 
Reduction, supported the development of this 
Guide to help municipalities understand and 
manage risks associated with climate variability 
and change and remaining uncertainties about 
future changes.  This is an important tool that 
can assist municipalities, Conservation 
Authorities and others, to reduce their 
vulnerabilities to the adverse impacts, of our 
changing climate. 

Foreword 
 
 
The Ontario government is committed to helping 
our communities to be strong, healthy and 
prosperous.  That is why we have developed 
policies to improve the air we breathe, ensure 
the quality of the water we drink, promote clean, 
reliable energy supply, and reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions.  That is also why we support our 
communities’ efforts to manage risks associated 
with the impacts of climate variability and 
change. 
 
Ontario’s climate has changed over the last 35 
years, and despite our best efforts to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions, will continue to 
change well into the future. Our climate is 
projected to warm by 2˚-3˚C over the next 50 
years and to become increasingly variable.  
These are not insignificant changes – by 
comparison, the Earth’s mean temperature has 
warmed only 4-5°C since the last ice age. 
 
These changes are beginning to have severe 
impacts, from more frequent and severe climate
