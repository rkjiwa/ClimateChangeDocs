Figure  7  |    Time  series  of  global  annual  mean  surface  air  temperature  anomalies  (relative  to  1986-2005)  from  
CMIP5 concentration-given experiments. Projections are shown for each RCP for the multi-model mean  
 
(solid lines) and the 5 to 95% rang (Â± 1.64 standard deviation) across the distribution of individual models  
 
(shading). Discontinuities in 2100 are due to different numbers of models performing the extension runs  
 
 
beyond 21st century and have no physical meaning. Only one ensemble member is used from each model  
and numbers in the figure indicate the number of different models contributing to the different time periods.  
 
No ranges are given for the RCP6.0 projections beyond 2100 as only two models are available.
