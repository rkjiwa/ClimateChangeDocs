1.10.2 BIAS CORRECTION
This method involves an adjustment or correction 
of the entire simulated time-series (reference and 
future periods) using a bias or correction factor 
such  that  differences  between  the  simulated 
reference period data and the observations are 
reduced. The correction factor is first calculated 
by comparing the simulated reference period and 
the observed data over the same time period, such 
as 1961-1990 (Figure 14a). The correction is then 

applied to the entire simulated series (Figure 14b). 
As for the perturbation method, a bias correction 
can be based on a mean correction or on quantiles. 
However, unlike the perturbation method where 
the correction is done for a given time horizon, this 
method allows for the bias to be removed from the 
entire simulated time-series.

the future is first calculated and B. the change is then applied to the entire simulated time-series.
