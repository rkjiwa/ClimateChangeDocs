Common sources of  
basement Flooding
• Stormwater or groundwater seeping into basement cracks 

or leaks in home foundation, basement walls, and/or around 
basement windows or doors

• Poor lot grading or drainage, or obstructions of drainage  

by gardens or landscaping

• Failure of foundation drain or weeping tile system
• Sump pump failure or power loss
• Overflowing eavestroughs and/or leaking or  

blocked downspouts

• Surcharged or blocked sanitary wastewater or stormwater 

pipes under street backing up into homes

• Blocked wastewater or stormwater lateral connections  

from homes to pipes under roadways.

Glossary of Terms 
Wastewater lateral: The 
pipe through which all the 
wastewater from a house  
(e.g. toilet, sink, shower, 
washing machine, floor drain) 
exits the home plumbing 
system and enters the 
wastewater sewer.
Downspout Disconnection: 
The diversion of roof 
runoff from a connection 
to underground lateral to 
stormwater or wastewater 
systems to a safe discharge 
point on the property where 
infiltration can occur. The 
discharge point must not 
affect home foundations, 
neighbouring properties, 
sidewalks or driveways.
Weeping tile: A perforated 
piping system along the 
basement footing. It is 
designed to receive water 
that has seeped down the 
foundation walls and direct  
it away from the home.
Sump pump: A mechanical 
device installed in a sump pit 
to remove water collected by 
the weeping tile and pump it  
to the ground surface or 
drainage system.
Sump pit: A tank or pit in the 
basement floor that holds 
the sump pump and collects 
stormwater drainage from  
the weeping tile system.
