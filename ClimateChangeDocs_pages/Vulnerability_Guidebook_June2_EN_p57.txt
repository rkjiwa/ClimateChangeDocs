Vulnerability

Definitions 
Exposure – The degree to which the SFM system is exposed to significant 
climatic variations, and the nature of that exposure, including both physical 
climate changes (e.g., temperature and precipitation) and resulting climate 
conditions (e.g., droughts, altered fire regimes, freeze–thaw cycles). 

Sensitivity – The degree to which all elements of the SFM system are 
affected, either adversely or beneficially, by climate-related stimuli. 
Sensitivity may depend on innate physiological or biological variables, 
physical or ecological factors, or the existence and extent of other stressors 
(e.g., habitat fragmentation or economic downturn). 

Potential impacts – The effects of climate change on the ability to achieve 
SFM objectives.

Adaptive capacity – The ability of the human elements of the SFM system 
to adjust to climate change (including climate variability and extremes) to 
moderate potential effects, to take advantage of opportunities, or to cope 
with the consequences. 

Vulnerability – The degree to which the SFM system is susceptible to, 
or unable to cope with, adverse effects of climate change, including 
climate variability and extremes, resulting in challenges to achieving SFM 
objectives. 

4.2.2     The Practice
The ability to achieve SFM objectives in the future will be affected by the projected 
impacts of climate change on forest ecosystems. Using the forest impact scenarios 
developed using Worksheet 3.2 (Develop and describe forest impact scenarios) 
and the best available information (studies, expert judgments, datasets, model outputs, 
etc.), assess the expected impact of climate and climate change on the ability to achieve 
SFM objectives. Record your assessments in Worksheet 4.1 (Assess current and future 
impacts on SFM). Impacts on the SFM objectives will depend on the degree of projected 
forest change and the sensitivity of the objectives to this change (e.g., the ability to 
maintain rare habitat on a land base is quite sensitive to changes in forest conditions 
resulting from climate change).
