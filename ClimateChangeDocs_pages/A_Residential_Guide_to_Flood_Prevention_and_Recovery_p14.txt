Know the risks 
Like any city, Mississauga is vulnerable to a variety  
of natural and human- caused hazards. Make sure 
you and your family members know what the hazards 
and risks are in the area you live. Even if you feel your 
community has a low risk of flooding, remember that 
anywhere it rains, it can flood. Just because you haven’t 
experienced a flood in the past, doesn’t mean you 
won’t in the future. Floods occur because of a number 
of factors including rainfall, topography, flood-control 
measures, creek-flow, old construction practices and 
new construction and development.

Make a plan 
Make sure everyone in your family knows what to do 
before, during and after an emergency such as a flood. 
Hold a family meeting to discuss how you can best 
prepare for an emergency. Have a plan. If you live alone, 
develop a plan for yourself with links to neighbours and 
friends. Keep a copy of your plan in a safe place, such as 
your Family Emergency Go-Kit. Photocopy your plan and 
keep it in your car and/or at work.

Get a kit
Assemble a 72 hour Go-Kit to use during an evacuation  
of your home or community. Make sure everyone living  
in the home knows where to find the Go-Kit.

Reduce your flood risk. 
Check for basement flood risk factors on Page 7  
and correct those that apply to your home.

Are you prepared?

A few steps you 
can take inside your 
home to reduce  
flood damage

• Do not store your important 

valuables or documents in 
the basement. Keep them 
at a higher level, protected 
from flood damage.

• Keep basement floor drains 

clear of obstructions.

• Elevate the furnace, water 

heater and other large 
appliances, and your 
electrical panel in your  
home if you live in an area 
that is prone to flooding.
