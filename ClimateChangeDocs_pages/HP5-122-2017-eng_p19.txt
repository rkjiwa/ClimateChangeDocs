to vulnerable patients, pre-summer vulnerability assessments, advice on routine 
care, education of health risks and appropriate behaviours; Development and use of 
vulnerability maps to allow targeting of vulnerable populations; and, Promotion of social 
capital development

•  Wildfires, such as: Increased contact with fire/fire front and evacuations; Avoid building 

• 

in vulnerable locations; Access to appropriate clothing, fire shelters (e.g. bunkers), and 
equipment (e.g. particle filtering masks) for high risk areas; and, Infection control, disease 
surveillance and appropriate emergency accommodation
Increases in air pollution, such as: Relocation to clean air locations such as office, 
libraries, etc.; Use of air conditioners, especially reverse cycle air conditioners set to 
recycle mode to filter air particles; Avoidance of exercise in affected environments; 
Spending less time outdoors; and, Use of air masks

•  Drought, such as: Distribution of public awareness materials/public service announcements, 
public education programs; Decreased availability and quality of water; Physical relocation 
of individuals/families to non-drought affected areas; School-based mental health programs 
in rural areas, participation of trusted adults who understand drought, early identification 
of mental health problems and referral; and, Training in coping mechanisms

•  Decreased availability and higher costs for fresh fruits and vegetables (for consumers), 
such as: Technological advances to increase production in new climate conditions; and, 
Improved food delivery systems 
Increase in water-borne pathogens and water contamination, such as: Boil water advisories; 
and, Monitoring of gastroenteritis
Increase in drought and temperature enabled vector-borne disease such as: Public education; 
Vector control (e.g. mosquito spraying); Medical prophylaxis and treatment; and, Vaccination 

• 

• 

•  Floods, such as: Flood-appropriate building and infrastructure construction standards 

for vulnerable areas (e.g. higher level bridges and causeways, water resistant emergency 
power); Physical and mental health impacts from increased flood incidence rates and
