1.3 ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS

The majority of trade in Atlantic Canada is conducted with partners outside of the region – primarily with 
the United States and other provinces, although international markets are becoming more important. 

Almost half of all freight traffic originating from New Brunswick and Nova Scotia is destined for other 
provinces, while less than 25 percent is intra-provincial (Gauthier, 2014). Prince Edward Island shares 
a similar freight pattern, with the majority of exports distributed across Canada. Newfoundland and 
Labrador is more closely connected to global supply chains than other Atlantic provinces, with 
approximately one-third of freight traffic destined for the United States, and one-third destined for the 
rest of the world (Lambert-Racine, 2013).

The Atlantic region is North America’s closest access point to Europe, and major ports in New Brunswick, 
Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland and Labrador play an important role (Canada’s Atlantic Gateway, 
2010). The regional economy is positioned for further growth in global trade, including increasing 
connections with emerging Asian markets through the Suez Canal. These trends are already underway 
– for example, the values of exports from Newfoundland and Labrador to China, the United Kingdom, 
Netherlands and France increased by more than 400 percent from 2010 to 2013 (Newfoundland and 
Labrador Statistics Agency, 2015). As trade activity along many regional and external routes expands, 
transportation operators are working to provide the capacity to meet this demand.  

Key exports from the Atlantic region include crude oil and refined energy products, fish, shellfish, 
minerals, lumber and pulp products, potatoes, and other vegetables. Key imports include many of 
these same commodities, as well as machinery/mechanical parts (Atlantic Canada Opportunities 
Agency, 2012).
