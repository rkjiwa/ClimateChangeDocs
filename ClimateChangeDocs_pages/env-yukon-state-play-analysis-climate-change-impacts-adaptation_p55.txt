Description 

Project work included a pan-territorial permafrost 
workshop held in Yellowknife in 2013 that facilitated 
permafrost information and knowledge-sharing across the 
three territories to enable an improved response to the 
impacts of permafrost thaw. Work also included the 
development of communications products to increase 
awareness of Yukon government adaptation actions.

Project identified priority areas of concern and examined 
climate change impacts on the hydrology of the Yukon River 
headwaters and implications for downstream energy 
generation.
