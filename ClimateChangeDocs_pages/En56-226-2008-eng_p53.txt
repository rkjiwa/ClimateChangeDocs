(cid:129)

(cid:129)

(cid:129) Encourage ground-source heat pumps: Soil and groundwater temperatures 10-50m below ground are
relatively cooler than surface conditions in the summer, therefore, ground-source heat pumps can serve
as an adaptation measure for space conditioning in the summer

(cid:129) Construct green roofs to provide cooling in summer and thermal insulation in winter, reducing energy

consumption and fuel costs
Lay out communities in a linear arrangement of open and built space to allow buildings optimum solar
gain in winter and cooling breezes in summer

(cid:129) Use greywater recycling to reduce upstream energy and environmental costs 
(cid:129)

Increase urban densities to minimise travel distances and create opportunities for community energy
schemes with advantages for emissions reduction

(cid:129) Employ innovative techniques to minimize energy consumption and costs in building construction and

(cid:129)

maintenance, such as:
(cid:129) Creating walls from hemp and chalk blocks, thereby using materials that require less energy for their
creation and installation and that help regulate temperatures naturally and efficiently throughout the
year 

(cid:129) Constructing internal door systems to help retain cool air in the summer and warm air in the winter  
(cid:129) Developing roof beams that overhang the sides of buildings, offering shading and helping to

maintain a cooler internal temperature 
Installing dark-coloured air extraction ducts that absorb heat from the sun, helping air inside rise up
and out of the building, and light-coloured ducts that draw fresh air in from the roof 
Installing ceiling panels cooled by water streams passing through them, thereby allowing the panels
to cool surrounding air 

(cid:129) Using thermal storage or mass to allow heat absorption during hot periods and dissipation during

cooler periods (e.g. thick, concrete ceilings)

(cid:129) Constructing floor vents that allow building occupants to control flow of incoming fresh air
(cid:129) Developing deep balconies and recessed terraces on building facades to provide space for plantings

that provide shade and evaporative cooling

(cid:129) Constructing aluminum fins over windows facing the sun and louvres to reduce solar heat gain and

provide shading 
Installing sunroofs that incorporate solar panels, reducing long-term maintenance costs and
contributing to lower energy usage 

(cid:129) Encouraging natural ventilation and daylighting to increase continued facility occupancy during

power outages

(cid:129) Change location and sources of electricity generation (e.g. co-locate greenhouses and centres of

electricity demand to offer higher security for the infrastructure)

(cid:129) Deploy renewable energy systems as they are relatively invulnerable to grid and fuel-supply

disruptions and can, therefore, enhance electricity-system reliability (e.g., micro-hydro, wind, solar
thermal, and solar electric power) 
(cid:129) Protect and conserve watersheds 
(cid:129) Watersheds with diverse vegetation are buffered from rapid influxes of runoff more effectively than

deforested watersheds
If rapid influxes are prevented, reservoirs are likely to produce more power on an annual basis
because operators are then able to move more water through turbines instead of spilling it during
heavy runoff episodes

(cid:129) Watersheds with reduced siltation have greater overall storage capacity, thereby preventing overflow

flooding and extending the lives of facilities 

(cid:129)

(cid:129)

Promote ‘cool’ or ‘white roofs’ to minimize damage to infrastructure. Cool roofs reduce damage from
ultraviolet radiation and daily temperature fluctuations, which cause repeated contraction and
expansion  
Planting vegetation (i.e. planting trees and vegetation to avoid subsidence in shrink-swell soils and
erosion of sandy soils) 

(cid:129) Deploy efficient refrigeration systems in order to maintain low temperatures significantly longer during

power outages
