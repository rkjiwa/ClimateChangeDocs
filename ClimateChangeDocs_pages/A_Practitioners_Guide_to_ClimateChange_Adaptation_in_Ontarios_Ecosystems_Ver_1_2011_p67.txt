Adaptation 

Initiatives  or  actions  to  reduce  the  negative  effects  of  climate  change  or  take  advantage  of  the  positive 
effects. 

A  process  by  which  individuals,  communities,  and  resource  managers  seek  to  moderate  and  cope  with 
the consequences of climate change (UNDP, 2005).  

Adaptation co-benefits 

Measures  that  simultaneously  reduce  vulnerability  to  climate  change  and  decrease  greenhouse  gas 
emissions. 

Adaptive capacity 

The ability or potential of a system to respond to climate variability and change. 

Adaptive management 

A  systematic  process for  continually  improving management  policies  and  practices  by  learning from  the 
outcomes of previously employed policies and practices. In active adaptive management, management is 
treated  as  a  deliberate  experiment  for  purposes  of  learning  (Millennium  Ecosystem  Assessment,  2005: 
599). 

Climate change 

Any change in climate over time whether due to natural variability or as a result of human activity. 

Exposure 

The nature and extent to which the system is exposed to significant climate variation. 

Impact 

The effects of existing and projected changes in climate in natural, built, and human systems. 

Mainstreaming  

The integration of climate change considerations into a range of policies, programs, and decision-making 
processes. 

Mitigation 

Resilience 

Actions to reduce the sources or enhance the sinks of greenhouse gases.  

The  ability  of  a  social  or  ecological  system  to  maintain  integrity  when  subject  to  disturbance  (UNDP, 
2005). For example, a resilient ecosystem can withstand shocks and rebuild itself when necessary. 

Resistance 

The capacity of the ecosystem to absorb disturbances and remain largely unchanged (Holling, 1973).
