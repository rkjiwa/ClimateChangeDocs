-  Reduce  the  amount  of  hard  surfaces  on  a  lot,  to  the  extent  possible,  and  include  “soft” 

landscaping where appropriate, including vegetated areas and gardens. 

 
Mandatory Actions to Reduce Basement Flood Risk: 

‐ 

In  many  cases,  municipal  governments  have  carried  out  detailed  engineering  studies  on  the 
causes  of  urban  flooding  in  their  jurisdiction.    Investigate  whether  such  studies  have  been 
conducted, and integrate the findings into the home/lot design. Also, ensure that any guidance 
and regulations on reduction of basement flooding available from the municipal government are 
integrated into the home/lot design; 

-  Do not install reverse sloped driveways; 
- 
-  Drainage of eavestrough downspouts and foundation drains to the surface of the lot, based on 

Lot grading must meet municipal guidelines, including proper backfilling; 

municipal guidelines; 

-  Proper  disconnection  of  the  foundation  drain  from  the  home’s  sewer  connections,  and 
installation  of  a  sump-pit  and  sump-pump  to  discharge  water  to  the  lot’s  surface,  based  on 
municipal guidelines.  A backup sump-pump that can run when the main pump fails or during a 
blackout should also be installed, and; 

-  Ensure home is isolated from the municipal sewer system(s), to the extent possible, where the 

municipality permits. 

 
Highly recommended, but not mandatory: 

Installation of an open-port backwater valve on the sanitary sewer lateral; 

- 
-  Reduce the amount of hard surfaces on the lot; 
-  Foundation walls waterproofing membrane; 
- 

Installation  of  warning  devices  such  as  alarms  to  detect  high  water  level  in  the  sump-pit  or 
malfunction of the sump-pump, and; 

-  Selection of moisture resistant flooring and wall finishes in the basement.
