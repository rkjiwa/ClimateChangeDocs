et al., 2010).  

The changes in climate that have been projected for this century have major implications for the composition, structure, and function 
of ecosystems and natural resources in Ontario (Varrin, Bowman, and Gray, 2007). Some species will adapt – by migrating, altering 
phenology (e.g., breeding  date), or seeking  alternative food sources. Others that  are less able to adapt to changing conditions will 
disappear from  all  or  parts  of their  current  range  (Chen  et  al.,  2011).  For  example,  it  is  projected  that  the southern  range  of many 
Ontario  species  such  as  moose, gray  jays,  and polar  bears  will  shift  north  (see, for  example, Obbard  et  al.,  2007;  Lemmen  et  al., 
2008).  

Decreases in ice cover and changes to freeze-up and break-up times will have physiological impacts on aquatic species and will alter 
the food-chain dynamics in aquatic ecosystems. Over the past 40 years, a decrease in the maximum amount of ice that formed each 
year  was  observed  on  all  the  Great  Lakes, ranging from  a  17%  decline  to  a  40%  decline  in the percentage  of  each  lake  that  was 
covered  in  ice  annually  (Karl,  Melillo,  and  Peterson,  2009).  Additional  information  on  the  impacts  of  climate  change  on  Ontario’s 
natural  resources  is  available  from  reports  in  the  Ministry  of  Natural  Resources  (MNR)  Climate  Change  Report  Series  and  the 
academic literature.
