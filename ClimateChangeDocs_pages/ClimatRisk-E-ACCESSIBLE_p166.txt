Figure 6b: Precipitation changes for Ontario in winter (December - February) under RCP 2.5 
(low-emissions scenario), RCP 4.5 (intermediate-emissions scenario), and RCP 8.5 (high-emissions 
scenario) for 2046-2065, compared to baseline years 1986-2005. (Source: Environment and Climate

Figures 6a and 6b demonstrate that under most scenarios, precipitation volumes will increase across 
the province in winter, with more areas experiencing declining precipitation in the summer. In the 
central and southern sub-regions, the intensity, duration, and frequency of some extreme weather 
events will likely increase in both summer and winter (Ontario Ministry of Transportation, 2013a; Chiotti 
and Lavender, 2008; Colombo et al., 2007; Deng et al., 2015). These events include ice storms, heat 
waves, freezing rain (increasing 40 percent), and intense rainfall (Reid et al, 2007; Cheng et al., 2007). 
While annual snowfall volumes will likely decline under warmer winter conditions in the next few 
decades, winter storms may increase in intensity (although decrease in frequency), yielding heavy 
accumulations of snowfall in singular storm events (Auld et al., 2006). Research focused specifically on 
Toronto also suggests that while the season in which  freeze-thaw events occur (where temperatures 
fluctuate above and below freezing in a short period of time) may contract, there is likely to be 
significantly more “freeze-thaw activity” during winter months (Ho and Gough, 2006; Federal Highway 
Administration, 2015).
