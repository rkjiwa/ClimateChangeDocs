Stormwater and wastewater  
systems for homes built during  
the 1970’s and 1980’s
Prior to the mid-1970’s, it was common practice to connect 
weeping tiles or foundation drains and downspouts directly to 
the wastewater system. Some of these historic connections still 
may exist today in older homes. These connections can overload 
the wastewater system and should be updated to help prevent 
basement flooding.
In 1975, Ontario’s Building Code was introduced and required 
stormwater collected from homes to be discharged to a separate 
stormwater system. 
Get to know how your home drains stormwater and wastewater 
and take the necessary steps to reduce the likelihood of 
basement flooding. You can also look for some tips on common 
causes of basement flooding on page 7 of this guide.
