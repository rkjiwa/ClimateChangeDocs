Climate Change and the Economy 

A recent report “Climate Ready Ontario’s Adaptation Strategy and Action Plan 2011-2014” highlighted 
the economic reality of failing to adapt to climate change.  Based on the Economics of Climate Change 
(2006),  Ontario  could  see  annual  costs  of  about  $5.66  billion  dollars  annually  to  respond  to  extreme 
weather brought  by climate  change.v  For example,  the  Ontario Disaster Relief Assistance Program has 
provided over $60 million since 1998 for flood relief alone in part due to an increase in the number of 
significant  urban  flooding  events,  including  floods  in  Peterborough,  Ottawa,  Sudbury,  Hamilton  and 
Toronto.   

In  2011,  the  National  Round  Table  on  the 
Environment  and  the  Economy  (NRTEE)  published 
their  report  “Paying  the  Price:  The  Economic 
Impacts  of  Climate  Change  for  Canada”.    In  this 
report,  the  NRTEE  expects  the  costs  of  climate 
change to escalate over time from an average of $5 
billion/year  in  2020  to  $21  to  $43  billion/year  by 
2050 depending on global emissions.vi   These costs 
will  not  be  equally  distributed  across  the  country 
with greater costs predicted for some coastal areas.   

At  first  glance,  the  costs  of  adaptation  are  often 
readily identified and dismissed as too expensive by 
many  governments  and  businesses. 
  However,
