1.1 increased surface water flooding
aCtion
include rainfall/stormwater management recommendations in the iSMp including: 
planning and design; runoff storage and conveyance practices; infiltration and 
filtration practices.
Within iSMp: recommend stormwater management opportunities identified 
during large site rezoning work that are transferable to other types of development. 
Within iSMp: resolve barriers that constrain streets draining to parks.

Within SMp: evaluate and provide bylaw revisions for impermeable surface 
allowance. recommendations for improved enforcement.
Within iSMp: increase the use of infiltration/detention bulges on streets where 
appropriate.
evaluate and recommend opportunities for stormwater detention or storage 
during park redesign and in new parks. implement and evaluate this approach 
during phase one of Hastings park. 
gCAp: encourage water retention on private sites, e.g. rock pits in one and two 
family dwellings.
Use best available climate model information and continue to monitor changing 
enviro. Can. and Metro Van. idF curves as design and monitoring input for 
stormwater system. 
initiate a pilot flood risk assessment in a catchment area identified in coordination 
with risk management. identify risk areas and complete a flowpath evaluation 
to determine correct sizing, curb design, inlet capacity and number of catch 
basins required. 
increase catch basin maintenance in areas identified as high risk for street 
flooding. 
implement permeability pilot projects to test and communicate the opportunities 
for detention and/or infiltration. 
raise awareness of public involvement in keeping C.Bs clean. 

increase existing storm pump station capacity 
develop and implement a process to release information bulletin/social media/
online information to alert public to check C.Bs when heavy rain is forecast.
examine whether turf fields are meeting community needs during rainy 
months or if additional artificial covers are needed. 
Assess feasibility of dewatering spot flooding with fire and rescue equipment
implement comprehensive software (311, Hansen, giS) to map recorded street 
flooding incidents.
