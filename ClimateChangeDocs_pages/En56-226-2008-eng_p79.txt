quality of life. The program’s website provides plans and technical studies, tools and resources

Planning Act: Ontario’s Planning Act provides communities with tools to influence and shape
their growth to ensure development takes place in compact, integrated, and more sustainable
ways. The Act requires that municipalities update their Official Community Plans every five
years, thereby allowing citizens to become more involved in the planning process and the most
current provincial and local priorities to be reflected in planning decisions.
