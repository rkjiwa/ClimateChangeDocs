Mould
• Moulds are found both outdoors and in homes and  
buildings, and can grow on practically anything that  
collects dust and holds moisture.

• Excessive dampness and mould growth on building  

materials and belongings can pose potential health risks. 
• Most types of mould are not a health concern for healthy 

individuals, but some individuals may experience  
respiratory symptoms such as asthma, sore throat  
and allergy-like symptoms. 

• Indoor air testing for mould is generally not recommended  

as results can be difficult to interpret.

Health effects related to mould depend on: 
• the type of mould 
• the amount of mould 
• the production of certain substances by the mould 
• the degree of exposure 
• the health condition of the person exposed

Some people who may be more at risk of having health 
effects when exposed to mould include: 
• pregnant women 
• infants 
• the elderly 
• those with existing health problems such as respiratory disease 

or a weakened immune system
