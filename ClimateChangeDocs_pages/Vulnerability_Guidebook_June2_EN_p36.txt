2.1  Overview

This chapter provides guidance on describing and documenting how climate has shaped 
current forest conditions and management practices in your SFM area. It also provides 
guidance on documenting any current adaptations to climate change that you may 
already be practicing. The chapter is structured around four worksheets that are designed 
to facilitate the gathering of climate information; the identification of relationships among 
climate, forest conditions, and current forest management policies and practices; and the 
recording of uncertainties and knowledge gaps: 

Worksheet 2.1.  Describe climatic conditions and trends

Worksheet 2.2.   Describe the relationships among climate, forest conditions, and forest 

management practices

Worksheet 2.3.   Describe how recent climate trends or changes in forest conditions have 

led to changes in current forest management practices 

Worksheet 2.4.  Identify uncertainties and knowledge gaps

Purpose of “describing current  
climate and forest conditions”

Outcomes

•   To document and understand how 

•   Description of current climate and 

climate has shaped current forest 
conditions and management practices

•   To identify any recent changes in climate 

trends and variability 

forest conditions

•   Improved understanding of the 

relationships among climate, forest 
conditions, and forest management

•   To document how current forest 

•   Identification of any recent changes in 

management practices have changed as 
a result of changes in climate

climate that have resulted in changes to 
forest management practices

•   A list of uncertainties and knowledge 

gaps  

2.2  Describe Climate Normals, Trends, and Variations

2.2.1     The Theory
Across Canada, the climate has already started to change (Lemmen et al. 2008).  However, 
SFM in Canada has, until recently, been based on the assumption that climate in a local 
area is relatively stable, within a known range of historical variability. As such, changes in 
climate have not been considered as a major factor affecting long-term decisions (see 
sidebar Climate terms).  

The climate measures that are important to document are those that might affect the  
SFM system. Although measures of annual climate conditions are helpful, the climate 
across Canada varies with the season, so seasonal measures are also important.

From the assessment 
framework…
“Determining and describing 
how forests are being affected 
by, and how forest managers 
have adapted to, current climate, 
clarifies relationships among 
climate, forests, and current 
management.”

—Williamson et al. (2012)

Understanding current 
climate and how any 
recent changes in climate 
trends or variability have 
affected your forest 
management practices 
can make assessing 
future vulnerabilities less 
daunting.
