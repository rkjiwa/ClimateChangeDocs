Case Study – Regional 
area: Southwest Yukon

The southwest Yukon has provided an ideal location for examining climate change 
vulnerability and adaptation. Accumulating evidence suggests that the Champagne and 
Aishihik First Nations (CAFN) Traditional Territory (CATT) in southwest Yukon is already 
experiencing the impacts of climate change. Warmer winters and warmer, drier summers 
beginning in the early 1990s have contributed to a severe spruce beetle outbreak affecting 
almost 400 000 ha of white spruce forest (of an estimated 600 000 ha) in the CATT. This 
is the largest and most intense recorded outbreak of spruce beetle in Canada. Climate 
change played a critical role in increasing the population of beetles to epidemic levels, 
a phenomenon exacerbated by the large tracts of mature white spruce characterizing 
the forests in this region. Also, since the mid-1990s, the spruce beetle outbreak has been 
driving forest management and planning efforts in the affected region. In December 2004, 
a Strategic Forest Management Plan (SFMP) for the CATT was jointly approved by the 
CAFN and the Government of Yukon. The plan identifies reduction of fire hazard, renewal 
of beetle-killed forests, provision of economic benefits, and preservation of wildlife habitat 
as priorities. In April 2006, the CAFN and the Government of Yukon jointly set a salvage 
harvest level for this zone of up to 1 million cubic meters of beetle-affected timber over 10 
years. Climate change impacts are likely to affect whether the community-directed SFMP 
goals, which include having functioning forest ecosystems and providing community 
sustainability and benefits, can be achieved. Although planning has been driven by a 
climatically induced outbreak, climate change adaptation was not an explicit consideration 
in the planning process. To explore the possibilities for such adaptation further, 30 
local forest practitioners engaged in a participatory process to identify climate change 
vulnerabilities and evaluate alternative adaptation options. A structured decision-making 
approach was used to frame the assessment. The existence of regional management 
objectives greatly facilitated the evaluation of over 80 adaptation options. Practitioners 
identified 24 of these adaptation options as being important to implement to achieve the 
regional goals and objectives of sustainable forest management in light of climate change.

National or provincial/territorial area – Not all issues lend themselves to assessment 
locally or regionally, and some climate change vulnerabilities and opportunities are 
best addressed at a larger scale. An example of a larger-scale project is the assessment 
examining the risk of the mountain pine beetle spreading beyond British Columbia 
to eastern pine forests. The National Forest Pest Strategy facilitated this assessment, 
with input being required from jurisdictions in both western and central Canada (see 
“Case study – National area: National Forest Pest Strategy”). The outcome of a provincial, 
territorial, or national assessment may include the establishment of broad policies 
providing guidance and support for adaptation planning at regional and local scales. 
These studies tend to be more strategic in nature.

In many cases, successful adaptation processes combine policy making with proactive 
risk management. In this way, key adaptation priorities are identified and addressed at the 
appropriate level.
