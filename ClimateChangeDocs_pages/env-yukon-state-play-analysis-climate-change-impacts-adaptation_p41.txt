Yukon ‘State of Play’:  
Analysis of Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation 
 
The threats posed by climate change to human health and wellbeing are a function of many 
factors, including exposure to climate hazards, sensitivity of exposed populations to 
environmental changes (especially the elderly and persons with pre-existing health conditions), 
and the capacity of the individuals or populations to proactively plan for change and/or to 
respond to disaster (Seguin, 2008; Seguin and Berry, 2008; Costello et al., 2009).

7.1  HEALTH AND WELLBEING ADAPTATION 

Understanding the implications of climate change for public health and wellbeing depends 
largely on our understanding of the breadth and depth of the relationship between climate and 
health, and extent to which forward-looking public health programming incorporates climate 
change considerations.  

Specific opportunities to improve Yukon’s capacity to understand and respond to direct and 
indirect climate change impacts on the health and wellbeing of its residents include:  

  Enhancing data collection and investing in research on the role of country foods in Yukoners’ 

diets, and the impact of climate change on availability and access to traditional foods; 

 

Identifying populations most at risk to climate change-related health risks and developing 
strategies and actions to increase awareness of these risks among these groups; 

  Enhancing mental health services in communities and supporting programs and initiatives 

that enable First Nations to reconnect with traditional land-use activities; and 

 

Investing in capacity to address health-related vulnerabilities that are increased by climate 
change, such as food and housing security, poverty and marginalization. 

Examples (see 9.APPENDIX B) of work on communities beginning to adapt to the health and 
wellbeing issues of climate change include:

“Pilot Study on the Health Effects on the Selkirk First Nation due to Climate Change” in 2009; 

“Climate Change and Health – Linking our Past and Future through our Traditions and 
Culture: An Ethno-Botanical Resource Study to determine the Effects of Climate Change on 
Traditional Ecosystems” in 2010; and 

"Keeping our traditions for the mental wellbeing of Selkirk First Nations Youth: What do we 
do at the fish camp when there is no fish?" in 2016. 

7.1.1  Adaptation Opportunity: Community-Based Climate Monitoring 

Community-based climate change monitoring initiatives may provide new opportunities to 
gather valuable data on impacts of climate change, while simultaneously enabling community 
members to re-connect with traditional and land-based knowledge. 

Not taking the action of further community-based monitoring does pose some risks as lack of 
local and community-specific data limits the effectiveness of adaptation efforts. It is important 
that initiatives to establish community-based monitoring programs consider how monitoring 
might help address local needs and vulnerabilities such as concern about the condition and 
populations of local game species.
