In 1974, a wind storm accompanied by high seas washed-out 30 m of railway track and derailed 
two diesel trains at Cape Ray, Newfoundland (Heritage Newfoundland and Labrador, n.d.). Coastal 
erosion has resulted in damaged tracks, slower speeds, operational delays, and rail closures in Atlantic 
Canada, affecting the movement of goods such as paper, coal, lumber, petroleum products, and 
chemicals (Genesee and Wyoming, Inc., n.d.). These disruptions have negative impacts on local 
industries (including intermodal facilities) due to delayed shipping, production, and refinement, and 
foregone profits/revenues. 

Slope failures in coastal areas have affected the Quebec North Shore and Labrador Railway (QNS & 
L) (Batterson et al., 1999; CBC News, 2014b), and will continue to pose risks in future (Spooner et al., 
2013; Evan et al., 2005).  Similarly, the Cape Jack section of the Cape Breton and Central Nova Scotia 
Railway (CBNS) has experienced severe erosion around coastal sections of track (Stephen Newson, 
Province of Nova Scotia, personal communication, 2015; CBC News, 2014a).  

Looking forward, an area of considerable concern is the Chignecto Isthmus, which is vulnerable to 
flooding and where flood risks will increase significantly throughout the 21 century as a result of sea-
level rise (Webster et al., 2011) (Figure 9; see Case Study 5).
