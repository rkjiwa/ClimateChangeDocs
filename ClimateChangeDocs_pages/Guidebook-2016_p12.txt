Figure 1 |  Steps of a climate change adaptation framework.  
Figure 2 |  Example of the natural variability in annual mean temperatures, as well as 10 and 30 year moving averages,  
without the effect of a long-term trend (such as would be produced under a climate signal with increases in  
 
 
GHG).

Figure 3 |  Time-series of annual temperature over Quebec, as simulated by the Canadian Regional Climate Model,  
along with trend lines for a relatively A. short period and B. longer period that highlight the fact that short- 
 
 
term trends may not reflect long-term climate change trends.

Figure 5 |  Global temperature change relative to 1986-2005 for the SRES scenarios run by CMIP3 and the RCP 
scenarios runby Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5, see section 1.6.1). The number of  
 
 
models is given in brackets and the shading (coloured envelopes) represents all model results.

Figure 7 |  Time series of global annual mean surface air temperature anomalies (relative to 1986-2005) from CMIP5  
concentration-given experiments. Projections are shown for each RCP for the multi-model mean (solid  
 
lines) and the 5 to 95% rang (± 1.64 standard deviation) across the distribution of individual models  
 
(shading). Discontinuities in 2100 are due to different numbers of models performing the extension runs  
 
beyond 21st century and have no physical meaning. Only one ensemble member is used from each model  
 
and numbers in the figure indicate the number of different models contributing to the different time  
 
 
periods. No ranges are given for the RCP6.0 projections beyond 2100 as only two models are available.   15

Figure 10 |  Projected change in mean summer temperature (June, July and August) and mean winter temperature 
(December, January and February). The changes are shown for an ensemble of GCMs under three RCPs 
 
(2.6, 4.5 and 8.5). The elliptical lines indicate the 10th, 50th and 90th percent confidence intervals. The  
 
scenarios close to the 10th, 50th and 90th percentile changes are circled in blue and highlighted with blue  
 
 
arrows.
