Additional water absorption — permeable surfaces and swales can ensure 
additional water absorption during heavy precipitation events that assists both 
with flood reduction and recharge of groundwater/aquifers.

The City of Surrey Soil Conservation and Protection Bylaw recognizes that soil 
is an important resource in the City and its unregulated deposit may obstruct 
water courses or aquifers, and have an impact on flood control strategies.

The District of Central Saanich has an award-winning ISMP (Integrated 
Stormwater Management Plan) for rainwater management. The bylaw 
requires rainwater capture, encourages use of the Water Balance Model. www.

The City of Richmond identified green roofs as a key way to manage and 
reduce run-off in industrial areas outside the city centre, where the surface is 
mostly covered by buildings, paved parking areas, loading bays and outside 
storage areas, and other options to manage and reduce run-off were limited. 
The Richmond bylaw takes a flexible approach, and provides several options 
for compliance with run-off and landscaping requirements, including the 
construction and maintenance of a green roof on 75% of the roof area of a new 
building. www.richmond.ca/__shared/assets/Bylaw_838521490.pdf

The City of Toronto has a green roof bylaw that applies to all new commercial, 
industrial and residential buildings over a certain size. The bylaw was enacted 
after a study from Ryerson University showed that green roofs could have 
significant benefits to the City related to stormwater management and 
reduction of the urban heat island and associated energy use. www.toronto.ca/

Regulation of landscaping and irrigation is a key tool for local governments to 
achieve water conservation, especially in drier climates. The City of Kelowna was 
one of the first to build this approach into landscaping and irrigation bylaws.

To consider:

•	

A number of similar objectives with respect to landscaping and run-off can 
be achieved through the development permitting process or landscaping 
and run-off bylaws. In practice, combining a planning (development permits) 
and regulatory (bylaw) approach may be most effective. Bylaws can include 
permitting requirements (a possible revenue opportunity) and fines, apply to 
landscaping of existing development, and may also require financial security for 
performance. Landscaping and run-off bylaws can apply to all properties, while 
DPs only apply to new development and re-development. For a discussion of 

A study carried out at 
the university of victoria 
demonstrated that 
in the Bowker Creek 
watershed on southern 
vancouver Island just 
three green infrastructure 
tools — rain gardens, 
green roofs and absorbent 
landscaping — could 
mitigate 95% of the 
peak flows estimated 
to result from increased 
precipitation due to 
climate change by 
2080. www.obwb.ca/
