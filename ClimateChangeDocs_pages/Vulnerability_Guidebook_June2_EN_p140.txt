Worksheet 6.3.   Implement (mainstream) recommended 

adaptations

Using the template presented in Table 6.5, identify the implementation requirements 
associated with each priority adaptation option. You may want to group the options by 
SFM objective and overall SFM system adaptation options or by strategic, operational, or 
adaptive capacity categorization. For each recommended adaptation option, consider the 
following: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

•   Assess the jurisdiction within which the adaptation actions fall and the roles and 

responsibilities of various agencies and individuals in implementation.

•   Identify the actions required to implement the adaptation (e.g., changes in planning, 

procedures, policies, regulations, legislation, investments, protocols, guidelines, 
training, and operational methods). 

•   Identify opportunities to mainstream the adaptation into regular business processes.

•   Identify roles and responsibilities (i.e., the specific person or department that will lead 

implementation and other individuals or departments that should be involved). Set 
deadlines for implementation progress.

•   Assess the internal support required for implementation to proceed (e.g., operational 

staff, specialists, senior management, political leaders). 

•   Assess the external support required for implementation to proceed (e.g., 

involvement or buy-in from other organizations).

•   Identify the human resources required for implementation to proceed and assess 

whether these resources are available or if they must be secured.

•   Assess information and/or training needs that may be required to implement the 

adaptation.

•   Identify the financial resources required for implementation to proceed and assess 

whether these resources are available or if they must be secured.

•   Describe what successful implementation would look like (e.g., all planning and 

operations staff are knowledgeable about climate change impacts and adaptation; 
silvicultural operations reflect changes in precipitation). 

•   Identify the overall schedule, the timing of specific events, and the milestones 

associated with implementation.

•   Determine if there is a need to communicate with decision makers, other staff, or 

interested parties about the adaptation and its potential implications.

•   Determine if there is an existing monitoring or tracking plan into which this 

adaptation should be incorporated.

•   Consider whether the adaptation can help to achieve other non-SFM objectives or 

goals.
