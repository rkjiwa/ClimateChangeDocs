Benefits of a strategic approach to climate change adaptation

Because the climate is changing, and will continue to change, local governments will find them-
selves adapting to the changes, whether they have planned to do so, or not. What is at stake is 
how successful local governments will be at minimizing the potential negative impacts of climate 
change on their communities, and realizing any opportunities that may arise.

To make the best use of scarce resources, local governments can plan ahead and use a strategic 
approach to climate change adaptation. Of course, after weighing options, a local government 
may still decide to take no action with respect to a future climate impact, but 
there is an important distinction between deciding not to act, and not acting 
because of inertia or failing to consider alternatives.9

A strategic, or planned approach to climate change adaptation has a number 
of key benefits for local governments:

•	 Greater opportunities for adopting measures that have co-benefits 

and align with other community goals can be explored; 

•	

•	

•	

•	

Time can be taken to evaluate and address potential insurance and 
liability issues arising from climate change impacts;

Cost savings can be realized by considering climate change impacts in the regular 
maintenance/updating/renewal schedule of existing infrastructure and by planning for 
new infrastructure to avoid expensive upgrades later; 

Adaptation measures that have unintended adverse impacts are more likely to be 
avoided if they have been identified and evaluated in advance;

Emergency needs can be identified and prioritized in advance of crises;

•	 Opportunities for cooperation with other governments and agencies can be explored;

•	

•	

•	

Communities can be consulted and engaged in developing and implementing 
responses;

Steps can be taken to enhance the resilience of vulnerable ecosystems before 
environmental thresholds are reached; and

Local governments can avoid committing to development patterns or development in 
areas that will pose significant risks for inhabitants over the longer term as a result of 
climate change impacts.

The table on the following pages is based on materials from Canada’s National Assessment for 
British Columbia and a format prepared for King County, Washington. The table lists some poten-
tial climate impacts in different sectors that are relevant to local governments in BC. It should be 
noted that not all impacts listed will occur in all regions.

Because the climate 
is changing, and will 
continue to change, 
local governments 
will find themselves 
adapting to the 
changes, whether 
they have planned 
to do so, or not.
