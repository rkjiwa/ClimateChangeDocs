Columbia Basin Trust, Communities Adapting to Climate Change.This 
site is a regional planning and action initiative to help local governments 
and First Nations start to prepare for climate change impacts. An 
excellent publication for a general understanding of the issues in a 
specific location. www.cbt.org/Initiatives/Climate_Change/

Environment Canada’s Canadian Weather Data Services

future weather conditions and offers multiple data access services to 
specialized users. www.weatheroffice.gc.ca/canada_e.html. 

Environment Canada’s Real-Time Hydrometric Data – Provides public 
access to real-time hydrometric (water level and streamflow) data

generate a map of your local watershed. http://map.ns.ec.gc.ca/kyw/.

Living Water Smart– Living Water Smart is the provincial government’s 
plan to keep our water healthy and secure for the future. This site also 
includes information on the modernization of the Water Act in BC.  
http://livingwatersmart.ca/.

The province maintains a Drought Information page and may initiate 
Drought Management Advisories and Directives for certain areas of the 
province. www.livingwatersmart.ca/drought/news.html.

Municipal Sustainable Bylaw Collection– A resource published by 
Federation of Canadian Municipalities highlighting excellent examples of 
bylaws, policies and procedures implemented by small and large Canadian 
municipalities in each sector of activity supported by the Green Municipal 
Fund. http://gmf.fcm.ca/Capacity_Building/Municipal-sustainable-bylaw-
collection/default.asp

Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium (PCIC), Plan To Adapt– This tool 
is designed to help assess climate change in a region by providing 
information on maps and in graphs and data tables based on a standard 
set of climate model projections. Users can view the information online 
as well as download data for further analysis, reporting and presentation. 
http://plan2adapt.ca/.

Partnership for Water Sustainability in BC and Waterbucket–The 
Partnership is helping the Province of British Columbia implement the Living 
Water Smart and Green Communities initiatives. We are doing that through 
shared responsibility in delivering the Water Sustainability Action Plan. 
Waterbucket is a rich, highly interactive ‘designation location’ for timely  
and provocative information about water sustainability in British Columbia. 
www.waterbucket.ca.

Re-Tooling for Climate Change–The ReTooling for Climate Change website 
is a first stop for elected officials and staff of local governments, First 
Nations, and everyone else interested in learning about climate change 
adaptation. www.retooling.ca/

Water Balance Model–The vision for the Water Balance Model (WBM) as a 
practical decision support tool that bridges engineering and planning. The 
WBM provides a continuous simulation of the runoff from a development 
area, or from a watershed with multiple land uses, given the following inputs: 
continuous rainfall data, evapotranspiration data, site design parameters, 
source control information, and soils information. Historic rainfall data can 
be modified to create climate change scenarios within the WBM. www.
waterbalance.ca/. For an example of how the WBM can be used to guide 
planning and design decisions about source controls for low impact 
development see www.waterbalance.ca/sql/tutorial/Demonstration.html.

Water Conservation Calculator– The Water Conservation Calculator is an 
on-line user-friendly tool geared for water purveyors of smaller communities. 
Its purpose is to illustrate how specific conservation measures yield both 
fiscal and physical water consumption savings. Smaller communities often 
cannot allocate resources to traditional infrastructure projects or cannot 
budget for the development of professional water conservation/efficiency 
plans. Water purveyors can use the tool to assist in presenting their 
conservation case to council and other decision makers.

9.2 ClimA te ChAnGe
In order to identify and manage climate-related risks in the context of 
water and watershed planning, communities need easy-to-understand 
information about past and future climate change and its impacts on 
water, watersheds, and aquatic ecosystems across British Columbia. 
This section provides links to up-to-date information on climate change 
and impacts on water. Those resources created in easy-to-understand 
language for non-technical users are identified with an asterix (*).
