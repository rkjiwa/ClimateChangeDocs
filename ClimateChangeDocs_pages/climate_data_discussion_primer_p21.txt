anticipated service life of the infrastructure.  They can find ensembles of results to be overly 
detailed and will ask for a “best estimate” for the parameters in question.  This will be difficult 
for the scientist to provide, as each model and emissions scenario provides a unique, and equally 
likely, prediction of future climate.  To compound matters, given the way that models are 
structured, it is possible that the same model, using identical input values, may provide slightly 
different projections of future climate conditions over a series of runs.   
 
The members of an assessment team can alleviate some anxiety by having very explicit 
discussions regarding the assumptions inherent in different emissions scenarios and the strengths 
and weaknesses of the different models used to generate the ensemble.  With this context, an 
experienced professional engineer can apply professional judgment to establish appropriate input 
information for an infrastructure assessment.

The scientist may view the engineers’ approach to the information to be quite different than their 
own.  On the other hand the engineer can perceive the scientist’s approach to providing 
information to be overly cautious at the expense of timeliness and resources.  As the information 
provided by the scientist is being applied for engineering purposes it is only important that it is 
sufficient to the purposes of the project and it does not need to be “perfect”.

In engineering it is important that data be 
sufficient for its intended purposes.  The 
pursuit of perfection in data can result in 
significant project delays and cost overruns.  
As a result, the engineer will consistently 
evaluate data to ensure that it meets the 
minimum quality requirements for a particular 
project.  Once this is achieved they will 
constantly evaluate the cost and schedule 
implications of improving data beyond this 
point.

Science is a constant search for truth.  It is 
important for a scientist to assure themselves 
and their peer group that the data is a close to 
perfect as possible.  They will face challenges 
on their approaches and outputs based on this 
kind of constant assessment.
