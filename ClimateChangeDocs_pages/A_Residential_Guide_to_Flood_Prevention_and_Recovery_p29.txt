Health 
considerations

Stay safe while addressing a flood in your home. Below is some 
important health information, along with tips and considerations 
to keep in mind while you are managing clean up and repairs. 
First and foremost, wear appropriate personal protective 
equipment, wash hands frequently with soap and clean water  
and protect open sores with waterproof coverings.

Potential health risks
Contaminated flood waters can pose a  
risk to your health
Ingestion of disease-causing bacteria, viruses and other germs 
found in sewage can cause gastrointestinal (GI) illness. Ingestion 
occurs from eating contaminated foods, drinking contaminated 
water or accidentally touching your mouth with contaminated 
hands. Vomiting and diarrhea are common symptoms of GI illness. 
Skin contact with contaminated flood water can cause skin rashes 
and infection in open sores. 

Indoor air quality
During clean up and over time, indoor air quality can be affected, 
such as:
• Dust created during clean-up activities can become airborne. 

Close off the flooded areas during clean up and repair to prevent 
dust spreading to other rooms in the house. Also, keep rooms 
well ventilated while working. 

• Use of cleaners and disinfectants can release vapours. Keep 

rooms well ventilated. Wear protective clothing such as gloves 
and masks and keep children away from the area when using 
these cleaning solutions.  

• Mould can grow on wet building materials and belongings. 

Discard contaminated items and dry remaining items as quickly 
as possible (i.e. within 48 hours).
