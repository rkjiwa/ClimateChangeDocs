3.5 ADAPTATION PLANNING GUIDEBOOKS
Several Canadian guidebooks have been produced that 
describe the steps a community can take to formulate 
an adaptation strategy and action plan (see Appendix B). 
Several of these guidebooks outline a standard planning 
process that is then tailored with information that is 
relevant to preparing for the impacts of climate change. 

The guidebooks are typically based on the experience and 
insights of pilot communities and may include case studies 
and prepared worksheets, as well as tips and practical 
information. The other decision-support tools described in 
this document – visualizations, vulnerability and risk assess-
ments, and scenario planning – may be included within the 
adaptation planning process described in the guidebooks. 

Windsor’s Climate Change Adaptation Plan
Windsor (population 216 000) is located in southwestern Ontario on the south shore of the Detroit River and Lake 
St. Clair. Climate change impacts of concern include an expected increase in the frequency and intensity of heavy 
rain storms and heat waves (a doubling of the number of 30°C days has been projected by 2050).83 These changes 
could pose serious problems for the city. In 2010, for example, a significant rainstorm that delivered 90 mm of rain 
in a 24-hour period led to widespread basement flooding throughout the city.84
Windsor began developing its adaptation plan in 2010. The City is working through the five-step adaptation 
planning process outlined in Changing Climate, Changing Communities, a guidebook published by ICLEI Canada.85 
The steps are initiate, research, plan, implement and monitor. The City is midway through that planning process. 
The development of Windsor’s adaptation plan builds on existing initiatives, including a heat alert and emergency 
response system, the expansion of a waste water treatment facility, various initiatives aimed at reducing basement 
flooding, and the construction of a new retention treatment basin to reduce combined sewer overflows. City officials 
intend to integrate the actions identified in the adaptation plan into existing policies, programs and operations.
