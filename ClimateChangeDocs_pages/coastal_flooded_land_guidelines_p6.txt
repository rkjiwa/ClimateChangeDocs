 

The expected location of the future Natural Boundary is then defined by estimating the additional 
influence  of  waves  and  their  effect  on  the  slowly  changing  shoreline.    The  elevation  of  this 
reference point, defined as the Flood Construction Reference Plane (FCRP), Figure 2-2, is defined 
as: 
Flood Construction Reference Plane (FCRP)  =  Designated Flood Level (DFL) 
 
 
The Estimated Wave Effect can be defined to be 50 per cent of the calculated Wave Run-up on the 
estimated  future  shoreline.    This  percentage  is  based  on  an  analysis  of  existing  data  (2010), 
described  below,  and  may  be  revised  as  more  information,  including  site  specific  surveys  or 
detailed engineering investigations undertaken by qualified professionals, becomes available. 
The role of the existing legal Natural Boundary is preserved for defining the Sea Level Planning 
Area, as also indicated in Figure 2-2. 
The  Flood  Construction  Level  (FCL),  which  will  also  vary  for  a  both  a  given  target  year,  and  a 
specific area, is defined as: 
 

+ Estimated Wave Effect 

Flood Construction Level = FCRP + Freeboard 

 
The Freeboard allowance should be the greater of: 
  0.6m, or; 
  For flood proofing fill – the crest elevation of an equivalent sea dike (see Sea Dike Guidelines 

2010) 

  For exposed vertical building foundations – the wave-structure interaction; 
  For tsunami areas – the runup elevation of the appropriate tsunami hazard. 
 
Setbacks remain essentially unchanged. 
Further  details  of  the  basis  and  relationship  between  the  Existing  Definitions  and  the  Updated 
Definitions are provided in Appendix B.
