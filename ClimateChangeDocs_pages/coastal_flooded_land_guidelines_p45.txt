Sample Planning Wording 
The Official Community Plan Policies Template (Form 1, Appendix B of the existing guideline 
document Land Use Guidelines 20041) should have the following statement appended: 
“In  coastal  and  estuarine  lowland  areas  of  BC,  Sea  Level  Rise  may  increase  the  risks  of 
flooding to existing and proposed developments. The OCP text and maps describe Sea Level 
Rise Planning Areas and associated Flood Construction Levels based on best current Sea 
Level  Rise  projections.  The  OCP  and  maps  describe  the  locations  and  Flood  Construction 
Levels  for  buildings  based  on  the  planned  building  lifespan.  Where  buildings  are  to  be 
constructed  within  the  SLR  planning  area,  they  shall  be  subject  to  a  restrictive  covenant 
stipulation of the hazard, building requirements, and liability disclaimer” 
The  text  of  the  OCP  should  also  state  that  the  policies  related  to  Sea  Level  Rise  will  be 
subject to refinement as more data and information becomes available on SLR elevations and 
risks for the plan area.
