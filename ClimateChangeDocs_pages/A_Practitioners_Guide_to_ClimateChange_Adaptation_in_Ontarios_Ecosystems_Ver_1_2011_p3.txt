Ontario’s climate is warming and becoming increasingly variable. It is possible that temperature, precipitation, and wind patterns will 
continue  to  change  for  decades,  perhaps  centuries,  affecting  the  way  communities  throughout  Ontario  manage  their  natural 
resources  and  infrastructure,  and  changing  the  lives  of  people  who  depend  on  these  assets  for  health  and  well-being.  Currently, 
Ontarians  are  responding  to  the  known  and  potential  impacts  of  climate  change  in  two  ways:  mitigation  through  greenhouse  gas 
emission reductions, and adaptation.  

Integrating  climate  change  adaptation  into  natural  resource  management  requires  an  understanding  of  the  known  and  potential 
impacts of climate change and the  corresponding vulnerability of, and risks to, ecosystems and the people who rely on them. This 
guide was developed to help practitioners respond to and prepare for climate change. It was also prepared in response to the Expert 
Panel on Climate Change Adaptation (2009) recommendations, the commitments contained in Climate Ready: Ontario’s Adaptation 
Strategy  and  Action  Plan  (Government  of  Ontario,  2011)  and  the  Ministry  of  Natural  Resources’  strategic  priorities  on  climate 
change. 

This  guide  introduces  the  concepts  of  climate  change  adaptation,  vulnerability,  and  risk.  It  also  describes  vulnerability  and  risk 
assessment tools and techniques, and a framework that can be used to support adaptive management in a rapidly changing climate. 
Ultimately, the guide seeks to assist natural resource managers to identify ways that climate change vulnerabilities and risks can be 
integrated into decision-making processes that include adaptation action plans, strategies, and policies.
