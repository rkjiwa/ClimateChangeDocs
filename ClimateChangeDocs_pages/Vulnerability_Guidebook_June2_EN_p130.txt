7.5  Worksheets for Chapter 5
The following worksheets are designed to help you develop and assess adaptation 
options for SFM.

Worksheet 5.1  Develop potential adaptation options for SFM objectives
 
 

Table 5.1  Prioritize vulnerabilities of SFM objectives
Table 5.2   Potential adaptation options for SFM objectives and 

assessment of importance of implementation 

Worksheet 5.2 

 

 Develop potential adaptation options for the overall SFM system 
of interest

Worksheet 5.1.   Develop potential adaptation for SFM 

objectives

Prioritize the vulnerabilities of SFM objectives: On the basis of work done in Table 4.3, 
review the vulnerability (i.e., high, medium, or low) of the SFM objectives in your study 
area to current climate and future scenarios of climate change. You may want to sort 
the vulnerabilities from high to low, or start only with objectives that are ranked high or 
medium across all scenarios. Record the selected priority objectives in the table below and 
indicate how they are vulnerable to climate change. This step is optional, and you may 
instead decide to consider all vulnerabilities listed in Table 4.3.
