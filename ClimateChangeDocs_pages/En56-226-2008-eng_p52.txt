SECTOR

(cid:129)

Improve the effectiveness of pest, disease and weed management practices through wider use of
integrated pest management, development and use of varieties and species resistant to pests and
diseases, and improvements in quarantine capabilities and sentinel monitoring programs

(cid:129) Diversify income by integrating other farming activities such as livestock raising
(cid:129)

Increase inputs of organic matter to improve soil fertility, enhance soil water holding capacity and
reduce soil erosion

(cid:129) Match ranching stocking rates with pasture production
(cid:129) Rotate pastures

(cid:129) Encourage conservation plantings 
(cid:129) Create and protect green infrastructure in urban areas, such as open spaces, woodlands, street

trees, fields, parks, outdoor sports facilities, community gardens, village greens, private gardens,
and green or living roofs and walls, to garner not only biodiversity but also recreational,
temperature, energy, flood storage, noise reduction, and air purification benefits

(cid:129) Return land with low fertility to forest in order to decrease land degradation and water stress
(cid:129) Alleviate ‘coastal squeeze,’ the pinning of natural salt marsh against man-made flood defences by
rising sea levels, by breaching existing hard, coastal flood defences (e.g. seawalls) and allowing salt
water back onto land originally reclaimed by such defences

(cid:129) Create and protect blue spaces, such as rivers, lakes and urban canals, to provide habitat for native

species, help manage rising temperatures through evaporative cooling, and mitigate flooding by
providing storage areas for excess water  

(cid:129) Enhance or replace lost ecosystem services (e.g. manual seed dispersal, reintroduction of

pollinators, application of pesticides)

(cid:129) Enhance natural resilience to climate change by reducing threats such as habitat fragmentation or

destruction, over-exploitation, eutrophication (i.e. over-enrichment of water bodies, leading to organic
growth and depletion of oxygen ), acidification, pollution and introduction of alien species

(cid:129) As noted above with regards to biodiversity, allow breaching of existing hard coastal defences to

allow salt water back onto land originally reclaimed by such defences to alleviate ‘coastal squeeze’,
thereby allowing local vegetation to disperse wave energy during storm events, reducing coastal
erosion, and providing habitats for coastal flora and fauna 
Implement integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) (i.e. integrate and balance multiple
objectives in the planning process, consider resilience of coastal systems at broader scales)
Introduce marine protected areas and ‘no take’ reserves

(cid:129)

(cid:129)

(cid:129) Encourage biking and use of public transit (e.g. create networks of bike trails, improve transit

service coverage and frequency); these transportation modes lead to improved air quality through
lowered emissions and improved public health 

(cid:129) Establish and protect green spaces and features, such as street trees, courtyards, green corridors,

smaller open spaces, and green/living roofs. These features help to reduce urban temperatures
through evapotranspiration and shading, help purify city air, lower noise pollution and improve
quality of life 

(cid:129) Creating networks of cool roofs 
(cid:129) Employing ‘cool’ or ‘porous pavements’ 
(cid:129) Building narrow streets and orienting buildings and streets to reduce excessive solar gain and

catch breezes, which helps reducing the need for cooling 

(cid:129) Constructing thermal chimney vents and louvres to move warm air away from working and living

spaces with benefits in minimized cooling

Increase health indicator monitoring and data accessibility to potential users 

(cid:129) Employing advanced glazing systems to reduce solar heat gain
(cid:129)
(cid:129) Employ strategies to manage and respond to high temperatures, such as establishing and protecting
blue spaces such as ponds, roadside swales, flood balancing lakes, swimming pools, fountains, rivers,
lakes and urban canals to lower surrounding air temperatures through evaporative cooling
