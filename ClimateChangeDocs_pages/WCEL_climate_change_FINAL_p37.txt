Aquifer protection:

•	 Local governments have used DPAs to protect aquifers by helping to maintain the 

groundwater absorption capacity of land, protecting water quality and limiting demand 
for groundwater. Possible measures include restricting development, setbacks from 
watercourses, requiring hydrologic studies, retaining vegetation, etc. See www.obwb.

Flood hazards:

•	 The District of Sechelt DPA for Watercourses (Habitat protection and creek hazards) 
requires that a hazard assessment report accompany applications for DPs, and that 
it “[A]ssess long term risks or changes to the defined floodplain or slope stability, 
including potential increases in rainfall, flood frequency or flood severity associated 
with climate change” www.district.sechelt.bc.ca/Portals/0/Public%20Document%20
Library/Community%20Plans/DPA%202%20Watercourses.pdf

•	 The District of Elkford Climate Adaptation Strategy proposes a requirement that natural 

vegetation be maintained or enhanced to support the ability of the riparian area to 
mitigate flooding. www.elkford.ca/include/get.php?nodeid=93

Climate change impacts on the natural environment:

•	 The City of Comox DPA for Garry Oak Habitat justification notes that most Garry Oak 

ecosystems have been destroyed or significantly degraded, and “Less than 5% remains 
in near-natural condition, and ecosystems at extremes, such as those in Comox, are 
especially vulnerable. Ecosystems at the edges of their distribution typically contain 
high biodiversity and have important adaptive value in the face of climate change.”

Permit Area, investigating options to protect sensitive terrestrial ecosystems 
as sea level rises and shorelines shift inland. www.islandstrust.bc.ca/ltc/th/pdf/

•	 The West Howe Sound, Sunshine Coast Regional District OCP has a Shoreline Protection 

and Management DPA aimed at protecting the ecological values in the shoreline and 
foreshore, as well as hazards to the built environment. Development permits must 
include an assessment by a professional of the impact of the proposed development 
on “[e]xisting and anticipated shoreline processes, including erosion and deposition 
of land and beach materials, given projected environmental trends including climate 
change and sea level rise.” www.scrd.ca/files/File/Community/Planning/WHS%20

Energy efficiency and resiliency:

•	 The City of Castlegar OCP has an Energy, Water and Greenhouse Gas Reduction DPA that 

applies to a number of different zones within the municipality and includes objectives 
regarding passive solar design, green roofs, building orientation, landscaping, and 
renewable energy generation. www.castlegar.ca/pdfs/OCP_Bylaw_1150.pdf

Trust is considering 
a Marine Shorelands
