 

 

-   Practice – provides practical guidance for completing the worksheets, along with 

suggested alternative methods (a basic approach and a more comprehensive 
approach) for tailoring the guidance provided to each project’s unique 
circumstances  

 

 

•   Case studies to demonstrate how some of the vulnerability assessment concepts 

have been put into practice across Canada

•   Strategic and operational considerations for implementing methodologies 

described herein, drawn from the literature and practitioner’s experiences 

The purpose of each chapter and its associated worksheets are described in Table 0.1. 

Although a sequential approach is recommended, it is not essential, and an iterative 
process may be required as the assessment project unfolds. In addition, not all worksheets 
will be useful for all projects, and it will be up to each assessment team to determine 
which will be the most helpful for their project and to identify the best available method 
for completing them, given the resources available.  

Throughout the guidebook several methodological approaches, ranging from basic 
to more comprehensive, are provided to help the user understand how to approach 
the framework steps and worksheets. The approach selected will often depend on the 
assessment resources available and the scope and scale of the assessment. 

Users of the guidebook should seek to understand  
and investigate the trade-offs inherent in selecting  
one approach over another. 

For example, selecting a basic approach may provide an easier and quicker route to the 
next step in the vulnerability assessment process but may mean that critical aspects of 
the SFM system are not considered. Conversely, a more comprehensive approach may 
mean that more information and more aspects of the SFM system are considered, but 
more resources and time may be required to gather the data, information, and knowledge 
required to complete the assessment stage.  

The steps in the CCFM adaptation framework, and the guidance presented within this 
guidebook, are based on principles of structured decision making (identify objectives, 
define problem, identify and assess options against objectives; see sidebar Structured 
Decision Making), principles of adaptive management (plan, act, monitor, evaluate, 
adjust), and decision making under uncertainty (e.g., employ scenarios to explore possible 
futures). 

Users are encouraged to treat every step of this guidebook 
as an ongoing and iterative process, and to understand that 
each step can be revisited once new knowledge is gained. 

Also, although the worksheets provided represent a suggested approach to applying the 
framework, users of this guidebook are encouraged to adapt them as required. However, 
users should try to adhere to the concepts within the framework even if such adjustments 
are made.
