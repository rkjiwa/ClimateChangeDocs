1.0 HEALTH IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE

Risks to the health of Canadians from climate change include direct and indirect illnesses1 and 
deaths related to poor air quality, water- and food-borne contamination, changing patterns of 
diseases spread by animals, ticks and insects, and extreme weather events including extreme 
heat events and urban heat islands. Human-generated greenhouse gas emissions2 (GHGs) 
contribute to climate change and these gas emissions derive in part from aspects of the built 
environment3 such as transportation systems and infrastructure, building construction and 
operation, and land-use planning (1,2). 

Special challenges and impacts on northern Canadians are already being observed such as more 
dangerous travel (unusual changes in ice, snow and land conditions), damaged infrastructure 
due to permafrost melt, threats to traditional food sources, disappearance of drinking water 
sources and related-psychosocial and cultural impacts. Those most vulnerable are facing several 
compounding risks such as chronic health conditions, multiple environmental hazard exposures, 
the extremes of age, socio-economic deprivation, physical and/or social isolation. Sustainable 
healthcare in a changing climate presents further risks to Canadians as its capacity is strained 
in many ways such as from the aging population, resource intensive infrastructure, professional 
needs and budget constraints (1). 

Key areas of health risks linked to climate change are now examined.

1  Such as: asthma, respiratory allergies, and airway diseases, cancer, heat-related morbidity and mortality, human developmental 

effects, cardiovascular disease and stroke, mental health and stress-related disorders, foodborne diseases and nutrition, neurological 
diseases and disorders, vector-borne and zoonotic diseases, waterborne diseases, weather-related morbidity and mortality. 

2  These are gases that trap heat in the atmosphere.
3  The built environment means the buildings, transportation systems, energy systems, open space, and agricultural 

lands that make up and support our communities (Toronto Public Health; www1.toronto.ca/wps/portal/
