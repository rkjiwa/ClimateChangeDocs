Priority 

First-order priority:  
A most relevant point; has 
direct bearing on major 
issues; must be resolved, 
dealt with or treated. 

Second-order priority:  
Relevant to the issue; has 
significant impact but not until 
other items are treated; does 
not have to be fully resolved. 

Third-order priority: 
Insignificantly relevant; has 
little importance; not a 
determining factor to major 
issue. 

No priority; no relevance: 
No measurable effect; 
should be dropped as an 
item to consider. 

Definitely affordable: 
Can be implemented within 
current fiscal realities . 

Feasibility: 
Affordability 

AND/OR 

High cost-sharing 
opportunities. 

Some indication adaptation is 
affordable: 
Possibility that adaptation can 
be implemented within current 
fiscal realities. 

Some indication adaptation 
is unaffordable: 
Additional financial resources 
or reallocation required to 
implement. 

AND/OR 

Some cost-sharing 
opportunities. 

AND/OR 

Low cost-sharing 
opportunities. 

Definitely unaffordable: 
Adaptation cannot be 
implemented within current 
fiscal realities. 

AND/OR 

No cost-sharing 
opportunities. 

 

Feasibility: 

Legal, political, 
institutional, and 

social barriers 

No identifiable internal or 
external: 
Can definitely be 
implemented. 

Some identifiable internal or 
external barriers: 
Barriers most likely can be 
overcome.  

Some identifiable internal 
or external barriers: 
Barriers too significant to 
overcome. 

Obvious and significant 
internal or external 
barriers: 
Cannot be implemented. 

No risk: 
Rigorous science and 
information show no 
ecological risk in 
implementing.  

AND/OR 

Vulnerability assessment is 
highly certain. 

 

Degree of 
ecological 

suitability (risk) 

 

 

Low risk: 
Some information is available 
showing potential ecological 
effects of option. 

Moderate risk: 
No information on the 
ecological effect of this 
option for local conditions. 

High risk: 
Little to no information at 
all on the ecological effect 
of option.  

AND/OR 

AND/OR  

AND/OR 

Vulnerability assessment is 
fairly certain. 

Vulnerability assessment is 
moderately uncertain. 

Vulnerability assessment is 
highly uncertain.
