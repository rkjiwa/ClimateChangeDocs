STEWART - SEPTEMBER 2011 

In early September 2011, 333 mm of rain fell in the Stewart region of British Columbia, including 111 
mm of rainfall in a single 24-hour period (Fraser Basin Council, 2015). The event caused significant 
flooding and resulted in road washouts and bridge failures, including a failure of the bridge at Bitter 
Creek (Figure 10).  Washouts and the damage at this bridge closed 61.5 km of Highway 37A from 
Stewart to the Meziadin Junction with Highway 37. The bridge failure isolated the town of Stewart 
from the rest of British Columbia, stranding 117 tourists and vehicles.  Tourists needed to be air-lifted 
to Prince Rupert while vehicles were shipped out of the region by barge.  A temporary bridge was 
constructed by the British Columbia Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure, which was later 
replaced by a permanent structure. Transportation damages arising from this storm event resulted in 
$7 million in response costs and $11 million in repair costs that continued through the summer of 2012 
to complete.
