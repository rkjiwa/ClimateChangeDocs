URBAN TRANSPORT

Impacts to urban transportation systems (Figure 6) include many of the same issues and 
opportunities identified for road and rail systems in the sections above.  Risks more unique to urban 
systems are associated with underground transit systems and electrical systems. Weather-induced 
shifts between modes of passenger transport are also more relevant in an urban context. For 
example, extreme temperatures, precipitation, and strong winds all reduce the percentage of trips 
taken by walking or cycling.
