Category

Criteria

1 (low)

2 (medium)

3 (high)

SUSTAINABILITY:
SOCIAL,
ECONOMIC,
ENVIRONMENTAL

EFFECTIVENESS

RISK AND
UNCERTAINTY

OPPORTUNITY

IMPLEMENTATION

Mitigation 
co-benefits
Environmental
impacts

Result in increased
greenhouse gas emissions
Result in net environmental
costs

Equity

Benefits to few people

Implementation
Cost

Operating and
Maintenance Cost
Robustness

Reliability

Urgency

Degree of risk
or impact
Precautionary

Ancillary
benefits

No-regret
option 
Piggybacking

Window of
Opportunity
Public
acceptability
Funding sources

Capacity (info,
technical, staff,
resources)
Institutional

Cost of implementation is
high relative to cost of
inaction
Cost of operation and
maintenance is high
Effective for a narrow range
of plausible future scenarios
This measure is untested

Risks are likely to occur in
the longer-term

Future risks are minor and
reversible
The risk is generally
understood
This measure will contribute
little or not at all to other
goals for the community
This measure will have little
or no benefit if climate
change impacts do not
occur
There is no window of
opportunity currently
Likely to face public
opposition
External funding sources are
required but have not been
identified
Current capacity is insufficient
and gaps cannot be easily
addressed
Implementation requires
coordination with, or action
by, other jurisdictions

Would not affect
greenhouse gas emissions
Result in no-net loss of
habitat or ecosystem
services
Benefits to many people

Cost of implementation is
moderate relative to cost
of inaction
Cost of operation and
maintenance is moderate
Effective across many
plausible future scenarios
Experimental but has
expert support
Impacts are beginning to
occur, or are likely to occur
in the near- to mid-term
Future risks are moderate
and reversible
Some uncertainty exists

This measure will contribute
somewhat to other goals
for the community
This measure will have
some benefits regardless of
actual climate change
impacts
A window of opportunity
could be created
Not likely to receive much
public attention
External funding sources
are required and likely to
be secured
Gaps exist in one or 
more areas but can be
addressed
Implementation requires
external approval

Would reduce greenhouse
gas emissions
Result in net environmental
benefits

Significant benefits to many
people
Cost of implementation is
low relative to cost of
inaction
Cost of operation and
maintenance is low
Effective across a wide range
of plausible future scenarios
The effectiveness of this
measure is proven
Impacts are already
occurring

Future risks are potentially
catastrophic or irreversible
The risk is not well
understood
This measure will contribute
significantly to other goals
for the community
This measure will result in
significant benefits
regardless of actual climate
change impacts
A window of opportunity
exists to implement
Likely to receive public
support
Funding is available

Current capacity is
sufficient

Implementation is within
local control
