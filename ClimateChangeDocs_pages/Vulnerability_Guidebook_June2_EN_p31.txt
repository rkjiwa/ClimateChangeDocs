1.3.2     The Practice
In practice, a number of issues may drive adaptation, thus influencing the aspects of 
the SFM system that should be assessed. Consider the problems or challenges that you 
identified in Worksheet 1.1 as having prompted this assessment, to aid in defining the 
scale, boundaries, and elements of the SFM system to be considered in the assessment. 
Describe the SFM system in enough detail to give all assessment participants a good 
understanding of the biophysical aspects (i.e., the forest ecosystems) within the defined 
geographic scale, the benefits and values derived from the forests within this area, and 
the decision contexts and the stakeholders or interested parties within the defined 
assessment scope. 

Worksheet 1.2 (Describe the SFM system and define the scope of the vulnerability 
assessment) provides guidance on describing the SFM system of interest and defining 
the scope of the SFM vulnerability assessment.

H I N T

You may want to build a 
team work plan and a team 
charter to outline each 
memberâ€™s commitments 
and tasks for the 
vulnerability assessment. 
You may also wish to 
consider a communications 
plan that defines the key 
participants and interested 
parties and how you plan 
to involve them in the 
assessment process and 
communicate to them the 
progress and results of the 
assessment.

A basic approach

Operational 
considerations  

Strategic considerations  

A local-level, single-driver assessment tends to be the simplest approach. You may wish to 
constrain the boundaries of your assessment to something at this scale, particularly if you 
have limited resources and/or a desire to gain some experience in vulnerability assessment 
and adaptation planning before taking on a more complex and challenging assessment at a 
broader level.

A more comprehensive approach depends on your unique situation. Scoping the most 
appropriate SFM area to address your needs, given available resources, is the ideal approach. 
Also, no matter the scale at which your SFM area is defined, it is essential to pay attention to 
cross-scale issues and considerations. 

Keeping your decision-making context in mind may help in determining the SFM system 
for the assessment. Matching your SFM system to the decisions that you wish to inform 
may help to enhance the uptake of the vulnerability assessment and its relevance to the 
decision-making process.

Is your vulnerability assessment and adaptation planning process being driven by a single 
issue or vulnerability? Or is there a desire to perform a comprehensive assessment that 
examines all potential vulnerabilities? Consider these questions as you decide upon the 
SFM system for the assessment. Having a clear notion of your SFM system will help you 
to target your assessment and information-gathering process and to more clearly define 
the interested parties, stakeholder groups, and/or assessment partners. Also, keep in mind 
that climate change may interact with other drivers of change, such as changes in markets 
conditions or workforce availability and new technologies.
