than for average temperatures. Figure 4 shows average observed and projected summer and winter 
temperatures for all of Québec.

Figure 4: Observed average summer (JJA: June, July and August) (Figure 4a) and winter (DJF: 
December, January and February) (Figure 4b) temperatures for the 1971-2000 period (left panel) 
and projected (right panels) for the 2050 horizon (2041-2070).  The observed average is calculated 
from CRU TS 3.21 dataset (CRU TS = Climatic Research Unit Timeseries, 3.21 dataset is the name of the 
release). Future maps present the ensemble median (i.e., the median of all the available projections) 
as well as the 10th and 90th percentiles (i.e., lower and higher bounds) of 29 future climate scenarios. 
Future climate scenarios were produced using the “delta” method calculated from the CMIP5 
(Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5) simulations (RCP 8.5) and applied the observed 
data (see Charron, 2014). (Source: Ouranos)
