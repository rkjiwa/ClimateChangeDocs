Yukon ‘State of Play’:  
Analysis of Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation 
 
Although progress has been made in this area, climate change adaptation still is not 
systematically considered in most government policy decisions. This makes Yukon more 
vulnerable to climate change impacts, as present-day solutions are developed without adequate 
understanding of how the problems being addressed may be affected by climate change over 
the long term.
