Worksheet 6.2.   Recommend priority adaptation options for 

implementation

Use the list of top-priority adaptation options to complete Tables 6.3 and 6.4. For each 
option, assess the following:

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

•   Is the option a modification of current practice? If so, note where it is referenced in an 

existing policy, plan, or operations guide.

•   Is the adaptation ecologically suitable and socially acceptable?

•   Is the implementation of the adaptation financially and technically feasible? 

In particular, is implementation feasible given institutional and organizational 
considerations? 

•   Does the option conflict with other management objectives or SFM values? If so, note 

them here. Are these conflicts resolvable? 

•   Given the suitability, feasibility, and potential conflicts, can the adaptation option be 

recommended for implementation? 

•   What is the timeframe for implementation (e.g., immediate, near future, distant 

future). Define the various timeframes in specific terms. 

•   With implementation of these adaptations, do you expect to be able to achieve SFM 

objectives in your study area? Indicate yes, no, or uncertain in Table 6.4, with a brief 
explanation.
