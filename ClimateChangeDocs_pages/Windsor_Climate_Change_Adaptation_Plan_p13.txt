Climate Change Adaptation Plan  2012 

 
Although most scenarios of future climate projects increases in regional precipitation, the increase in 
evaporation caused by higher temperatures is expected to lead to an overall decrease in the Great Lakes 
System water levels.  Increased evaporation is expected in all seasons, and particularly in winter as a 
result of decreased ice cover on the lakes.  The impacts of lower water levels will be most pronounced in 
parts of the system that are already shallow, specifically western Lake Erie, Lake St. Clair, and the St. 
Clair and Detroit Riversxii. Canadian modelling predicts a significant lowering of lake levels by 2050 as a 
long-term average, with a predicted decline of 0.8 m for Lake Eriex.  

The lowering of water levels in the Great Lakes â€“St. Lawerence System may impact several sectors as 
identified in the figure below.

Some economic losses associated with a decrease in lake levels are easily calculated.  For a 2.5 cm 
lowering of Lakes Michigan-Huron, cargo ships must reduce loads by 90 to 115 tonnes worth 
approximately $25,000 US per tripx.  Based on historical water level changes, it is known that 
hydroelectricity output may be reduced by up to 26% at some stations with lower water levelsxii.
