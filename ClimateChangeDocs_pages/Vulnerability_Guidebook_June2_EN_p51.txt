From the assessment 
framework…
“The second step in developing 
forest impact scenarios is to 
evaluate the response of forests 
and forest ecosystems to each 
climate scenario (i.e., the climate 
change impacts). This response 
(i.e., the effects on the forest) will 
be a function of the magnitude 
of the change in climate under a 
particular scenario (i.e., exposure) 
combined with the degree to 
which the forests are able to 
tolerate or adapt to the  
degree of change in climate  
under a particular scenario  
(i.e., sensitivity).”

—Williamson et al. (2012)

3.3  Develop and Describe Forest Impact Scenarios

3.3.1     The Theory
Forest ecosystems are sensitive to climate and will be affected, both directly and indirectly, 
by changes in temperature, precipitation, and frequency of extreme weather and weather-
related events (e.g., droughts, floods, wildfires, pest outbreaks, tree diseases). Potential 
forest impacts will depend on the extent of climate change (i.e., exposure) and the 
sensitivity of the forest to such change. Additionally, forest ecosystems are complex and 
consist of many interactions and feedbacks that make it difficult to predict the impacts 
of future climate change, particularly given the uncertainty in the rate and amount of 
future climate change. One approach to dealing with this uncertainty is to develop a 
range of potential forest impacts based on multiple future climate scenarios (see sidebar 
Confidence and Uncertainty).

Williamson et al. (2008) summarized the potential impacts of climate change on Canada’s 
forests and forest ecosystems at a broad scale. However, for many SFM vulnerability 
assessments, a finer-scale analysis of climate change impacts on forests may be required. 
The scientific literature is rich with information about the impacts of climate change on 
forest ecosystems. Also, numerous modeling approaches and tools are available that can 
be used to estimate climate change impacts on forests. 

Many of the vulnerability assessment case studies highlighted by Johnston and Edwards 
(2013) used both detailed modeling efforts and forest impact scenarios generated by local 
forest practitioners to develop a range of potential impacts to different future climates. 
Halofsky et al. (2011) and Swanston et al. (2011) have also provided relevant examples of 
how to develop forest ecosystem impact scenarios for use in vulnerability assessment.

3.3.2.     The Practice
Use Worksheet 3.2 (Develop and describe forest impact scenarios) to record 
the range of potential impacts on forests, given the climate scenarios developed in 
Worksheet 3.1 (Develop and describe future climate scenarios).

Potential forest impacts will depend on the extent of climate change (i.e., exposure) and 
the sensitivity of the forest that is affected by climate change. Williamson et al. (2008, 
Figure 2) outlined a method to map the potential impacts of climate change on forests. 
Additionally, the Canadian Forest Service’s Forest Change initiative (described in section 
2.3.2) is producing knowledge products and tools related to forest impacts from climate 
change across Canada. These knowledge products and tools are being developed with 
forest practitioners in mind, with the goal of assisting them in developing forest impact 
scenarios. Many provincial forest services, climate consortiums (e.g., Pacific Climate 
Impacts Consortium, Ouranos, ClimateWNA), and universities also have forest impact 
modeling resources available for forest practitioners to use when considering climate 
change. Use these products in conjunction with practitioner knowledge and expert 
opinion to develop scenarios of forest impacts. You may also wish to consult or partner 
with academic researchers to investigate potential climate change–related forest impacts.
