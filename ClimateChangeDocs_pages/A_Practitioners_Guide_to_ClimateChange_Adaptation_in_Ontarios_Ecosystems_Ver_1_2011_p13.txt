Adaptation  is  an  adjustment  in  natural  or  human  systems  to  moderate  and  cope  with  the  consequences  of  climate  change.  The 
essence of adaptation is to “learn while doing” (Lee, 1999). Adaptation is characterized by actions that reduce negative impacts and 
risks  caused  by  climate  change  and  increase  the  magnitude  and  likelihood  of  preferred  outcomes  (Williamson  et  al.,  2011).  This 
process  involves  learning  about  vulnerabilities  and  risks,  evaluating  possible  responses,  implementing  adaptation  action,  and 
revising  choices  with  new  learning  (Leary  et  al.,  2008).  Adaptation  can  include  but  is  not  limited  to  specific  actions  (e.g., 
improvements to stormwater management), systematic change to organizational operations, and institutional reform.  

Given the uncertainty of future conditions at specific locations or points in time, adaptive management is important because it is an 
iterative  process  based  on  monitoring,  new  learning,  and  the  re-evaluation  of  management  goals  (Swanston  and  Janowiak,  in 
review). 

Several  interrelated  concepts  of  climate  change  vulnerability,  risk,  and  uncertainty  form  the  basis  for  practical,  hands-on  impact 
assessments.  The  concepts  are  fundamental  components  for  mainstreaming  adaptation  initiatives  into  natural  resource 
management.
