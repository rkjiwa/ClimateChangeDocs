 Adapting to Climate Change:  
The Need and the Challenge

Depending on the region, climate change may result in productivity changes, 
maladaptation of trees, changes in forest land cover or species composition, increases 
in the frequency and intensity of biotic and abiotic disturbances, and a host of other 
biophysical effects. In some cases forest productivity will be enhanced by climate change. 
However, it is expected that the overall net effect of climate change on Canada’s forest will 
be negative, particularly in the absence of early adaptation (Johnston et al. 2009). 

The potential effects of climate change on forests will likely have important implications 
for Canada’s ability to achieve sustainable forest management (SFM) objectives and goals 
as currently defined. Consequently, climate change was identified as one of two strategic 
issues of national importance for Canadian forest management, and the Canadian Council 
of Forest Ministers (CCFM) has recommended that consideration of both climate change 
and future climatic variability is needed in all aspects of SFM (CCFM 2008).  

The CCFM has identified six defining criteria that must be met for forests in Canada to 
be considered as being managed sustainably (see sidebar What is Sustainable Forest 
Management?). SFM is a moving target to which many managers aspire but which they 
often find difficult to achieve because of dynamic environmental, economic, cultural, and 
social conditions. As a consequence, SFM demands continuous monitoring, improvement, 
and adjustment. With the additional stresses and pressures caused by changing climate 
conditions, it is now widely acknowledged that forest managers may face unprecedented 
challenges in reaching this common goal of sustainability.

Currently, SFM policies and practices are often based on an assumption that future 
environmental processes and conditions shaping forests will be within the range of 
variability that shaped the current forest. Under a changing climate, however, this 
assumption may no longer be valid. Recognition that future climate (and hence growing 
conditions, the rate and severity of natural disturbances, conditions for forest harvest 
operations, etc.) will be different from the climate of the recent past and that of the 
present calls for a fundamental rethinking about approaches and assumptions used 
in forest management. Failure to acknowledge the new reality of climate change may 
result in widespread impacts, many of which could be reduced or avoided if appropriate 
adaptation actions were identified, planned, and implemented today. Information about 
the vulnerability of forest management systems is needed to determine how best to 
incorporate climate change considerations into definitions of SFM and into the norms, 
standards, practices, and policies that are used to implement and monitor SFM.

Adaptation offers a path forward for forestry practitioners to meet the demands of 
the forest sector within the context of complex socioecological systems and a rapidly 
changing climate. Adaptation seeks to ensure that the breadth of ecosystem services 
provided by forests and underpinning the competitiveness of Canada’s forest sector is 
maintained under future climates. In other words, the purpose of adaptation is to identify
