4.2 FUTURE CLIMATE RISKS

The British Columbia Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure has completed five assessments using 
the Public Infrastructure Engineering Vulnerability Committee (PIEVC) Engineering Protocol (see Box) 
to determine vulnerability to road transportation infrastructure in British Columbia from future changes 
in climate, and identify potential adaptation measures (Table 5, Figure 11) (British Columbia Ministry 
of Transportation and Infrastructure, 2014b).  The assessments covered a broad range of geographic 
and climatic conditions.
