(Soft Armouring)

1.  Objectives & Policies
•  Growth management 

objectives, 
establishment of 
policies

•  Coastal management 

approach based on 
sensitivity to impact

2.  Coastal Hazard 

Mapping

• 

•  Mapping of areas at 
risk of erosion due  
to sea level rise
Identification of 
minimum floor 
elevations (Flood 
Construction Levels)  
to reduce risk to 
buildings in hazard 
areas

3.  Risk Management
•  Measurement of 

the likelihood and 
consequences of risks 
to property, buildings 
and people

•  Cost benefit analysis
•  Vulnerability 

assessment

•  Resilience assessment

4.  Emergency Planning 

and Preparedness
•  Prepare emergency 

plans for flooding and 
other disasters

1.  Regulations of  

Land Use

•  Zoning Bylaw to 

regulate land use, 
density, siting 
of buildings and 
servicing standards
•  Designation of land  

as a floodplain

•  Minimum building 

elevations & setback 
for land in floodplain

2.  Subdivision 
Regulation

•  Regulation to protect 
development in areas 
subject to coastal 
hazards

•  Regulation where the 
natural environment 
would be adversely 
affected due to sea 
level rise

3.  Development Permit
•  Regulation of specific 
development plans to 
protect environment 
or development from 
hazard

4.  Building Regulation
•  Restriction of building 

construction to 
address safety of land 
subject to coastal 
hazards

1.  Land Acquisition
•  Land purchase or 
expropriation to 
prevent development 
in area at risk due to 
sea level rise

•  Land purchase to 

implement non-
structural adaptation 
to sea level rise

2.  Transfer of 

Development 
Potential

•  Transfer of allowable 

development potential 
to an alternative 
location not at risk
•  Creation of ‘density 

bank’ to accommodate 
density transfer

3.  Easments and 

Covenants

•  Easement on title to 

restrict use of land for 
conservation or other 
non-development 
purposes

•  Other restrictions 
include: statutory 
right-of-way, covenant 
or servitude

1.  Scour Protection
•  Foundation protection 

for a new or existing 
building

•  Protection of a linear 

structure base

2.  Structural Elevation
•  Addition of structural 

fill to raise the land 
below a building 
above the flood  
level risk

•  Raising the habitable 
areas of a building or 
the entire building 
itself

3.  Dikes
•  Linear shoreline 

protection structure 
as a primary defense 
from flooding
Includes accessories 
such as floodboxes 
and floodgates

• 

4.  Land Trusts
•  Management of land 

for conservation 
or other non-
development 
purposes by land 
trust or other separate 
environmental 
organization

5.  Foreshore Tenure
•  Lease or Licence of 
Occupation of area 
from the Crown below 
the natural boundary 
to allow integrated 
management of 
foreshore

4.  Other Hard Protection
•  Off-site structural 
works to protect 
shorelines from 
flooding
Includes seawall, 
groyne, revelment and 
storm surge barrier

• 

•  Secondary protection 

including roads and 
back-up dikes

5.  Wet Floodproofing
• 

Installation of building 
materials that can 
withstand temporary 
flood damage

•  Location of electrical 

and mechanical 
fixtures above the area 
subject to flood risk

1.  Coastal Wetland 

Creation or 
Restoration

•  Creation of a buffer to 

reduce wave energy

•  Creation or restoration 
of wetlands to increase 
adaptive capacity of 
ecological areas at risk 
due to coastal squeeze

2.  Dune Building or 

Rehabilitation

•  Creation or 

rehabilitation of dunes 
to provide a buffer to 
reduce flood risk

•  Creation of off-shore 

islands

3.  Beach Nourishment
•  Addition of sediment 
on an ongoing basis 
to satisfy natural 
erosional forces
