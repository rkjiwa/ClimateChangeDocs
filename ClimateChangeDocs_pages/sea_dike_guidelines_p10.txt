3.2.5  Meteorological Water Level Effects 

Sea levels along coastal British Columbia are also affected by meteorological and oceanographic 
conditions specific to the area that result in differences between the predictable astronomical tides 
(Section 3.2.4) and the actual water level at a given time.  These conditions include: 
  Sea level change due to changes in atmospheric pressure. 
  Sea level change due to the effects of strong winds blowing over the water surface. 
  Sea level change due to wave momentum effects in shallow water 
  Sea level change due to changes in ocean currents or temperature. 
The integrated effect of these forcing mechanisms can be seen in measured water level data by 
removing the predicted astronomical tide, which then defines a residual water level that reflects all 
of the forcing mechanisms outlined above. 
In coastal British Columbia waters, the characteristics of residual water levels can be defined with 
the assistance of the long term measured water level records available from several long term CHS 
tide recording stations along the coast.  Long records of recorded total water levels are available at 
the stations summarized in Table 3-2.
