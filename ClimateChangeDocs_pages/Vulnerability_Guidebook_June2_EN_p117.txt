4.2.2      Knowledge capital (science, information, knowledge 

exchange, and technology)

Knowledge capital is the stock of scientific and nonscientific information that supports 
forest management and the information management process to ensure access to and 
usability of the information. In the context of climate change, knowledge capital is the 
stock of relevant knowledge or information that supports impacts analysis and adaptation 
decision making for the SFM organization or system of interest. Knowledge capital related 
to climate change also includes the ability to develop, interpret, and utilize scientific 
knowledge and information about climate change and the ability to communicate 
and make accessible relevant knowledge and information. It includes the processes by 
which information is acquired, accessed, and communicated, as well as the capacity for 
knowledge exchange. Knowledge exchange and information management contribute 
to increased awareness of climate change and to more informed and effective decision 
making. Knowledge gaps can pose significant barriers to adaptation.
