Chapter
1.  Provide context 
for vulnerability 
assessment

2.  Current climate 

and forest 
conditions 

3.  Future climate 

and forest 
impact scenarios

4.  Assess 

vulnerability

Description
This chapter provides guidance 
for how to begin assessing 
vulnerability to climate change 
and mainstreaming adaptation 
into SFMb. The focus is to 
develop an understanding of 
the need to address climate 
change and thus undertake an 
SFM vulnerability assessment, 
and to clearly define the goals 
of the assessment.

This chapter provides 
guidance on describing and 
documenting how climate 
has shaped current forest 
conditions and management 
practices in the userâ€™s SFM 
area. It also provides guidance 
on documenting any current 
adaptations to climate change 
that the user may already be 
practicing.

This chapter provides guidance 
on developing and describing 
future climate and forest 
impact scenarios.

This chapter provides 
guidance on evaluating and 
documenting SFM vulnerability 
to current climate and the 
range of future climate change 
scenarios.

5.  Adaptation 

options

This chapter provides guidance 
on developing climate change 
adaptation options for SFM.

6.  Implementation 

and 
mainstreaming 
of adaptation 

This chapter provides guidance 
on implementing and 
mainstreaming adaptation for 
SFM.

a Each chapter corresponds to one of the six components of adaptation framework for adaptation to climate change, as presented in Figure 2 in Williamson et al. (2012). 
b SFM = sustainable forest management.
