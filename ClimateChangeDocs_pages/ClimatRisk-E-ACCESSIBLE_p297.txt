WIND 

Active transportation infrastructure tends to be less vulnerable to structural impacts than road 
and transit systems, due to the absence of heavy, motorized traffic. However, elevated portions of 
walkways and bikeways, as well as signage, can be damaged by high winds during extreme weather 
events (OFCM, 2002). Strong winds are also associated with lower levels of cycling (Koatse and 
Rietveld, 2009). High winds will also pose a safety hazard to cyclist and pedestrians, due to flying and 
falling debris.

OPPORTUNITIES

Warmer winters with less snow in many Canadian cities will provide longer seasonal access to walking 
and cycling infrastructure. Some Northern cities view climate risks to roadway infrastructure as an 
opportunity to enhance active modes. Whitehorse, for instance, has placed significant emphasis on 
active transportation in recent years and invested in high-profile cycling facilities. This is, in part, due to 
a projected increase in the length of the season in which cycling and walking is possible for most trips 
(Transport Canada, 2011).
