3.4 MARINE 

British Columbia has three international ports, four regional ports, and 40 local ports (see Figure 6 for 
principle ports).  Port Metro Vancouver is Canada’s largest and busiest marine port, representing trade 
in excess of $187 billion annually with more than 160 countries (Port Metro Vancouver, 2014), and 
adding approximately $10.5 billion to the national economy (Government of British Columbia, 2011a). 
The three container ports in Vancouver, Prince Rupert and Nanaimo are interconnected with rail 
and road systems, as are major ports at Kitimat and Squamish. The ports of Stewart, Port Alberi, and 
Victoria have only road connections. Prince Rupert is the terminus of the Pacific Gateway Northern 
Corridor with capacity of 750,000 TEUs – container shipments are measured in 20-foot equivalent units, 
or TEUs, which represent one standard-sized shipping container (Government of British Columbia, 
2011b; World Bank Group, 2016)). Vancouver is the terminus of the Pacific Gateway Southern Corridor 
handling upwards of 2.9 million TEUs of container traffic annually (Port Metro Vancouver, 2015a).

In 2010, the province’s marine ports handled:

•  85 million tonnes of cargo traffic; and

•  2.86 million TEUs of container traffic (Government of British Columbia, 2011c).

Principal exports, by tonnage were coal, forest products, grain, potash, petroleum products, and 
metals, minerals, and chemicals.  Principal imports included: automobiles, household goods, 
construction materials, machinery, produce, base metals, and beverages. British Columbia’s marine 
ports also handle a significant volume of passenger traffic.  For example, in 2014 the Port of Vancouver 
handled 812,000 cruise ship passengers (Port Metro Vancouver, 2015b).

Ferries are another key element of the province’s marine transportation system.  7.7 million vehicles 
were transported by ferry through the province’s ferry system in 2014, representing 19.8 million 
passengers on 171,000 sailings (British Columbia Ferry Services Inc., 2015). BC Ferries, formerly a 
crown corporation and now a commercial organization, has 35 vessels and 47 ports of call providing 
passenger and cargo services to coastal locations in British Columbia. Ferry connections to the United 
States from British Columbia include the Alaska Marine Highway System, providing transport between 
Prince Rupert and South East Alaska.  In the South, vessels between British Columbia and Washington 
State provide service to coastal and island locations. Inland Ferries transport passengers and cargo 
across rivers and lakes on the mainland. Other vessels such as water taxis also provide transport to 
various locations.

The next section discusses historic climate impacts, future climate risks and adaptation practices as 
they relate to road, rail, air and marine transport in British Columbia.  Discussion of historic impacts 
includes several case studies of specific climate events.
