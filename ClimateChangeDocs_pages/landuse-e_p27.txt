Halifax Harbour plan for sea level rise68,69
Halifax (population 390 000), the capital of Nova Scotia, is a major seaport with significant industrial, military and 
municipal infrastructure on the coast. Rising sea level, along with increased storm intensity and associated waves 
and storm surges, presents risks to residents, property and infrastructure in coastal areas of the city. To respond 
to these impacts, in 2006 the city recognized the need to gather scientific data on sea level rise, storm surges and 
vulnerability to inform development of an area-specific land use plan for Halifax Harbour.
City planners partnered with a team of scientists to develop projections of future sea levels and storm water levels 
in Halifax Harbour under three climate scenarios for 2100: (1) a continuation of the historical rate of change, (2) the 
upper-limit projection for mean sea level rise from the fourth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel 
on Climate Change (IPCC) and (3) a projection based on more recent scientific literature. High-resolution mapping 
of possible future flood levels was then produced for each scenario. Following a presentation by scientists and 
city staff, Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM) Council in 2010 chose scenario 2c as a policy reference point from 
which to develop the adaptation strategy. HRM is also committed to re-examining this choice when additional 
scientific information becomes available. This example demonstrates that credible climate projections, based 
on best available science that are communicated to the public and decision makers in a format that is easily 
understandable, provide a helpful foundation for adaptation action at the municipal level.
