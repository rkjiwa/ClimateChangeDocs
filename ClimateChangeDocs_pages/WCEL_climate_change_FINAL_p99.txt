Transportation systems and connectivity  
(Roads, trails, railways, airports, marine transportation, communications, utilities, etc.)

 F Has the community engaged in a climate change assessment process that has identified 

vulnerabilities, quantified risk, and decided on priority areas for action with respect to 
transportation systems and connectivity?

 F Is the local road network vulnerable to climate-related emergencies (e.g. increased risk of 

flooding or wildfire) or longer-term gradual impacts (e.g. sea level rise)?

 F Are there specific assets such as bridges and culverts that are particularly vulnerable to 

climate change impacts?

 F Are there pipes or conduits located under or alongside bridges that need to be relocated?

 F Is consultation and coordination required with other authorities and operators (e.g. Ministry 

of Transportation and Infrastructure, railway companies, port authorities)?

 F Will more freeze-thaw cycles or increased summer temperatures result in higher 

maintenance demands for roads and sidewalks?

 F In the event of a climate-related emergency (e.g. flooding) will there be impacts on the 

transportation network?

 F Are there secure emergency access and evacuation routes?

 F Will there be missing transportation links, gaps or dead end roads?

 F Are any emergency facilities likely to be cut off during a climate-related emergency 
(e.g. fire, emergency, ambulance, police/RCMP, helicopter pads, public works yard, 
coast guard station)? If so, do they need to move over the long term or is there an 
alternative access (i.e. right of way)?

 F Would the transportation system function well if there was more than one extreme 
event happening at the same time (e.g. windstorm and flooding)? Will the transport 
of food and supplies, as well as business continuity (e.g. transport of industrial and 
commercial goods, employee travel to and from work) be affected?

 F Are gas, diesel and electrical vehicle fueling stations and distribution facilities at risk?

 F Are there back-up options/plans for hydro, gas and telecommunications in the event of 

disruptions (e.g. generators or solar facilities for running and recharging communications 
devices such as cell phones and radios)?

 F Is there an up-to-date emergency plan in place for transportation (with contacts, phone 

numbers and protocols)?
