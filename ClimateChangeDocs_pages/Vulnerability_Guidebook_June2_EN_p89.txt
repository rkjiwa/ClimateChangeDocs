1.2-C.      Human elements of the SFM system (actors and their 

decision-making scope)

List the organizations and individuals involved in planning and operations in your SFM 
system and describe the role of each individual (e.g., prepares plans, approves plans, 
provides advice, supervises operations, monitors operations).  

Decisions about managing forest resources will affect a wide range of other values that 
society derives from the forest. Therefore, you may also want to consider who will be 
affected by these decisions, so you can invite them to participate in the assessment or 
keep them informed of progress and outcomes. Having other interested parties (e.g., 
stakeholders) involved or kept informed from the outset can be of assistance if you wish to 
try new SFM options.

The human elements of an SFM system may include (but are not limited to) the following: 

 

 

 

 

 

•   agencies involved in overall land management or organizations that partner in the 

management of the area

•   agencies involved in reviewing or approving plans for compliance and enforcement

•   organizations holding land-use tenures 

•   any organization that can affect decisions for the area

•   any organization or individuals that may be affected by decisions for the area
