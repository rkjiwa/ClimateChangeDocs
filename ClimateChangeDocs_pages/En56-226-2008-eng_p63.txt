APPENDIX 1

appendix 1: methods

The following methods can be used during climate change
impacts and adaptation assessments at the local or regional
scale2. 

Brainstorming

Brainstorming is a popular technique used to generate ideas
in a group. The basic rules of brainstorming include a focus
on generating many ideas without evaluating the merits of
those  ideas—critical  judgment  of  ideas  is  reserved  for  a
subsequent step in the process. Accordingly, unusual ideas are
welcome,  and  there  is  an  emphasis  on  building  on  and
extending proposed ideas to come up with ever more creative
possibilities (e.g. see What-if analyses)

The  Pacific  Northwest  region  in  the  United  States  faces
critical challenges to a mainly hydroelectric energy supply as
summer river flows decrease. In response to this problem, the
University of Washington’s Climate Impacts Group brought
together utilities, government agencies and regional planning
bodies  for  brainstorming  sessions  to  develop  ideas  about
possible ways to mitigate projected power shortages for the
region (Harden and Eilperin 2006). 

Case study 

The case study is an approach to investigate complex social
phenomena within a real-life context, and can be used to
explore, describe or explain an observed situation. The use of
case studies is commonly to answer “how” or “why” questions
about contemporary events where an understanding of how
the  context  relates  to  observed  outcomes  is  desired  (Yin
2004). For example, case studies exploring the experiences of
other local governments with designing and implementing
climate change adaptation strategies could provide valuable
insight into opportunities and constraints for your context.
This strategy can provide insight into how a real-life system
may react to climate change impacts or variability and to
adaptation policies.

Case studies are often included as part of developing novel
policy areas that an organization may have limited experience
with. A current project by the Canadian Institute of Planners
and Natural Resources Canada is using a set of local case
studies  to  find  better  ways  of  integrating  scientific
information into the policy and planning process, and to
suggest best practices for use in climate change adaptation
planning by municipalities in Canada (Canadian Institute of
Planners 2008).

Assessment of the cost of adaptation 

For our purposes, the cost of adaptation refers to the cost of
planned  policy  initiatives  designed  to  respond  to  climate
change  impacts,  and  does  not  include  unplanned  or
individual adaptive actions. A combination of other methods
discussed in this document can contribute to this assessment
of  the  cost  of  adaptation  to  climate  change,  and  this
assessment begins by considering three questions: Adapt to
what? Who or what adapts? And, how does adaptation occur?
(Smit et al. 1999). To answer the first question one needs to
have an idea of how conditions will change – for example,
scenarios or storylines are needed to frame further analysis. In
terms of who or what adapts, the system of interest needs to
be  defined.  Are  you  interested  in  looking  at  the  entire
municipality? A particular sector or type of infrastructure?
Finally, costs of adaptation depend critically on the strategies
chosen and the net costs or benefits of those measures. These
should be considered alongside the net costs or benefits of
projected climate change impacts, and the degree to which
adaptation measures will provide adequate responses to those
impacts (see Assessments of the cost of inaction).
