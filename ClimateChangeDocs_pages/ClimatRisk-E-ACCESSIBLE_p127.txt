Trends in extreme weather in the Prairies are also important. Research suggests that May-June 
precipitation over the southeastern Prairies has increased significantly since the 1990s, possibly 
explaining observed changes in runoff patterns and recent extreme flood events (e.g. 2011 and 2014) 
(Szeto et al., 2015). 

3.2 PROJECTIONS

Temperatures in the Prairies are projected to rise under all climate scenarios, with associated changes 
in evapotranspiration leading to increased aridity in many areas (Sauchyn and Kulshreshtha, 2008). 
Under a low-emissions scenario, warming will increase only slightly from historic trends; however, under 
a high-emissions scenario, increases exceeding 6˚C are possible this century (Bush et al., 2014). The 
greatest warming will continue to be experienced in winter, with the least occurring during summer.  

Figure 6:  Projected changes in sea level for 
Churchill, Manitoba. Under almost all 
scenarios, sea level will fall as a result of glacial 
isostatic adjustments, despite the fact that 
global sea level will continue to rise. See 
Atkinson et al. (2016) for scenario descriptions 
and James et al. (2014) for projected sea-level 
changes by decade. (Source: Natural 
Resources Canada)

Projections of precipitation changes show 
total precipitation increasing over the northern 
Prairies, with relatively minor changes projected 
for southern areas (Bush et al., 2014). Again 
changes are more significant under higher-
emission scenarios. In the southwestern 
Prairies, decreases in summer precipitation are 
projected under high-emission scenarios. While 
the southern Prairies have been identified as a 
region with a higher likelihood of experiencing 
more frequent drought in future (Bonsal et al., 
2013), there is no strong agreement between 
projections of various climate models (Bush 
et al., 2014). Instances of extreme rainfall 
are likely to increase in tandem with warmer 
temperatures, while instances of freezing rain 
are likely to increase while snow cover declines 
over the 21st century (Kharin and Zwiers, 2000; 
Bush et al., 2014).

Sea level changes are important for the Port of 
Churchill. Currently, the land at Churchill is rising 
at a rate of 9.3 mm/year, a product of glacial 
isostatic adjustment as the earth’s crust responds 
to the melting of the ice sheets more than 10,000 
years ago (Atkinson et al., 2016). This strong 
vertical uplift means that sea level at Churchill 
will continue to fall through the current century, 
despite rising global sea level. The projected 
range of sea-level decline at Churchill is about 
35 to 40 cm by 2050, and 60 to 80 cm by 2100, 
although a decrease of more than 1 m is possible 
by 2100 (James et al., 2014) (Figure 6). Even 
under a very high global sea-level rise scenario, 
sea level at Churchill would not likely rise by more 
than a few centimeters.
