1.8 PHYSICAL ACTIVITY
As the climate changes, various impacts on the ability to be physically active, as well as 
impacts on those who are being physically active, are in evidence. Conditions that are known 
to be associated with physical activity, such as obesity, pulmonary and cardiac health, and 
mental health are thus being influenced both directly and indirectly by climate change. 
Outdoor activities can be limited by increased heat and air pollution (36). Longer-term shifts in 
environmental conditions, such as shorter seasons with snow and ice, can both provide 
opportunities for some outdoor activities (hiking, walking, cycling) or decrease others and their 
hazards (skiing, snowmobiling; sunburns, avalanche risk). A significant source of climate 
change comes from private motor vehicles emissions and home energy expenditure (e.g. 
home heating and cooling). Urban planning, which supports more compact living and 
sustainable transportation such as transit and active transportation, would reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions and encourage greater physical activity and its associated health benefits (37). 
As a result, benefits from policies and programs aimed at mitigating climate change at the 
individual level, and particularly in the transportation sector, also have the benefit of increasing 
active transportation and as a result physical activity levels (38).
