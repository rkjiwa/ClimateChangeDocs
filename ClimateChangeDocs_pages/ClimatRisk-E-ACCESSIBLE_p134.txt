in remote northern communities. If ice is not thick enough for transit by mid-January, a modal shift 
from trucks to aviation for essential goods is required, at great expense to all users (Taylor and Parry, 
2014). When ice roads eventually open in mild winters, load restrictions can be applied (CBC News, 
2012b). Recent winter-road experiences in Manitoba are discussed in Case Study 3.

CASE STUDY 3: WINTER ROADS IN MANITOBA

Manitoba has the majority of the Prairies’ winter roads (78 percent of winter road km), serving 30,000 
people in 28 remote communities (Taylor and Parry, 2014). In Northern Manitoba, winters from 1998 to 2003 
and 2009 to 2012 featured below-average operating seasons on most roads (Taylor and Parry, 2014; Table 
1). Between 2007 and 2011, the average cost of the winter-road network rose to $13 million annually, and 
funding for winter roads has tripled since 1998 (Rabson, 2012; Manitoba Infrastructure and Transportation, 
2011). In 2012, the province’s 2500 km network opened several weeks later than normal, prompting 
Northern Chiefs to declare a state of emergency (CBC News, 2012b). 

Despite a decline in season length from 2009 to 2012, data for routes in Manitoba (Table 1) suggest 
operating windows have recovered in recent years. Seasons from 2013 to 2015 slightly exceeded the 
12-season average from 2003 to 2015 (48 operational days). Over this period, MIT recorded opening and 
closing dates for up to 50 distinct road segments operated in the major East Side Lake Winnipeg (ESLW) 
area. Routings were frequently changed, often to move the roads off ice-covered waterways and onto 
land routes (Taylor and Parry, 2014). Routing changes presented some challenges in efforts to quantify 
winter-road operating days, but these changes likely extended operational seasons for many routes. A shift 
towards more land-based roads has also offered greater safety during construction, maintenance, and 
use (Taylor and Parry, 2014). However, operating days are not the only relevant variable – many factors are 
involved in determining the relative success of different winter road seasons in moving goods to remote 
areas in recent years.  These include routing changes, the polar vortex breakup of 2013-2014, varying 
weight restrictions, frost depth, snow cover, etc. 

Future projections estimate average loss to the province’s future ice-road season at eight days by the 
2020s, 15 days by mid-century, and 21 days by the 2080s (Sauchyn and Kulshreshtha, 2008). In light of 
these expected impacts, more drastic adaptation efforts – beyond shifting routes from waterways to land 
– are being made to improve reliability, particularly for remote communities.  For example, Manitoba is 
undertaking a large-scale infrastructure program ($3 billion over 30 years) to build permanent, all-weather 
roads in the ESLW area to serve remote communities with a collective population of approximately 
36,000 individuals (Manitoba East Side Road Authority, n.d.). The proposed routing of this network closely 
approximates the current winter-road network. While the rationale for this undertaking is multi-faceted, the 
following supportive statement was made by the Eastside Road Authority “ … over the years, the reliability 
and length of time that the winter roads are open has been lessening, resulting in hardships for local 
residents” (Manitoba East Side Road Authority, n.d.). 

Other potential adaptations being considered include shifts to modes less costly than conventional 
aviation such as, enhanced rail and ferry services (Manitoba Infrastructure and Transportation Staff, 
Government of Manitoba, personal communication, 2015). Manitoba Infrastructure and Transportation 
currently operates four ferries during open-water season. These ferries serve remote communities reliant 
on winter roads, in the areas of South Indian Lake, Split Lake, York Landing, Bloodvein, and Norway 
House (Taylor and Parry, 2014). Others have proposed airships as a potential substitute for ice roads 
and conventional aviation (CBC News, 2015b).
