Toronto’s Draft Design Guidelines for “Greening” Surface Parking Lots45
The City of Toronto developed guidelines for green parking lot design with the goal of improving the urban design 
and environmental performance of surface parking lots within city boundaries. Traditionally, parking lot design 
has been based mainly on functional criteria (to maximize parking lot spaces and minimize maintenance costs) 
with little regard to the quality of the urban design or environmental performance. The new guidelines provide 
design options and strategies, in both graphic and written form, to meet the following objectives: enhance the 
safety and attractiveness of the public realm, provide shade and high-quality landscaping, reduce the urban 
heat island effect, manage storm-water quality and quantity on-site, and incorporate sustainable material and 
technologies. All proposals for new parking lots within city limits, both public and private, must consider the 
guidelines before receiving development approval. The guidelines also help developers comply with the Toronto 
Green Standard. Although not designed explicitly as a climate change adaptation measure, the application of the 
guidelines, particularly the urban heat island and storm-water management measures, increase the city’s resilience 
to climate change.
