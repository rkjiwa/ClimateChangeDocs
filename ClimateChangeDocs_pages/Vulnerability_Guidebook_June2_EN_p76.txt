6.3.2     The Practice 
Mainstreaming adaptation into day-to-day operations requires integrating priority 
adaptations into ongoing planning and operational procedures. This can be accomplished 
by developing a mainstreaming plan for each priority adaptation. If appropriate, 
individual plans can be combined into a comprehensive mainstreaming plan with 
strategic, operational, and adaptive capacity components. Worksheet 6.3 (Implement 
[mainstream] recommended adaptations) provides a template to aid you in preparing 
your mainstreaming plans. For each recommended adaptation, the follow actions are 
suggested: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

•   Assess the jurisdiction within which the adaptation actions fall and the roles and 

responsibilities of various agencies and individuals in implementation.

•   Identify the actions required to implement the adaptation (e.g., changes in planning, 

procedures, policies, regulations, legislation, investments, protocols, guidelines, 
training, and operational methods).

•   Identify opportunities to mainstream the adaptation into regular business 

processes.

•   Identify roles and responsibilities (i.e., the specific person or department that will 

lead implementation and other individuals or departments that should be involved). 
Set deadlines for implementation progress.

•   Assess the internal support required for implementation to proceed (e.g., 

operational staff, specialists, senior management, political leaders). 

•   Assess the external support required for implementation to proceed (e.g., 

involvement or buy-in from other organizations).

•   Identify the human resources required for implementation to proceed and assess 

whether these resources are available or if they must be secured.

•   Assess information and/or training needs that may be required to implement the 

adaptation.

•   Identify the financial resources required for implementation to proceed and assess 

whether these resources are available or if they must be secured. 

•   Describe what successful implementation would look like (e.g., all planning and 

operations staff are knowledgeable about climate change impacts and adaptation; 
silvicultural operations reflect changes in precipitation). 

•   Identify the overall schedule, the timing of specific events, and the milestones 

associated with implementation.

•   Determine if there is a need to communicate with decision makers, other staff, or 

interested parties about the adaptation and its potential implications.

•   Determine if there is an existing monitoring or tracking plan into which this 

adaptation should be incorporated. 

•   Consider whether the adaptation can help to achieve other non-SFM objectives or 

goals.
