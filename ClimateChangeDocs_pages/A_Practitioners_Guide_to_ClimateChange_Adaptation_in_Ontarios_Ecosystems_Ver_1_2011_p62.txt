The Lake Simcoe Climate Change Adaptation Strategy 

The  commitment  contained  in  the  Lake  Simcoe  Protection  Plan  led  to  the  development  of  a  climate  change  adaptation  strategy  for  the  Lake 
Simcoe watershed. The Ministry of the Environment continues its work to complete the Lake Simcoe Climate Change Adaptation Strategy, and it 
is hoped that a draft will be available by the spring of 2012. To follow the progress on the strategy, refer to the Ministry of Environment’s website.
