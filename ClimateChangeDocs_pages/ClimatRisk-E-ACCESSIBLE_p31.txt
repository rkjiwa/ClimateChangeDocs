EXAMPLES OF IMPACTS ON 

MARINE TRANSPORT

① Flooding and/or damage to port 

facilities

② Increased or reduced access to 

ports, dredging requirements 

CLIMATE FACTOR(S)

 • Extreme precipitation (heavy rainfall) and associated standing 

water

 • Storm surges/sea level rise, erosion in coastal areas
 • Freezing rain (ice-scour damage on dock structures and visual 

navigational aids) 

 • Low water levels (damage and accelerated decay of 

exposed infrastructure)

 • Increasing sea levels (e.g., Atlantic Canada and British 

Columbia) permitting entry of heavier vessels (deeper drafts)   

 • High water levels inhibiting passage of vessels under bridges
 • Decreasing sea levels (e.g., Hudson Bay) and lower freshwater 

levels (e.g., Great Lakes) inhibiting access by heavier vessels 

③ Hazards to vessel navigation – 
storms and wind events (waves)

 • Wave action (difficulty maneuvering vessels)
 • Melting sea ice (open water worsening the impact of storms 

and wind events)

④ Hazards to vessel navigation – 

detached sea ice

⑤ Longer or shorter shipping season 

⑥ New navigation opportunities 

 • Melting ice (detached sea ice moving into unexpected 

areas)

 • Earlier ice break-up/later freeze-up (longer navigation 

season), later ice break-up/earlier freeze-up (shorter season)
 • Melting sea ice (creating open water where navigation was 

previously not possible)
