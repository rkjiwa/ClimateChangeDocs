2. Questions for a plumber
In many cases, it is the more substantive measures that are the most
effective way to reduce basement "ooding. Many of these require the
assistance of a licensed plumber. Municipal governments often require
permits for the plumbing and drainage improvements described in this
document. Talk to your municipal government to make sure you or
the person you have hired have the proper permits.

Is poor grading causing my !ooding? 
The slope of your yard is very important to keep water away from your
home and foundation. This helps keep the basement dry. You should:
• Check your lot to see if your yard slopes away from your home. Look
everywhere, including under stairs and decks.
The soil directly beside your foundation wall
should be approximately 10 cm to 15 cm
higher than the soil 1.5 metres away from the
foundation.

• If you notice that the ground close to the

foundation of your house has settled beside
your foundation wall, !ll it in with a solid,
compactable soil – like clay – so that there is 
a constant slope away from the foundation.

• Talk to the department in your municipal government that is

responsible for building inspections and stormwater drainage about
swales (the grassy depressions that help direct water away from
homes) and lot grading. Ask them where swales should be on your
property, and where water from your lot should be directed.

Do I have a weeping tile?
A weeping tile or foundation drain is an underground perforated pipe
that runs along the bottom of a home’s foundation. Older Canadian
homes, for example those built before the 1940s or 1950s, may not
have foundation drains. If you !nd that your home does not have a
foundation drain and you experience serious in!ltration "ooding, you
should consider having a foundation drain installed.
