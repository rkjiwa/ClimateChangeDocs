The project integrated Indigenous Knowledge on climate 
change, human health risks, and suspected contaminated 
sites with site-specific community-based monitoring plans. 
The Yukon River Inter-Tribal Watershed Council (YRITWC) 
collaborated with five Yukon First Nations including Selkirk, 
Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in, Kluane, White River and Carcross / 
Tagish. 

This project examined the plant foods that have 
traditionally contributed to a healthy and diverse diet 
throughout the year for northern indigenous people.
