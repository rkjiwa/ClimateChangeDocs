2.2  EXPECTED FUTURE CHANGES IN TEMPERATURE AND PRECIPITATION  

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has developed three scenarios for future 
temperature changes for Polar Regions. All scenarios show both an increase in temperature and 
its variability. Temperature is projected to increase by more than 2°C over the next 50 years in 
Yukon (Streicker, 2016). Winters are projected to warm faster than any other season (IPCC, 
2014).   

Precipitation is projected to increase by 10% to 20% over the next 50 years in Yukon. All 
scenarios project a significant increase in precipitation. In practical terms, this means that 
precipitation is expected to become more variable and increase in summer months. Snow fall is 
projected to come later in the fall, become more variable with periods of little snow, and it is 
likely that intense snow-fall events will be more common (Streicker, 2016). 

These expected continuing changes in temperature and precipitation matter to Yukoners as they 
will need to cope with, and adapt to changes in local environments, impacts on community 
infrastructure built on permafrost areas, more extreme rain events and associated floods.  

For more detail on how Yukon’s climate has changed and how it is expected to change in the 
future see APPENDIX A at the end of this report.
