oBjeCtiVe 4.1: minimiZe Per CaPita water ConSumPtion

the greenest City Action plan includes a target of reducing per capita water 
consumption by 33% below 2006 levels. 

4.1.1 Primary aCtion: water ConSerVation (in ProgreSS)

Water conservation actions in the greenest City Action plan include water 
metering and enhanced water education, incentives and conservation programs.

4.1.2 Primary aCtion: SuPPort the extreme hot weather  
Committee in ComPletion of PhaSe ii of Planning anD exPanD 
the hot weather PrePareDneSS work Program.

the City’s extreme Hot Weather Committee completed phase i of planning 
in 2011, including development of a heat alert and a ‘Be Cool’ communication 
campaign. the second phase of work is focused on actions to minimize  
impacts of heat on health, especially within vulnerable populations. Leveraging  
and adding support to the existing work program will ensure Vancouver 
matches the efforts of other Canadian cities in planning for heat. 
the following are some of the short and midterm actions and tasks under 
the extreme hot weather preparedness work program:
•   increase resources to support an expanded program including additional 

staff time from Sustainability. 

•   Complete urban heat island effect mapping. Coordinate with parks on 

targeting green space and trees in hot areas.

•   Work with the Coastal Communities at risk research group on vulnerable 

population mapping. 

•   develop policies for cool refuges and cooling capacity in civic facilities. 

Assess cooling capacity of facilities within identified hot spots and prioritize 
for early policy implementation. 

•   research and explore options for transporting those in need to cool facilities 

during heat events.

impacts: water supply shortages in late summer, increasing respiratory illness, 
health and safety risks for vulnerable populations.
what this could mean: during extreme heat events, health risks from direct 
impacts such as heat stroke increase, and many people with underlying health 
conditions will experience a worsening of their condition. the heat wave 
in 2009 in Vancouver caused an estimated 122 ‘excess deaths’ and many 
emergency room visits. Vancouverites are generally less acclimatized to 
high temperatures and therefore have a lower threshold for health effects. 
Vulnerable populations such as older adults, infants and children, those with 
chronic illness and socially disadvantaged communities are also at higher risk. 
the north Shore snowpack has decreased by over 20% in the last fifty years 
and is predicted to be almost non-existent by the year 2080. An increase in 
annual rainfall will help offset the decrease in source water for our drinking 
reservoirs but longer, drier summers may result in late summer water supply 
pressure.
