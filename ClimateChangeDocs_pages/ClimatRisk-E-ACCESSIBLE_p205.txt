3.2 MORE INTENSE PRECIPITATION EVENTS

Total annual precipitation from observed data shows significant upward trends for many of the 
weather stations located in the south of the province. For some of these stations, the trends are 
associated with increases in spring and fall precipitation.

Increases in precipitation are expected in winter and spring throughout Québec. In the northern 
and more central regions, this would also be the case in the summer and fall seasons. As in the case 
of temperatures, these increases will be more significant for extreme precipitation events than for 
averages. In fact, all climate models agree on future upward trends for extreme precipitation events, 
everywhere in Québec, although these changes are more substantial moving northward. This applies 
for maximum annual amounts in addition to all durations and frequencies. For example, a maximum 
annual rainfall event with a 20-year return period over the 1986-2005 timeframe could occur more 
frequently by 2046-2065 with a return period of around 7 to 10 years. Preliminary studies suggest that 
future climate conditions could be more conducive to thunderstorms, which are usually accompanied 
by larger quantities of precipitation, although the robustness of these projections is uncertain.
For winter precipitation, the proportion of snow and rainfall relative to total accumulation depends 
on temperature. Given that the climate has been warming in the recent past, downward snow 
precipitation trends are already being observed in the south of Québec. An analysis of several 
different data sources reveals that snow cover duration has decreased by approximately 2 days per 
decade in the south of Québec between 1948 and 2005.

Even if snowfall events decrease due to a shorter cold season, rainfall events during this season should 
increase with warming temperatures in winter (see Figure 6). Changes in snow cover with respect 
to these trends will vary according to the region, altitude, climatic regime, type of surface and 
vegetation. Compared to the 1970-1999 average, snow cover duration by 2041-2070 could decrease 
by up to 25 days in the North of Québec, from 25 to 45 days in the central region, from 45 to 75 days 
for the Gulf of the St. Lawrence and between 45 and 65 days for the south of Québec.

February) precipitation for the period 1971-2000 (left panel) and projected (right panels) for the 2050 
horizon (2041-2070).  The observed average is calculated using the CRU TS 3.21 dataset (CRU TS = 
Climatic Research Unit Timeseries, 3.21 dataset is the name of the release). Future maps present the 
ensemble median (i.e. the median of all available projections) as well as the 10th and 90th percentiles 
(i.e., lower and higher bounds) of 19 future climate scenarios. Future climate scenarios were produced 
using the “delta” method calculated from the using CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 
Phase 5) simulations (RCP 8.5) applied to the observed data (see Charron, 2014). (Source: Ouranos)
