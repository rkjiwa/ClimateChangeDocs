Vulnerability Assessment Guidance
 

•   The United Nations Environment Programme’s Programme of Research on Climate 

Change Vulnerability, Impacts and Adaptation (also known as PROVIA) recently 
published detailed guidance on conducting vulnerability assessment (Hinkel et 
al. 2013). This excellent, highly recommended resource highlights and suggests 
methods, approaches, and decision trees appropriate at various points in the 
assessment process:

tabid/130752/Default.aspx.

 

•   “A Practitioner’s Guide to Climate Change Adaptation in Ontario’s Ecosystems” 

(Gleeson et al. 2011) provides vulnerability and risk assessment guidance for natural 
resources managers in Ontario. The Ontario guide is based on a draft version of the 
current guidebook: https://www.ontario.ca/environment-and-energy/practitioners-
guide-climate-change-adaptation-ontarios-ecosystems-ver-1-2011.

 

•   U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service recently produced two adaptation 

guidance documents that target forest managers in the United States – “Forest 
Adaptation Resources: Climate Change Tools and Approaches for Land Managers” 
(Swanston and Janowiak 2012): http://www.nrs.fs.fed.us/pubs/gtr/gtr_nrs87.pdf, 
and “Responding to Climate Change in National Forests: A Guidebook for Developing 
Adaptation Options” (Peterson et al. 2011): http://www.fs.fed.us/pnw/pubs/pnw_
gtr855.pdf.

 

•   “Scanning the Conservation Horizon: A Guide to Climate Change Vulnerability 

Assessment” (Glick et al. 2011) provides good background on vulnerability assessment 
methodology for conservation resource professionals: http://www.nwf.org/
vulnerabilityguide.

 

•   The use of workshops is one of the most widely used approaches to conducting 

impact, vulnerability, and adaptation assessments. Halofsky et al. (2011a) have 
documented a workshop approach for developing climate change adaptation 
and action strategies for natural resource managers: http://www.fs.fed.us/psw/
publications/millar/psw_2011_millar001(halofsky).pdf. 
A workshop approach is also highlighted by Janowiak et al. (2011): http://www.nrs.
fs.fed.us/pubs/gtr/gtr_nrs81.pdf.
