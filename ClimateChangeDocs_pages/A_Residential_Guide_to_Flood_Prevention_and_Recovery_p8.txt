How can basements flood?
Wastewater Back-up Flooding
Wastewater backup flooding typically occurs because of a 
blockage in the wastewater lateral leading to the trunk sewer. 
Most often the blockage is caused by tree roots. On occasion 
it can be due to solidified grease, paper or other items getting 
caught in the lateral. On rare occasions, a wastewater backup is 
the result of a broken lateral, which can also cause a blockage.

Reduce the risk
• Have a drainage contractor visit your home to inspect your 

lateral with a Closed Circuit TV (CCTV).

• Never pour kitchen grease, fats or oils into your house drains 
because they may solidify in your plumbing system. Also, do 
not put objects down the toilet or drains that your plumbing 
system was never intended to handle.

• Consider a sanitary wastewater backflow preventer valve  

to reduce the risk of sewage backup into your basement.
• Disconnect roof downspouts, if connected to wastewater 

lateral, to reduce flows to the sanitary lateral and the 
wastewater sewer.

Backwater valve: A 
mechanical device that 
prevents wastewater from 
an overloaded sewer from 
backing up into your home. 
The backwater valve allows 
wastewater to flow from your 
home during normal use. 
When properly maintained, 
it will close automatically if 
wastewater backs up from the 
sewer main towards your home 
(reversal mode), protecting 
your basement from the 
potential flooding.
Swale: A grassy, ditch-like 
depression used to direct 
stormwater flows and  
absorbs water.

Kitchen grease,  
fats and oils should  
be discarded in  
your GreenCart.
Although convenient 
items such as baby 
and toddler training 
wipes are labelled  
as flushable, they 
commonly cause 
blockages.

about items that 
should not go into 
your sink or toilet
