A  preliminary  review  and  evaluation  of  the  residual  water  levels  resulting  from  these  stations  is 
provided in the support materials provided in Appendix D. 
Regional Meteorological Effects 
A preliminary review of the residual water levels achieved at each station (Appendix D) indicates 
that the general characteristics of residual water levels can be summarized on a regional basis as 
follows: 
  West Coast Vancouver Island – Juan de Fuca Strait and Georgia Strait:  
  Central Coast – Queen Charlotte Islands – North Coast:  
The larger residual water levels recorded at the Tofino and Prince Rupert tide gauge locations are 
shown in Figure 3-2, which shows the peak water level after the predicted tide is removed.  For 
clarity  the  only  events  shown  are  those  over  a  threshold  chosen  so  that  at  least  one  event  is 
present for every year of record.  A review of the higher events from each data set confirmed that 
the events were not spikes, with limited (one or two hours) duration above the threshold, and that 
they correspond to known severe storms on the coast. 
A preliminary extreme value analysis of the available data sets at Tofino and Prince Rupert, using a 
Peak  over  Threshold  extreme  value  methodology,  after  ensuring  that  at  least  72  hours  exists 
between  each  event,  and  after  considering  the  effect  of  various  threshold  values,  gives  the 
estimates  of  expected  residual  water  levels  for  a  range  of  annual  exceedance  probabilities  (or 
return periods) summarized in Table 3-3. 
A  comparison  of  inter-station  residual  time  series  during  large  events  indicates  that  the  peak 
residual  values  vary  approximately  ±  0.1  m  among  the  stations  within  the  two  groups  indicated 
above.
