In 2015, the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) released a white paper providing considerable detail on adapting
infrastructure and civil engineering practice to a changing climate https://ascelibrary.org/doi/pdf/10.1061/9780784479193 . The
executive summary describes the purpose and scope of this document as follows:

The purpose of the white paper is to:

»

»

»

foster understanding and transparency of analytical methods necessary to update and describe climate, including
possible changes in the frequency and intensity of weather and extreme events and for planning and engineering
design of the built and natural environments

identify (and evaluate) methods to assess impacts and vulnerabilities caused by changing climate conditions on the
built and natural environments

promote communication of best practices in civil engineering practice for addressing uncertainties associated with
changing development and conditions at the project scale, including climate, weather, extreme environments and the
nature and extent of the built and natural environments”

It consists of the following sections:

Section 2: “Review of climate science for engineering practice,” provides an overview of the current knowledge of
climate and weather science, as well as its limitations and relevance to engineering practice.

Section 3: “Incorporating climate science into engineering practice,” presents the challenges of incorporating climate
change and weather science into engineering practice.

Section 4: “Civil engineering sectors,” reviews the impacts of climate change on specific sectors, including codes and
standards that may be affected and recommendations for action.

Section 5: “Research, Development and Demonstration needs,” proposes research and other activities to advance civil
engineering practices and standards to effectively address climate change impacts.

Section 6, “Summary, Conclusions and Recommendations,” concludes the white paper with a discussion on near-term
decision making and recommendations for research, development and implementation of improved practices”.

Engineers active in planning and implementing adaptation actions are encouraged to consult this paper for the background
science of climate and to gain further understanding of the issues facing engineers and what can be done to address them.
