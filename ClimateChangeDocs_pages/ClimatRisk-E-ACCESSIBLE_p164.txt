Figure 5b: Temperature changes for Ontario in winter (December, January, and February) under RCP 
2.5 (low-emissions scenario), RCP 4.5 (intermediate-emissions scenario), and RCP 8.5 (high-
emissions scenario) for 2046-2065, as compared to baseline years 1986-2005. (Source: Environment 
and Climate Change Canada)

Figures 5a and 5b suggest that warming is projected to continue in all three sub-regions under all 
future scenarios, with the most drastic increases expected in Northern Ontario during winter. Projected 
precipitation changes show greater variability, with annual increases in all three sub-regions but 
seasonal (summer) decreases projected in Central and Southern Ontario under some scenarios. While 
not captured in the preceding tables and figures, average daily wind speed is projected to increase 
throughout the province (Cheng et al., 2012b).
