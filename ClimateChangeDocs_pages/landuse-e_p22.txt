3.0 Decision-support tools

Decision-support tools are designed to assist decision 
makers in the process of developing and implementing 
climate change adaptation plans and policies. This section 
describes five decision-support tools that are particularly 
relevant to planners and local officials involved in the 
preparation and implementation of plans and measures 
that address climate change adaptation. Many of the tools 
described here help planners to translate scientific findings 
about climate change into a language and format that is 
suitable for making decisions about adaptation. These tools 

can also be useful for integrating local and traditional 
knowledge into the planning process.53 Appendix B lists 
additional resources on decision-support tools.

Recommended criteria for decision making (for example, 
no-regrets, win-win, the precautionary principle, 
reversible strategies)54 and techniques for appraising 
adaptation options (for example, cost-benefit analysis, cost 
effectiveness, multicriteria analysis),55 although important in 
the adaptation process, are not discussed in this document.
