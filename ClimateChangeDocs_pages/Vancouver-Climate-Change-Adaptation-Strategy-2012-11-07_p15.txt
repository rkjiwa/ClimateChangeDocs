25th return period for 3 hourly precipitation (highlighted) indicates that an 
event that occurred every 25 years during the past (4% chance of occurring 
each year) is expected to occur almost six times more frequently by 2050.
in Metro Vancouver, 5-, 10-, and 25- year return period daytime high hot events  
are projected to occur 2.4, 2.8, and 3.2 times as often, respectively. return 
periods for wet events are projected to occur 1.6, 1.9, and 2.5 times as often, 
respectively.

Sea level rise is a direct impact of climate change that is caused when warmer  
temperatures trigger both melting of continental glaciers and ice caps and 
the thermal expansion of oceans. At the regional and local scale, sea level  
will also be affected by local ocean and weather characteristics such as  
salinity, wind and currents, and by the vertical movement of the land due  
to geological processes (subsidence and uplift).

during the last century sea level rose by almost 8” (20 cm). What is most 
notable is that the rate of rise is increasing rapidly, almost doubling in the 
last three decades.16 Based on present and expected increases in emissions 
in the near future, sea levels are expected to rise at accelerating rates into 
the next century. Close monitoring and measurement over the last fifteen 
years has shown that the present trend is close to, or above, the upper  
envelope of global scenarios. 
projections for sea level cover a range, with greater weighting in the middle, 
as in most probability curves. Moderate projections for global average sea 
level rise this century are approximately 3 feet (1 m), but a few recent papers 
have raised the upper limit to 6 feet (2 m). Such forecasts are regularly 
revised and have generally moved upward over the last decade as the extent 
of melting in greenland and Antarctica increased.17 Jurisdictions around the  
world are using various sea level rise figures in planning to the end of the 
21st century. the new Zealand Ministry of environment is suggesting a 0.8m  
increase in areas where impacts will have high consequences. the U.S Army 
Corps uses 1m and 1.5m for low and high scenarios respectively; the delta 
Committee of the netherlands uses a range from 0.55m to 1.2m and the Lowe  
Study for the U.K released 2.5m as the upper limit of scenarios by 2100. 
in May, 2011 the BC Ministry of environment released draft guidelines providing  
sea level rise figures for use in evaluation of existing dikes, flood-proofing 
requirements and long term land use and planning issues. in formulating the 
guidelines, the province created a sea level change envelope reflecting the 
ranges of the most recent peer reviewed scientific projections. they chose 
a median curve as the basis for defining policy in BC that translates to the 
figures in table 5 below.
