STEP 1 
› Build a team
› Beging a dicussionon the issues or 
activity sector to prioritize

STEP 6 
› Identifiy actions to undertake in order to 
adopt adaptation measures
› Follow-up on impact of adaptation 
measures
› Adjust the plan as need be

STEP 5 
› Identify potential adaptation measures
› Prioritize adaptation measures

STEP 2 
› Describe the current system conditions
› Describe the current stresses (climatic and 
others)
› Describe the adaptation capacity of the 
system

STEP 3 
› Understand the observations 
› Understand climate simulations and 
future projections 
› Understand the uncertainties

STEP 4 
› Identify the impacts and opportunities 
linked to climate change
› Identify the importance of non-climatic 
factors 
› Evaluate the vulnerability of the system

Note that these steps are iterative. Users may find that they will need to go through some of the steps a number of times

The information presented in the guidebook are particularly useful to the completion of the third step, an 
important stepping-stone to the identification of impacts and opportunities under a changing climate.

This guide will highlight the fact that climate information can be tailored to suit the needs of a variety of 
users. With increased interactions between scientists and decision-makers, the gap between these two 
groups is decreasing and ultimately, users should increase their understanding of the different types of 
climate information and their usefulness while climate service providers should increase their understanding 
of the diversity of climate information users. In other words, users must be aware that they may not always 
need specific ‘decision-driven’ information, while climate service providers must be willing to better format 
‘science-driven’ information into something that the users can more readily incorporate into their studies. 
More specifically, the guide will help identify what are the right tools for the right job.
