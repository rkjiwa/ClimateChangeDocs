      "\n",
      "•\t limiting development in hazard-prone areas\n",
      "\n",
      "•\t ensuring that the built environment can \n",

      "\n",
      "•\t helping to preserve natural environments \n",
      "that protect communities against hazards \n",
      "(for example, dunes that absorb coastal \n",
      "storm effects) \n",
      "\n",
      "•\t educating stakeholders and decision makers \n",
      "about risks and opportunities and fostering \n",
      "dialogue about adaptation\n",
      "\n",
      "This document describes tools in the land use planning \n",
      "sector that communities can use in preparing to adapt to \n",
      "climate change. In addition, it provides information on \n",
      "decision-support tools, tools that provide information and \n",
      "resources to help planners and local decision makers take \n",
      "effective adaptation action. \n",
      "\n",
      "A brief example of each tool and its use by a Canadian \n",
      "community is given. Not every case discussed here was \n",
      "explicitly motivated by a desire to adapt to climate change. \n",
      "However, the significance of the tool to adaptation \n",
      "planning is clear in each case. An effort was made to select \n",
      "examples from communities of varying sizes and from all \n",
      "regions of Canada.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Although the examples are of broad utility, the design and \n",
      "application of a particular planning tool can vary greatly \n",
      "from one jurisdiction to another, depending on provincial \n",
      "or territorial laws and other factors. We describe the \n",
      "provincial and territorial roles in local adaptation planning \n",
      "in Appendix A. Readers interested in knowing how a \n",
      "particular tool is applied in a specific community should \n",
      "consult provincial, territorial and local laws.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is important to keep in mind that land use planning is \n",
      "used to pursue many local policy objectives, including \n",
      "providing affordable housing, stimulating job growth, \n",
      "preserving the character and heritage of a community, \n",
      "reducing greenhouse gas emissions, protecting biodiversity \n",
      "and enabling efficient transportation. A key challenge for \n",
      "planners and local decision makers is how to incorporate \n",
      "and balance the need to prepare for climate change \n",
      "through adaptation with other local development \n",
      "objectives. Another consideration is how to integrate \n",
      "(mainstream) consideration of changing climate into \n",
      "the wide array of decisions made by local governments, \n",
      "from operating municipal services to capital spending, \n",

      "\n",
      "•\t enabling legislation – Provinces enact and revise \n",
      "laws that guide planning by local and regional \n",
      "authorities. Those laws establish the regulatory and \n",
      "policy tools that control land use at the local level \n",
      "and define how and when they may be used. For \n",
      "example, provincial planning acts prescribe the kinds \n",

      "regulations and policies, to which local and regional \n",
      "plans generally must conform, on planning issues \n",
      "of concern across the province. Those policies may \n",
      "address topics relevant to local adaptation efforts. For \n",

      "food security and the design of more resilient urban \n",
      "communities.\n",
      "\n",
      "•\t provincial adaptation plans and programs – \n",
      "Many provinces have their own formal plans for \n",
      "adapting to climate change. Typically, such plans \n",
      "specify provincial goals and objectives; identify the \n",
      "impacts of climate change on government programs, \n",

      "actions. For example, a plan may call for more high-\n",

      "and conveners to assist local governments, the private \n",
      "sector and civic organizations in adapting to climate \n",

      "\n",
      "•\t direct involvement in development decisions – \n",

      "instance, as appellate bodies on a zoning dispute \n",
      "or as the final approving authority on local official \n",
      "plans). In some circumstances, provincial officials \n",
      "are directly involved in local development decisions. \n",
      "This may be the case for sites and issues that fall \n",

      "construction, unincorporated communities, local \n",

      "design and implementation of local adaptation \n",
      "measures.\n",
      "\n",
      "•\t intergovernmental relations – Provinces negotiate \n",
      "agreements, collaborate on programs and projects, \n",
      "and manage their relations with other provinces \n",
      "and the federal government. In that capacity, a \n",
      "province can help set the conditions for participation \n",
      "by local governments in programs that support or \n",
      "complement adaptation. An example is the set of \n",
      "agreements between the Government of Canada and \n",
      "various provinces governing the allocation of federal \n",
      "gas-tax funds. \n",
      "\n",

      "territories of Nunavut, the Northwest Territories and \n",
      "Yukon have jurisdiction over land use planning and many \n",
      "other local matters. However, these legislative powers do \n",
      "not spring directly from the Constitution but instead are \n",
      "delegated to the territories by the Government of Canada \n",
      "under various laws.89,90,91 Territorial governments in turn \n",
