                                            CLIMATE CHANGE AND HEALTH Climate change is likely to impact  most areas of our lives, including  our health. In British Columbia,  the principal hazards include  rising temperatures, sea level  rise, and increased frequency  and intensity of extreme weather  events. These hazards bring new  and complex challenges, but by  working together, we can increase  our collective knowledge base and  begin to think more strategically  about how best to prepare to  protect health.   Population and community  health are influenced by wider  social, cultural, economic and  environmental factors. These  factors are commonly known as  health determinants, and they are  closely linked to a range of health  outcomes. Increasingly, climate  change hazards are impacting  health determinants. As illustrated  in the figure, these impacts in turn  influence and affect physical and  mental health outcomes.   ADDRESSING CLIMATE AND HEALTH RISKS IN BC  Figure: Climate change hazards and their impacts on health determinants and health outcomes  CLIMATE CHANGE   HEALTH RISKS The World Health Organization has identified climate change as the biggest global health threat of the 21st century.  Here in British Columbia, climate change is clearly observable and many people are already feeling its effects. With  some degree of climate change now locked-in regardless of mitigation efforts, climate change adaptation is necessary  to ensure British Columbia will fare well in the future.   The challenge is significant, but British Columbia is well positioned to respond given strong capacity across different  sectors. There are many specific actions that the larger health community can take to respond and prepare for climate  change.  These actions often fall within the day-to-day responsibilities of the health care community and align with the  sector’s overarching goal: improving health and well-being outcomes for all British Columbians.

Vulnerable groups such as young children, the elderly, people with existing cardiopulmonary and respiratory  illnesses, low-income families and people with mental wellness challenges are at greater risk.
