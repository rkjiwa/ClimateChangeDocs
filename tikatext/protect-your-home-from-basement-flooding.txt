ICLR-SL BaseFlood-D10 Jun18-12 E-FINAL_x  12-06-18  12:40 PM  Page A    The Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction (ICLR), established in 1997, is a world-class centre for multidisciplinary disaster prevention research and communication. ICLR is an independent, not-for-pro!t research institute founded by the insurance industry and af!liated with the University of Western Ontario.  The Institute’s mission is to reduce the loss of life and property caused by severe weather and earthquakes through the identi!cation and support of sustained actions that improve society’s capacity to adapt to, anticipate, mitigate, withstand and recover from natural disasters.  ICLR’s mandate is to confront the alarming increase in disaster losses caused by natural disasters and to work to reduce disaster deaths, injuries and property damage. Disaster damage has been doubling every !ve to seven years since the 1960s, an alarming trend.   The greatest tragedy is that many disaster losses are preventable.  ICLR is committed to the development and communication of disaster prevention knowledge. For the individual homeowner, this translates into the identi!cation of natural hazards that you and your home  are vulnerable to. The Institute further informs individual homeowners what steps may be followed to better protect your family and  your home.  The purpose of this booklet is to outline steps that you can take to protect your home from basement "ooding. Some of these measures are simple and free; others cost money. All contribute to reducing the risk of basement "ooding.

Never pour fats, oils and grease down your drains!  Reduce home water use during heavy rains.   Keep the storm sewer grates on your street clear  of yard waste, leaves, garbage, ice and snow.   Clean and maintain your eavestroughs  and downspouts at least once a year.  Store anything expensive, valuable or irreplaceable upstairs   These are some initial steps to prevent basement !ooding. However,  if you have had water in your basement in the past then you need take more signi"cant steps to protect your home.  1  2  3  4  5  1  Start reducing your risk of basement !ooding  Six reasons you should invest in ways  to protect your home 1 If water got into your home before, it could get in again unless  you take action.  2 Finished basements used as living space may have more furniture and expensive electronics, making it more important to protect your home.  3 Overland "ood damage is not covered by your home insurance policy. A small cost now can save you a lot of money after the "ood.  4 Floods may have long-term health impacts on your family if they cause moulds to grow.   5 Homes in older neighborhoods are usually more vulnerable than homes in newer neighborhoods.  6 Climate change scientists report that severe rain storms are occurring more often in many parts of Canada, and they are expected to continue to increase in frequency and severity.

How do you report basement !ooding to them?  ! What does your local government suggest you do?  ! Do they offer any "nancial assistance programs for plumbing installations?  ! Do they recommend contractors or plumbers?  ! What permits do you need in order to begin?  First steps 1. Talk to your local government. The !rst step is to visit your municipal government’s website or contact the public works, utilities or building department to !nd out about their programs on reducing basement "ooding.   2. Talk to your insurance agent or broker. Talk to your insurance agent or broker to !nd out about what types of water damages are covered under your policy. Trying to make a claim after you have suffered water damage is not a good way to !nd out that you don’t have the proper coverage, or that overland "ooding  is uninsurable.  3. Get a plumber to conduct a plumbing investigation of your home  Each home is unique. A plumber or contractor who is fully versed in home and municipal drainage systems can best help you protect your home. Understanding the risks of basement "ooding and the nature of your plumbing and sewer connections will help to ensure that the best course of action is taken to reduce future water damage in your home. Your municipality may help you !nd a plumber.   ICLR-SL BaseFlood-D10 Jun18-12 E-FINAL_x  12-06-18  12:40 PM  Page 2    1. Taking action on your own Seal cracks in foundation walls and basement !oors Sealing cracks is a simple way to help reduce basement "ooding in your home. In many cases, cracks can be effectively sealed from inside. Most of the time, you should not have to dig anywhere beside the foundation to repair them.   Disconnect your downspouts, add extensions and splash pads Downspouts are designed to convey water from eavestroughs and down the side of the house. Downspouts often direct water to the surface of the lot, but in many cases they may be connected to the weeping tile or the sanitary sewer lateral.   •  Downspout extensions should be directed at least 1.8 metres (6 ft) away from the home, and the "ows should be directed over permeable surfaces, such as lawns or gardens, and not paved surfaces including driveways or walkways.  •  Talk to your municipal government before you do this.  When connected to the municipal sanitary sewer system, eavestrough downspouts can contribute a substantial amount of water to these systems. Because of the environmental impacts resulting from combined sewer over!ows and the increase in basement "ooding risk that connected eavestroughs cause, it is illegal to connect downspouts to municipal sewer systems in many Canadian communities.  3  If your downspout looks similar to these, chances are it is connected to your weeping tile or the municipal sanitary sewer system and should be changed.

Questions for a plumber In many cases, it is the more substantive measures that are the most effective way to reduce basement "ooding. Many of these require the assistance of a licensed plumber. Municipal governments often require permits for the plumbing and drainage improvements described in this document. Talk to your municipal government to make sure you or the person you have hired have the proper permits.  Is poor grading causing my !ooding?  The slope of your yard is very important to keep water away from your home and foundation. This helps keep the basement dry. You should:  • Check your lot to see if your yard slopes away from your home. Look everywhere, including under stairs and decks. The soil directly beside your foundation wall should be approximately 10 cm to 15 cm higher than the soil 1.5 metres away from the foundation.  • If you notice that the ground close to the foundation of your house has settled beside your foundation wall, !ll it in with a solid, compactable soil – like clay – so that there is  a constant slope away from the foundation.  • Talk to the department in your municipal government that is responsible for building inspections and stormwater drainage about swales (the grassy depressions that help direct water away from homes) and lot grading. Ask them where swales should be on your property, and where water from your lot should be directed.  Do I have a weeping tile? A weeping tile or foundation drain is an underground perforated pipe that runs along the bottom of a home’s foundation. Older Canadian homes, for example those built before the 1940s or 1950s, may not have foundation drains. If you !nd that your home does not have a foundation drain and you experience serious in!ltration "ooding, you should consider having a foundation drain installed.  Typical backyard swale with a drain.  ICLR-SL BaseFlood-D10 Jun18-12 E-FINAL_x  12-06-18  12:40 PM  Page 4    5  If you do have a foundation drain, it can become clogged with debris or collapse in some sections. A plumber will need to decide if it can be !xed or it needs to be replaced. If a plumber does !x or replace the weeping tile, ICLR recommends including a clean- out port with access from the surface to allow easier maintenance in the future.  What is my weeping tile connected to? A weeping tile that is directly connected to your home’s sanitary sewer lateral increases the amount of water that enters the municipal sewer system during a heavy rainfall. Disconnecting your weeping tile from the sanitary or storm sewer can help reduce the chances that you and your neighbours will experience basement "ooding. It can also reduce the risk of structural damage to your home.  Do I have a sump-pump? When weeping tiles are disconnected from sewer laterals, a sump-pit and sump-pump must be installed. The sump-pump is used to pump water from the weeping tiles to the lot’s surface. In some unique cases, municipalities may recommend a sump-pump to pump weeping tile water to the storm sewer system.  Is my sump-pump working correctly? Sump-pumps get blocked and can fail if they are not routinely inspected and maintained. On-going maintenance helps to ensure the sump-pump keeps working long term. You can inspect the sump-pump by pouring water into the sump pit, and seeing whether or not the pump starts automatically.   Sump-pumps need electricity. They stop working during a power failure. You should use a back-up system to make sure the pump works when you need it. Talk to your plumber or electrician about options.

A mainline backwater valve is placed directly into the sewer lateral at the foot of your basement wall. The device allows sewage to "ow in only one direction – out of your house. When sewage begins to move toward your basement, the valve closes. Some municipalities offer subsidies to offset the cost of installing a backwater valve. Make sure you install the type of valve recommended by your municipality. Installation of the backwater valve may reduce the cost of insurance  or be required as a condition of insurability.

In most cases they require the normally open (or open-port) mainline backwater valve. This valve is installed directly into the sanitary sewer lateral, and serves to protect all home plumbing !xtures from sewer backup.  When installing backwater valves:  The valve should be installed based on the manufacturer’s installation instructions, which have speci!cations for placement and grading.

ICLR-SL BaseFlood-D10 Jun18-12 E-FINAL_x  12-06-18  12:40 PM  Page 7    8  Proper placement and installation of the backwater valve is extremely important. If placed in the wrong location relative to other plumbing !xtures on the sanitary lateral, the valve could be bypassed and provide no protection.  If the valve is placed in the wrong location, sewer backup pressure can build up and crack the basement "oor and lead to "ooding.   If the weeping tiles are still connected to the sanitary sewer lateral downstream of the valve, sewage could be forced back into the weeping tiles and lead to structural damage to the foundation, this can also lead to in!ltration "ooding.  Like other parts of your home, backwater valves require periodic maintenance to ensure proper performance. An improperly maintained valve may fail during a "ood. Most mainline backwater valves come with a see-through top so you can check to see if it is clogged with debris. The valve should be checked regularly to ensure that it will function properly when it is needed. You will likely need the help of a quali!ed plumber to carry out maintenance of the valve.   After a backwater valve has been installed do not use plumbing, for example, "ushing toilets, running dishwashers, washing machines, or running taps, etc. during intense rainfall events. If the home plumbing is used when the backwater valve is closed, water will have no way  to exit your home until the valve has reopened. If you’re not sure if the valve is closed, check it – you should be able to see it through the clear, plastic top.

Sewer laterals, the pipes that connect a home’s plumbing system to the municipal underground sewer system, should be regularly maintained. Over time, the sanitary sewer lateral can get clogged with fats, oils and grease (FOGS) or other debris, which can restrict "ows and cause sewer backup. This may especially be a problem in older homes when the lateral has not been routinely maintained. Sewer laterals are accessed through the cleanout port, which may be located either inside of the basement or outside of the home, close to where the lateral enters the home.   To !nd out how well your sanitary sewer lateral has been maintained, you should talk to a licensed plumber who can carry out a camera inspection of your lateral. A plumbing inspection will identify if it is contributing to your "ood risk. Some communities recommend that homeowners replace their sewer lateral every 30 years or so.  Basement windows If your basement windows are close to the surface of the ground, window wells and window well covers can reduce the crevasses that allow water to enter. The outer edges of the window well should !t snugly against the wall. The bottom of the well should be 15 cm below the underside  of the window with a mixture  of gravel and sand to allow drainage.
