continue to change - in some cases dramatically.  How global warming will affect the climate and weather  patterns across Canada is complicated by the vast landscapes that comprise our nation, and the complex array of  direct and indirect effects that are already anticipated.  Our uncertain future should compel professionals and  decision-makers to be better informed and more capable of making effective and insightful decisions.    Our hope for a stable and sustainable future requires that action be taken today. Whether the goal is to reduce  the emissions that are warming the planet, or to prepare society for anticipated changes, efforts towards  mitigation and adaptation must begin now.  Everyone is responsible, everyone needs to act.     The PRIMERs are provided in a four-volume set.  PRIMER ONE summarizes the science on climate weather and  change.  PRIMER TWO provides information on how individuals, communities and organizations can begin now to  prepare for anticipated changes.  PRIMER THREE presents planning and design tools, existing and emerging, that  can help in the creation of resilient and prosperous communities and sustainable ecosystems.  PRIMER FOUR  summarizes approaches and tools focused on one of the fastest emerging challenges – rising water levels.     The Primers are intended to augment your basic understanding of the science on global warming and climate  change, to provide improved access to information on anticipated impacts to Canadian landscapes, and to promote  improved understanding of the options available to society through adaptive planning for change.  Should you wish  to expand your understanding on the topics discussed, access the materials referenced in the Additional Readings  and Resources on the Web, and reach out to do your own search for newer information.  Climate adaptation is a  rapidly evolving knowledge area.    The Primers rely on two categories of information: reports and papers that have been freely distributed on the  internet; and a selection of books and peer-reviewed papers.  Many of the reports and books referenced are  available from public or university libraries.  Should the URLs provided for material available on the internet  become inactive, it could mean only that the material has been moved, not that it is outdated or no longer relevant.   We encourage you to search by author and/or title to find the document.     Peer reviewed papers are included here because they are an important source of information on climate change  science, mitigation and adaptation, and the first access point for new knowledge.  Some journal papers are  provided freely on the Internet.  Unfortunately, digital access to other journals requires paid subscriptions, or  individual papers can be purchased on-line.  Most university libraries in Canada provide memberships to the public  for a nominal annual fee, but not all may include access to online journals.  However, in addition to borrowing  texts, hard and/or electronic copies of many journals can be viewed at the library.  Readers can also become  members of local, regional, or national communities of practice, where enrollment and access to many valuable  sources of information are freely provided.         PRIMER ONE:    CLIMATE, WEATHER AND CHANGE   Chapters One and Two provide users with a summary   of the current science on global warming, and the   current and projected future changes in weather and   climate throughout Canada.  Chapter Three   summarizes current thinking on the effects   anticipated environmental change will have on   ecosystems, on society and on local as well as   regional economics.     PRIMER TWO:    PREPARING FOR CHANGE   Chapter Four focusses on managing risk and   understanding the role played in decision-making by   uncertainty.  Chapter Five outlines the need to   change what we do, to mitigate and to adapt.    Chapter Six provides direction for those seeking a   better future, incorporating existing instruments and   tools with emerging principles and processes for   guiding change.   PRIMER THREE:   CREATING RESILIENT COMMUNITIES   Chapter Seven summarizes opportunities to create   resilient communities that integrate with their natural   environment and promote well being and   sustainability for humans and ecosystems.    PRIMER FOUR:   FACING RISING WATERS   Chapter Eight examines preventative and protective   measures to rising water, whether it is fresh water   (overland flooding) or the result of rising sea levels   and/or storm surges.       2 | P a g e    8 PREPARING FOR FLOOD  8.1 A CHANGING PROBLEM   It is understandable why the threat of high water can be the primary issue in  climate change adaptation initiatives.  For inland communities, this threat will  primarily derive from heavy downfalls or extended periods of precipitation.  For  communities at or near fresh or marine water bodies, flooding can also be the  result of spring melts and ice jams, and higher than normal storm surges/seiches  driven by extreme weather.  Along marine coasts, flooding can result from all of  the above, as well as from higher than normal tides, and as the result of increases  in mean sea level (Figure 8-1).  As the climate continues to warm, communities at  risk, and other residents of flood-prone areas, will face a double challenge: more  water coming down stream and overland and higher water levels at the shore.     As water levels rise, and precipitation and other conditions change, we must get  better at KNOWING THE PROBLEM.  We must improve our knowledge of current  conditions, develop a comprehensive understanding of changing conditions, and  anticipate the growing potential for dramatic impacts to local environments during  extreme weather events.  We need to inventory and map the physical, ecological,  economic and cultural parameters of our local area, to model and map the changes  to come, and to ensure that the linkages across environment, economy, society  and culture are well documented.  We need to increasingly rely on emerging  science to continually update our understanding of when changes will pose  unacceptable risks to the safety, health and well-being of humans.  We need to  employ digital tools to visualize changing conditions and new norms, so that  causes, and effects of flooding events are fully understood, our ability to anticipate  extreme events is improved, and proposed adaptive and response actions are well  supported by the community.         FIGURE 8-1:  Causes of flooding in Nova Scotia –1759-1986 (Image Credit; Environment and   Climate Change Canada:  Accessed at: https://www.ec.gc.ca/eau-  water/default.asp?lang=En&n=4FCB81DD-1 ).   https://www.ec.gc.ca/eau-water/default.asp?lang=En&n=4FCB81DD-1 https://www.ec.gc.ca/eau-water/default.asp?lang=En&n=4FCB81DD-1   3 | P a g e    We must also improve our capacity for CONFRONTING THE PROBLEM, by acting to reduce vulnerabilities  of assets and populations, to conserve and sustain natural features, and to shelter assets by building  protective walls and structures, with the full realization that much of what we will do may only be a  temporary solution to an increasing threat.  In the present, we need to confront changing conditions, by  employing low-regret and no-regret options to accommodate change and to protect properties,  populations and environments.  Investing in infrastructure that is designed and built to perform well in a  changing environment will enhance resilience over a longer term and increase the options available to  future generations.  HOLDING THE LINE commits us to preventing further flooding through deployment of  protection measures intended to hold water back, and/or to manage anticipated changes to our shorelines  resulting from more intense storms and changes in water levels, while recognizing that many of these  mechanisms may not be effective in the long term.    In facing rising waters, we may not necessarily be prepared to plan today for future conditions that are  anticipated but not yet experienced.  AVOIDING THE PROBLEM may be the best long-term solution for  sustaining assets and activities.  Avoiding existing and emerging hazards will require difficult social decisions  on how, when and what we migrate to less vulnerable locations.     To move these plans forward in a timely manner, we also need to accept, like King Canute, that we cannot  stop the steady onset of change, and that in the coming future, migration of assets and activities to safer  more sustainable locations may become necessary to ensure communities remain livable, and people are  safe (Figure 8-2)  Though it will be complicated and, in some cases, difficult, accepting the inevitability of  the increased hazards posed to our towns, villages and environments, will protect society in the short term,  and open minds towards the opportunities for a more sustainable future.     Overall, adaptation options to slow, reduce or to prepare for rising waters should include all the following:   • ensure decision-making (including planning for future opportunities) focused on the ways and  means to reduce GHGs and sequester carbon, to slow the rate of sea-level rise and to reduce the  intensity and frequency of severe weather;   • promote stormwater management measures such as low impact development and increased  infiltration to ground water;   • waterproof buildings and homes, moving essential and/or expensive systems and assets to less  vulnerable elevations;   • protect and conserve natural features (e.g., beaches, dunes, wetlands, stream banks) to ensure  their sustainability and to capitalize on their potential to dampen storm effects and reduce impacts  from rising water levels;    • create public understanding of the time-limited capacity for seawalls and other protective  measures to reduce risks, and the costs associated with what will in some areas be a temporary  solution;   • restrict human use of areas designated as occasionally or permanently hazardous;   • prevent new development in hazardous areas, and    • plan for future relocation of valued assets and activities on sites that are free of hazard.    FIGURE 8-2:  Practical understanding of planning and design for life-  cycle expectancies for structures at threat from sea-level rise (Simpson   et al. 2012).   Whereas flooding from unanticipated and  unusual storm systems can be a fact of life  in some areas of Canada, flooding that is  the result of a steadily increasing rise in  mean sea level, storm surges and higher  waves is an ever-present danger, that will  only intensify over time.     4 | P a g e    8.2 KNOWING THE PROBLEM   Mean water levels in lakes, rivers, marshes and oceans change over time -  sometimes daily, sometimes monthly,  sometimes seasonally, sometimes because of weather.  Water levels change because of daily tides, snow melt,  storms and as the result of precipitation events, or droughts.     When dealing with severe weather, some Canadians may still rely primarily on their individual or collective memory  to assess their vulnerabilities and/or to prepare themselves for future storms (e.g., “the water has NEVER risen  above this level, my home doesn’t flood”).  In parts of Canada, flooding is already occurring in areas that were not  considered vulnerable, either the result of deluges of rainfall, or the combined actions of high tides, storm surges,  higher waves, and downstream flooding resulting from high precipitation.  When all these contributing factors  occur at once, flood levels can reach previously unknown levels.     Improving our knowledge of existing and anticipated conditions and the associated changes in vulnerabilities and  risk of flooding: requires (El-Jabi et al. 2015; Faulkner et al. 2016):   • a clear understanding of the terms used to describe both freshwater and marine water levels;    • monitoring of trends in low, mean and high-water levels and changes in mean sea level and  extreme tides; and   • improved understanding of current flooding vulnerabilities coupled with ongoing modelling of  anticipated changes to flood conditions.    On tidal waters in Canada, water levels change twice a day, resulting in two periods of high water and two periods  of low water each day.  Water levels change in the following steps (Figure 8-3):   • Sea level rises over several hours, creating the flood tide, which gradually covers the intertidal area of   shorelines;   • When the water reaches its highest level, high tide has been achieved;   • Sea level then falls over several hours, creating the ebb tide;   • When the water level stops falling, low tide has been achieved.     Changes in mean water levels are associated with the position of the moon and the sun and are referred to as   spring or neap tides, periods when mean high and mean low water levels will be higher or lower than usual.    On non-tidal waters in Canada, bathymetric charts measure water depth against an established point or chart  datum, established so that the water level will be above the datum 95% of the time.  This insures that water craft  can be assured of minimum water depths suitable for navigation.  In some water basins such as the Great Lakes,  precipitation changes can result in periods of higher or lower water.  Chart datum is set with lower water periods  in mind.  On rivers, chart datum is a sloping surface that approximates the slope of the river surface during low  water periods, over the length of the river.         CHART DATUM CANADA   For navigational safety, depths on a bathymetric   chart are shown from a low-water surface or a low-  water datum called chart datum. Chart datum is   selected so that the water level will seldom fall   below it, and only rarely will there be less depth   available than what is portrayed on the chart.    Criteria used to refine the choice of a chart datum   include: 1) the datum is so low that the water level   will but seldom fall below it, 2) it is not so low as to   cause the charted depths to be unrealistically   shallow, and 3) it should vary only gradually from   area to area and from chart to adjoining chart, to   avoid significant discontinuities.    On most Canadian coastal marine charts, the   surface of lower low water, large tide (LLWLT), has   been adopted as chart datum, but the term " lowest   normal tide, " or " LNT, " has been retained on the   charts since it encompasses a variety of other   choices for chart datum on some older charts.   (Fisheries and Oceans Canada: Accessible at   http://www.tides.gc.ca/eng/info/verticaldatums ).   VERTICAL DATUMS   A vertical datum is a surface of zero elevation to   which heights of various points are referred in   order that those heights be in a consistent system.   More broadly, a vertical datum is the entire system   of the zero-elevation surface and methods of   determining heights relative to that surface. Over   the years, many different types of vertical datums   have been used. The most predominant types   today are tidal datums and geodetic datums.   (NOAA: Accessible at   http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/datums/vertical/ ).   http://www.tides.gc.ca/eng/info/verticaldatums http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/datums/vertical/   5 | P a g e    Established datums are a consistent system for determining the elevation of marine  and fresh waters in Canada (Figure 8-3), or for elevation of land.  Until relatively  recently, the charting of water depths in navigable areas was separate from the  mapping of land topography.  In some situations, this meant that the place where  mean water levels met the land were not necessarily congruent.  Historical  differences between the standards by which land was mapped (i.e., topography) and  the standards by which sea levels were mapped (e.g., bathymetry) have in the past  resulted in discontinuities in the location of the mean sea level.  By example, 0.0  metres (where the land meets the water) elevation on a topographic map may not  occur at exactly the same place as 0.0 metres (where the sea meets the land)  indicates on a bathymetric map.  This situation can result in quite different  configurations of the shoreline and could significantly complicate efforts to  determine the effects of changing water levels on local areas.   Establishing a common vertical datum is critical to all discussions of flood conditions.   Care must be taken that the Chart Datum established for any locale is in accordance  with current data on mean sea level and has been adjusted to reflect departures  from the established Geodetic Datum.  As sea and water levels change, and land  sinks or rises across the country, adjustments are being made to established and  historic mean water levels.   Before proceeding with mapping of sea-level changes, and/or trends in overland  flooding, expert advice should be sought to ensure that all mapping systems used,  whether national, provincial/territorial, or municipal have been ratified to a  commonly understood benchmark that defines mean water level, and that all new  data intended for use in GIS models has been appropriately geo-referenced to the  accepted standards.                                                                  FIGURE 8-3:  Terms used to describe yearly changes in tidal conditions in Canada, including spring tides and neap tides    (IMAGE CREDIT; Ulamm, Wikipedia CC BY-SA 3.0)).     6 | P a g e    8.2.1 STORM SURGES AND SEICHES   Water levels can also change as a result of strong and persistent winds blowing across long stretches of open water  that cause water to ‘pile up’ along the shoreline.  Along marine shores, this phenomenon is referred to as a storm  surge (Figure 8-4).  In enclosed harbours, or along lake shorelines, the changes in water level caused by wind  conditions is termed a seiche (Figure 8-5).  When storm surges and seiches occur during periods of unusually high- water levels (high tides, spring or neap tides, seasonal melts), significant flooding can occur.     Today, the main changes to mean water levels that depart from that which we have come to understand as normal  and exceed conditions for which we have prepared, are most often the result of severe weather conditions.  It can  be difficult to scientifically conclude that increasingly frequent or more severe storms is directly attributable to  global warming, because we do not as yet have a statistically valid record for these extremes in severe weather.   However, evidence is growing, sufficient for prudent decision-makers to alter established best practices in planning  and design, and to have more trust in the scientific models that predict that even worse conditions are to come.              STORM SURGE: a wind and atmospheric   pressure-driven increase in water level that   combines with tide conditions to form the total   water elevation during a storm.   And abnormal rise of water generated by a storm,   over and above the predicted tide level.  Water is   pushed towards the shore by the force of the   storm winds. The rise in water level can result in   extreme flooding in low lying areas, especially   when storm surge is combined with high tides.    The storm surge created during Hurricane Katrina   (2005) created water levels 6 to 7 metres above   normal tide, resulting in damages in excess of $75   Billion USD.     STORM TIDE the water level rises due to a   combination of storm surge and the astronomical   tide.     FIGURE 8-4:  Storm tides and water levels (Image Credit: NOS/NWS/NOAA, used with   permission. Available at https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/stormsurge-stormtide.html   ).   HURRICANE SANDY STORM SURGE    Hurricane Sandy was directly responsible for   approximately 150 deaths and $70 Billion in losses.    About half of the deaths occurred in the Caribbean   and half in the United States, including 44 in New   York City.  Sandy’s 14.1-foot elevation (above mean   low low water; MLLW) set the record at the Battery   tide gauge.  Several factors caused the extreme   surge.     Sandy’s minimum pressure was the lowest ever   recorded at landfall north of Cape Hatteras, NC.    With a tropical storm-force wind field of close to   1000 miles in diameter, Sandy was among the   largest storms as well.  Hurricane Sandy’s unusual   westward-turning track also concentrated storm   surge, wind, and waves in the New York   metropolitan region.  Part of the extensive coastal   flooding was because Sandy’s peak surge   coincided with high tide (Horton et al. 2015.)   https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/stormsurge-stormtide.html   7 | P a g e           SEICHE    Periodic oscillations of water level set in motion by some atmospheric disturbance   passing over an enclosed, or partially enclosed, body of water. The disturbances that   cause seiches include the rapid changes in atmospheric pressure with the passage   of low or high-pressure weather systems, rapidly-moving weather fronts, and major   shifts in the directions of strong winds. Seiches exist on the Great Lakes, other large,   confined water bodies, and on partially-enclosed arms of the sea (University of   Wisconsin Sea Grant Institute. Available at:    http://seagrant.wisc.edu/Home/Topics/CoastalEngineering/Details.aspx?PostID=694 ).   Seiches are typically caused when strong winds and rapid changes in atmospheric   pressure push water from one end of a body of water to the other. When the wind   stops, the water rebounds to the other side of the enclosed area. The water then   continues to oscillate back and forth for hours or even days. In a similar fashion,   earthquakes, tsunamis, or severe storm fronts may also cause seiches along ocean   shelves and ocean harbors.    In some of the Great Lakes and other large bodies of water, the time between the   "high" and "low" of a seiche can be as much as four to seven hours.  This is very   similar to the time period between a high and low tide in the oceans and is often   mistaken as a tide.     (USA/NOAA. Available at: https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/seiche.html ).

When the   perfect storm arrives, it generally arrives   with the perfect wind direction and fetch to   drive water even higher and to force   dangerous and damaging waves onto the   shore.   When this storm also drops high   levels of precipitation, and/or occurs during   high water periods (e.g., snow melt, high   precipitation periods, high tides), water   coming downstream, and overland meets   water being pushed higher and further   ashore.  Flooding conditions can reach new   heights, wave action can damage shoreline   protection measures, and in some areas, ice   floes can be driven dangerously ashore.   http://seagrant.wisc.edu/Home/Topics/CoastalEngineering/Details.aspx?PostID=694 https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/seiche.html http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Seiche   8 | P a g e    8.2.2 ANTICIPATING STORMS   Storms bring with them intensified precipitation, winds, storm surges along coasts (i.e.,  elevated mean sea or large lake water levels caused by wind), and more active nearshore  waves.  Coastal areas in Canada are experiencing more frequent and more intense storms  during all seasons, storms that do not fit expectations of ‘typical weather patterns’.    By example, in the Toronto area in the past 25 years, rainfall events have included three 100- year storms, and six 50-year storms (David Phillips, Environment Canada).  In 2014, Burlington,  Ontario experienced flash flooding, the result of 190 mm of rainfall in less than two hours.  This  ‘1000-year storm’ was made even more remarkable because communities on either side of  Burlington received little to no rainfall from the same event.  Predicable storms of the past are  transforming into intensive cells that may only affect individual towns or even be confined to  specific neighbourhoods.     INTENSITY-DURATION-FREQUENCY CURVES   Stormwater infrastructure systems in Canada have not been designed or equipped to handle  precipitation events of the magnitude being experienced, with consequential increases in the  spatial extent of areas affected by local flooding.  Seawalls and breakwaters are proving  insufficient to withstand heavier wave action at the shore, and nearshore properties are  suffering previously unanticipated damage.  Future planning and design must strive not only to  reduce stormwater at source, but also to avoid development in areas now deemed to have an  increased potential for future flooding.    Key among the new tools being developed to assist in anticipating the impacts of more  intensive storm systems are new models for predicting changes in intensity, duration and  frequency (IDF) of precipitation.  IDF curves can provide planners, engineers and landscape  architects with an improved capacity to understand how precipitation in their area will alter  during peak storm events and will aid assessment of the capacity of existing stormwater  systems to carry the anticipated changes in water loads.     When IDF curves are combined with projected climate scenarios (e.g., weather patterns,  temperature and precipitation models); with updated hydrologic models (e.g., rainfall -runoff);  and with hydraulic models (e.g., mapping of existing and anticipated floodplain areas for  surface waters), decision-makers can develop a more realistic appreciation of the potential for  overland flooding.       STORM RETURN PERIODS   A 100-year storm event is a storm that has rainfall and winds at a level   that we can expect there to be a one in one hundred (1%) chance of such   a storm event occurring in any given year.  And unlikely that there will be   more than one of those storm events in a 100-year period.  A 500-year   storm would have a 0.2% chance of occurring in any given year    The IPCC has determined that throughout much of the world, climate   change will increase the frequency and severity of storms.  In Canada,   some areas have already experienced several 100-year storm events in   the past decade.     INTENSITY-DURATION-FREQUENCY (IDF) CURVE   An IDF curve is a graphical representation of the probability that   rainfall of a particular intensity will occur, within a predicted period of   time.  Rainfall intensity (mm/hour), rainfall duration (how many hours it   will rain at that intensity) and rainfall frequency (how often that sort of   event can be expected to repeat itself) are the parameters used to   calculate the IDF curve for a particular location.  As periods of intense   rainfall (e.g., cloudbursts) appear in some areas to be more frequent,   professionals are using newly collected data on intensity and duration   to recalculate the IDF curves used in local planning and design.   CLOUDBURST   A cloudburst is a colloquial term that has come to mean a sudden, very   heavy rainfall, usually local in nature, that can deposit an extreme   amount of precipitation in a short period of time.  Most cloudbursts are   associated with thunderstorms so can be accompanied by lightning and   hail.     While anticipated in mountainous areas, these types of intense rainfalls   are now being experienced in other geographic regions.      9 | P a g e    AN IDF CURVE LOOKUP TOOL FOR ONTARIO   The IDF Curve Lookup Tool is a high quality, precise interpolator of extreme   rainfall statistics that estimates future rainfall intensity, duration and frequency   (IDF). Good estimates of peak rainfall statistics are essential for infrastructure   design, hydraulic structure design, or flood plain mapping.     Designed by researchers at the University of Waterloo for the Ontario Ministry of   Transportation (MTO), this stormwater management tool extracts local statistics   with high spatial resolution and high temporal resolution (Soulis et al. 2015).  The   tool has a two per cent standard error in the results. The IDF Curve Look Up Tool   is free to use, and while currently limited to Ontario, it easily could be expanded   to other regions.   Environment Canada provides peak rainfall intensities at selected Meteorological   Services of Canada (MSC) stations across Canada.  Of these stations, 147 are in   Ontario.  Previously in Ontario, if a project did not have one of the MSC stations   nearby, manual interpolation was required to estimate design rainfalls for the   project location.  The IDF Tool automatically interpolates the MSC rainfall data,   saving planning and design professionals up to a day and a half per project.  The   consistency of the results—regardless of user—can greatly facilitate approval   processes.    Users can either enter coordinates for their project or use the Google maps   interface embedded on the IDF tool website.  Once the location is defined, or   multiple locations in the case of large projects, the tool produces IDF curves with   an error range.  The difference between the output IDF curves is different from   the original MSC station curves, but their overlap is generally within the 95 per   cent confidence intervals.    These new IDF curves ensure more reliable and precise representations of recent   weather patterns.  The curves can reflect changes in historic data and are   updatable as new rainfall data becomes available.  The tool is easily updated as   new MSC IDF curve parameters are published.     The interface tool is available through the MTO Website at:   http://www.mto.gov.on.ca/IDF_Curves/terms.shtml       The Ontario A values are used in the equation R = A•τ-B for the generation of IDF curves. The A   values are equivalent to the values for the 1-hour design storm.  The values shown are for the   100-year design storm, with time-trend adjustments to 2010.

Too often, too little  emphasis is placed on the cumulative effects on flooding caused by the combination of a range of factors (e.g.,  rising sea levels, higher tides, storm surge, intensive wave action, snow and ice melt, cloudburst precipitation,  dam or levee failures).  In coastal locations such as Greater Vancouver, higher tides, rising seas, and storm surge  can combine with precipitation events to exacerbate anticipated overland flooding estimates, and waters  rushing downstream in rivers are blocked by higher sea levels and spill onto adjacent lands.  More intensive  storms can drive higher water levels and taller waves into nearshore areas, overtopping existing seawalls and  adding to the water collecting behind local dykes.     Flood risks can also be compounded by associated changes in soil and stream bank stability, leading to  landslides, channel collapse, and entrained debris in the flow area (Jacob et al. 2016).  Rare and dangerous  storms can cause precipitous change in shorelines and topography, posing significant threats to human health  and safety.   Many municipalities across Canada are challenged to both identify flood risks and to manage land use in  designated areas at risk due to the increased need for (SFU/Act 2014):   • updated and improved floodplain mapping, and technical information on flood hazards;   • data to close gaps on weather systems and local flood levels;   • research on projected changes in local and regional environmental conditions;   • inventories of local infrastructure and valued attributes;   • model guidelines for standardized, quantitative flood risk assessments that estimate expected   consequences and factor in the potential for cascading impacts;    • enhanced local capacity and/or access to expertise and experience;   • adequate funding for flood management;   • improved coordination of planning and governance across jurisdictions and sectors;    • fora to determine acceptable levels of risk tolerance, while recognizing that risk tolerances vary   geographically and socially;   • regional, strategic, adaptive, flexible and proactive flood management and mitigation strategies;   and/or   • tools for effective communication of risk to the public.       FLOOD MANAGEMENT TERMS    BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE): the 100-year flood   elevation that results in the elevation of wave crests   above the stillwater elevation resulting in wave runup   on shore and overtopping of seawalls.   DYNAMIC COASTAL FLOOD MODELING:  physics-  based computer simulations that incorporate factors   such as wind, atmospheric pressure, and friction in the   determination of coastal flood elevations (also known   as hydrodynamic modeling).    FLOOD EXCEEDANCE CURVES: the relationship   between flood intensity and different levels of   frequency. Each curve represents the flood intensity   that is anticipated will be equaled or exceeded once in   a prescribed number of years.   FLOOD HAZARD ASSESSMENT: the statistical   evaluation of the annual likelihood of a given flood   event for a range of different flood elevations.   FLOOD ZONE: a statistically-defined region whereby   each point within is subject to a flooding at a given   annual probability.    FLOODPLAIN: a broad, relatively flat land area subject   to flooding from a river, lake, ocean, or other water   body.   RETURN PERIOD/RECURRENCE: the average interval,   in years, between occurrences of two floods of equal   or greater magnitude, based on the probability that   the given flood event will be equaled or exceeded in   any given year.   STILLWATER ELEVATION: the water elevation during   a storm expressed as a combination of storm surge   and tide, but not including wave height.    WAVE SETUP: the rise in stillwater elevation that is   driven by the unidirectional effect of waves breaking,   thus pushing water onshore.

There is a wide array of models available for  estimating the risk of flood, and for calculating the direct and indirect damages and losses in areas vulnerable to  flooding.     Flood adaptation strategies have become a necessity for cities such as Surrey, British Columbia – where 20% of the  land area sits in the coastal floodplain, vulnerable to coastal and river flooding (Figure 8-7).        The City of Vancouver (2014) used the HAZUS model developed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency  (FEMA) in the United States, which is being adjusted for use in Canada by Natural Resources Canada (Lyle and Mills  2016).  HAZUS combines science and engineering with GIS (geographic information systems) technology to produce  estimates of hazard-related damages and loss.  While an adequate tool for estimating damage to structures, HAZUS  has been found to have more limited capacity to advance understanding of the tangible and intangible impacts to  human society and to individuals.                        TYPES OF FLOODING (Adapted from Dhonau et   al.  2015; GOV/UK/DEFRA 2007; Swiss Re 2016)   PLUVIAL FLOODING is generally the result of short   duration, localized precipitation events that can   equal the average rainfall of one or two months.    Torrential downpours overwhelm stormwater   systems, triggering flash floods in hilly areas, and   overland flooding in flatter locations.     FLUVIAL OR RIVERINE FLOODING, or overbank   flooding, occurs when downstream channels   receive more water from rain or snow melt, or from   dam or dyke failures, than they can accommodate.    GROUNDWATER FLOODING occurs when   infiltration of long and/or intense rainfall or   snowmelt elevates the water table resulting in   pooled water in low lying areas and flooded   basements and/or lower levels of buildings.    COASTAL FLOODING along marine coasts as well   as the shores of the Great Lakes is the result of   storm surges (high winds and air pressure changes   that push water towards the shore), as well as   higher waves, higher tides, and in some areas, land   subsidence and sea-level rise.  Coastal flooding can   also occur as a result of landslides and seismic   events.   RESERVOIR OR DAM FLOODING is rare in Canada   but can occur when reservoir containment or river   dams fail or are overtopped.    BURST WATER MAINS can release considerable   volumes of water, flooding streets and property   and causing structural and system damage.     SEWER FLOODING is caused by blockages in   sewer pipes, failures in equipment, too much   stormwater/floodwater in sanitary sewer systems,   and/or undersized sewers.  Sewage escapes from   piping through manholes, drains, or by backing up   into buildings through toilets, baths and sinks, and   flood drains.

Mercer Clarke).     13 | P a g e           Figure 8-7: Flood hazard mapping as prepared by the City of Surrey (City of Surrey 2017. used with permission).      14 | P a g e    8.2.4 MAPPING THE CHALLENGES   Data collection and analyses on key changes in environmental conditions can provide a solid foundation  for understanding the vulnerabilities and risks to human society and to natural environments.  However,  without some form of visualization of this information, or mechanisms to relate one data set to another,  knowledge may not be useful to decision-making.  Additionally, in some areas, available information  may not be relevant to the more local scale at which decisions need to be made (e.g., anticipated  changes in mean global annual temperature, national averages for sea-level rise).  Managing for rising  waters requires a wide range of information on topics as disparate as the capacity of existing stormwater  systems and the stability of local beach dune complexes.  Information on social vulnerability can direct  attention where management is needed most, and/or ensure the safety of less mobile sectors of the  population.     Geographic information systems (GIS) have become more affordable and easier to use, all while  developing increasingly sophisticated capacities for the storage and analysis of data and information.   Data entered into a GIS system can be analyzed and presented in statistical as well as visual formats,  improving understanding of trends and of cause and effect relationships (e.g. changes in river water  levels and expansion of flooding areas).  GIS systems also allow for the collection and inclusion of  traditional and local knowledge in improving understanding of past, current and potential future  changes.  GIS products are often used as valuable tools for communication to a wider, non-expert  audience (Figures 8-8, 8-9, 8-10) (UBC/CALP 2010).  Complex scenarios for future land use management,  and the direct and indirect consequences of failures to act responsibly, can be visually presented over a  range of alternative futures.                        FIGURE 8-8:  A subset of the 1 km2 tiles that form the digital   elevation topographic model built to estimate flood hazards in   Halifax Harbour (Forbes et al. 2009)   FIGURE 8-9:  A section of the ‘bare-earth’ digital elevation model for   part of Halifax Harbour displayed as a colour-coded shaded-relief   image, where the colours denote elevation ranging from dark blue   (sea level) to green, yellow, and orange (higher elevation) (Forbes et   al. 2009)     15 | P a g e    However, GIS tools are only as good as the data provided.  Many municipalities may  not as yet have compiled the needed information on environmental, economic, social  and cultural conditions that define their community.  Prior to the development of  options for management of rising waters, locally relevant data may be needed on:   • local geomorphology, stability and erosion and sedimentation processes,  including beach dynamics (e.g., beach composition, width and slope, area  and height of dunes and backshore areas);    • local, area and stability of wetlands and salt marshes, included trends in  habitat loss;   • tidal range (including seasonal extremes) and wave climate exposure (e.g.  wind fetch, geomorphology);   • volume of annual and seasonal riverine inputs, including sedimentation  levels;   • rate of local sea-level rise (including land subsidence);   • number, location and condition of existing shoreline protection measures  (e.g., groynes, seawalls, revetments);    • 25, 50 and 100-year flood zone area delineations, including storm surge  inundation zones and highest highwater lines for 10, 25, 50 and 100-year  storms;   • area of impervious surfaces and the number, size and condition of  stormwater detention basins and areas;    • water contamination sources (e.g., piped effluents, surface water, ground  water;   • land ownership, infrastructure and assets in potentially vulnerable areas;   • land cover and land use classification, zoning, setbacks and other land  management tools; and/or   • valued scenic vistas and views, cultural landscapes and historic sites of  significance.    Because data is loaded into GIS systems in ‘layers’, information on seemingly disparate  topics (e.g., aging populations, evacuation routes, flood vulnerability) can be easily  compared.  The risks of flooding can be readily co-related to the value of potentially  impacted real estate, improving understanding of the potential costs associated with  sea-level rise and/or storms, assisting in priority setting for action, and providing  valuable insight into future planning to reduce or avoid risks.  Visualization  technologies based on these tools can also be an important tool when communicating  risks.             FIGURE 8-10:  Flooding hazard limits as depicted by the Government of Ontario   (GOV/CAN/ON 2001)     16 | P a g e    LIDAR, DRONE, AND RTK   Many communities in Canada have access to topographic and bathymetric (depth of marine  waters) data, but in some the information can be dated or available at scales that do not  translate well to local risk assessment and flood planning (e.g., 1: 50,000).  In areas of the  country where topographic data and maps are provided by national and provincial  governments elevation changes may only be available in 5 metre contours, which is generally  insufficient for flood risk assessment and planning.  Three things basically determine how  vertically accurate mapping needs to be when assessing food risks:   • the terrain in the area (e.g., flat, rolling, steep);   • the perceived value (e.g., economic, social, environmental) of the assets at risk; and    • the resources available for the development of better mapping.   Flatter terrain may require more accuracy in mapping because even a small increase in water  levels can flood large areas.  Hillier terrain requires less vertical accuracy because small changes  in water levels will affect much less of the surrounding area.  Unless the assets under potential  threat of inundation have significant economic, social, cultural or ecological value, there may  not be a need to provide detailed documentation of the threat to their sustainability now or  into the future.  But perhaps most difficult of all, are the situations where the land is vulnerable  to flooding, the assets are important, and the community has few resources to purchase the  technology needed to produce better mapping.  Topographic data can be improved through a  number of approaches that range significantly in cost:   • LiDAR (light detection and ranging) technology records precise, three-dimensional  data on land, water and structures.  For topographic surveys, the LiDAR equipment is  mounted in aircraft which cover large areas in a relatively short time.  The costs to  obtain LiDAR data can be high, but sharing the initiative with other/nearby  communities can reduce the cost to each;   • Survey grade mapping drone technology, which can be used to provide elevation  information for smaller areas, can be much cheaper while still providing elevation data  accurate to within a few centimeters; and    • RTK (real time kinematic) surveys use Global Navigation Satellite systems to accurately  document topography in the immediate area.  RTK can be implemented by individuals  but is most useful when determining elevation data for specific sites.    It is important to determine the scale of information and the accuracy of the data needed  before moving to contract expensive survey operations to supplement publicly available  topographic information.  Then too, while LiDAR data may exist, it is not always freely available  and the costs to gain access can be substantial.          LiDAR (LIGHT DETECTION AND RANGING)    LiDAR is a remote sensing method that uses light in the form of a pulsed   laser to measure ranges (variable distances) to the Earth.  A LiDAR   instrument consists of a laser, a scanner, and a specialized GPS receiver.    Mounted in helicopters or other aircraft, LiDAR systems can use either a   near-infrared laser to map land topography, or a water-penetrating green   light to measure bathymetry such as seafloor and riverbed elevations.     When an airborne laser is pointed at a targeted area on the ground, the   beam of light is reflected by the surface it encounters.  A sensor records this   reflected light to measure a range.  When laser ranges are combined with   position and orientation data generated from integrated GPS and Inertial   Measurement Unit systems, scan angles, and calibration data, the result is   a dense, detail-rich group of elevation points, called a "point cloud."   Each point in the point cloud has three-dimensional spatial coordinates   (latitude, longitude, and height) that correspond to a particular point on the   Earth's surface from which a laser pulse was reflected.  The point clouds are   used to generate other geospatial products, such as digital elevation   models, canopy models, building models, and contours. LiDAR technology   allows scientists and decision-makers to examine both natural and man-  made environments with accuracy, precision and flexibility.

Forbes).     http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/lidar.html   17 | P a g e    8.3 CONFRONTING THE PROBLEM   Whether the threat of flooding is from heavy precipitation, overbank flooding and/or the combined  threats associated with higher levels in coastal water (e.g., sea-level rise, high tides, storm surge, wave  action), communities and individuals have generally only two choices, stay (persist) or leave (migrate)  (Figures 8-12, 8-13).    Persisting in place is not without cost.  Staying, or persisting in place, requires acceptance of the  intensifying impacts posed by rising waters to buildings and to activities, and/or initiation of (often  costly) efforts to protect those assets from flooding by improving stormwater management systems, by  waterproofing structures, by raising structures out of harm’s way, and/or by building protective  measures (e.g., dykes, levees, seawalls, groynes, breakwaters) to hold back the rising water.  As damage  from storm events and seas climbs and insurance claims rise, leaving may still not be a workable option  for homes and businesses that are threatened by changes in the environment, whether those changes  are the result of savage and immediate storms, or the slow onset of creeping hazards associated with  climate change.     Persisting in place has challenges, not the least of which is brevity of the useful lifespan of most efforts  undertaken today.  Protective measures will reduce the potential for impacts in the near term. However,  as seas continue to rise, and stormwater loads to increase, over the coming decades protective  measures will be less effective in preventing flooding, and migration to safer areas may become the  most viable option.              FIGURE 8-12:  Generic options for planning for sea-level rise and/or   flooding (Adapted from Nicholls 2011)   FIGURE 8-13:  Graphic depiction of the creeping hazard posed over time by rising sea-levels (Adapted from   GOV/USA/EPA 2009).     18 | P a g e    Adaptation efforts that intend to promote persisting in place should be guided by the following goals (Georgetown  Climate Center 2011):   • ACCOMODATION GOAL:  Continued use and development of lands deemed in harms way will be allowed  if structures and systems are built, retrofitted and/or operated so as to reduce risks and to become more  resilient to sea-level rise, severe weather and overland flooding.     • PROTECTION GOAL:  Protection of people, property and infrastructure from sea-level rise, severe weather  and overland flooding is the priority for adaptation efforts.  Hard engineered solutions (e.g., seawalls,  levees, dykes, shoreline armouring) will be used to reduce risks of damage and to ensure human health  and safety.     Persisting in place will require management of stormwater at source, improving the flood resilience of buildings  and systems, strengthening natural features to enhance their capacity for sheltering, and building protective  structures to reduce the potential for overland flooding.     Twelve key principles have been articulated for management of flood risks in urban areas (Jha et al. 2012):   • each scenario for flood risk is different, there is no one blueprint for action that works everywhere;   • planning and design for flooding must also address a changing and uncertain future;   • flood risk management should be integrated into regular urban planning and governance;   • integrated flood risk management must include a combination of structural and non-structural options;   • engineered flood risk management measures can transfer risk upstream and downstream or along coasts;   • it is entirely impossible to remove all risks of flooding;   • flood risk management approaches can have additional co-benefits beyond their primary mandate;   • flood risk management measures must also consider the wider implications to social and ecological  conditions;   • accepted responsibility for construction and maintenance of flood risk management measures is critical;    • implementation of flood risk management requires agreement and cooperation across multiple  stakeholders;   • continuing communication to ensure awareness and to reinforce preparedness is essential; and    • flood recovery is an essential element and must address the opportunities to build capacity.                             REGIONAL INITIATIVES PROGRAM   Since 2007, the Government of Canada, through   Natural Resources Canada, has been implementing   a cost-shared program with the Provinces and   Territories designed to help Canadians reduce the   risks and maximize the opportunities posed by   climate change.  Regional Adaptation   Collaboratives (RACs) on all coasts have been   working to develop resources and tools to aid in   adaptation.     Information developed by RAC teams and affiliates   is referenced throughout this primer.  Of relevance   to this Chapter, are three new reports released by   the Atlantic Climate Adaptation Solutions   Association (ACASA) that are intended to aid   communities in Atlantic Canada in efforts to plan   for and to adapt to rising waters.  While the   information is keyed to the east coast, readers will   find resources and information appropriate to a   wider audience.  Linkages to the reports by van   Proosdij et al. (2016), Manuel et al. (2016), and Leys   and Bryce (2016), have been included in the Web   Resources and Key Reports at the end of this   Chapter, as well being cited in the References.     19 | P a g e        FIGURE 8-14: The Government of Canada has disaster preparation and assistance   programs intended to assist Canadians in reducing the impacts of flood waters   and to respond to the financial needs of provinces and territories in the wake of   natural disasters, including the FLOODREADY program and the National Disaster   Mitigation Program.

Water in the flood fringe is generally shallower and flows more   slowly than in the floodway. New development in the flood fringe may be   permitted in some communities and should be flood proofed.   FLOOD HAZARD AREA:  The area affected by the design flood under   encroachment conditions. The flood hazard area is typically divided into   floodway and flood fringe zones and may also include areas of overland   flow.   FLOODWAY:  The portion of the flood hazard area where flows are   deepest, fastest and most destructive. The floodway typically includes the   main channel of a stream and a portion of the adjacent overbank area. The   floodway is required to convey the design flood. New development is   discouraged in the floodway and may not be permitted in some   communities. (Kovacs and Sandink 2013)   READYING FOR DISASTER   Planning for resilience must also address situations that can arise when   risks cannot be avoided.  While adaptation planning may focus on creating   resilient communities, all efforts must address readiness for disaster,   ensuring that resources are available, critical systems will operate and   recovery will be rapid and effective (GOV/USA/NAS 2012, 2013, 2015a,   2015b; Howes et al. 2013; UNISDR 2015).   https://www.canada.ca/en/campaign/flood-ready/communities.html?utm_source=Acart&utm_medium=FCMnewslett https://www.canada.ca/en/campaign/flood-ready/communities.html?utm_source=Acart&utm_medium=FCMnewslett   20 | P a g e    8.3.1 HOW WATER MOVES ACROSS THE LAND   Four characteristics of water are critical to how it performs in  the environment and how it can best be managed, whether it  falls continuously or sporadically:   • the way water collects on the land;    • the materials over which the water runs, including  vegetation;    • the steepness of the surface over which the water  drops, or flows;    • and the shape of the land in which the water collects.      When small amounts of water move slowly across a gentle slope  comprised of porous soils or vegetation, most of the water will  be absorbed.  If any of these conditions change, stormwater  movement also can change dramatically.  Larger volumes of  water, or water moving faster over steep grades, will flatten  vegetation and/or erode soft soils.  Large or small volumes of  water flowing quickly, or slowly over relatively hard or  impervious surfaces will not be absorbed (Figure 8-15)  (Thompson and Sorvig 2008)   In some Canadian communities, especially older cities with  combined storm and sanitary systems, intensive storm events  can result in sewer overflows when capacity is exceeded.   Overflows during peak rainfall events can result in untreated  municipal waste and contaminated urban runoff reaching local  watercourses and increasing the risk of contact with local  residents (CWN 2015), especially when the overflows empty to  parklands or to water bodies that serve as drinking water  sources.          STORMWATER: Water that accumulates on land as a result of precipitation events.  Impervious land cover   like roads, driveways, sidewalks and roofs prevent stormwater runoff from naturally soaking into the   ground, thereby creating faster and greater volumes of surface flows.  Stormwater can be contaminated   with nutrients from fertilizers and wastes, and with other pollutants such as pesticides and heavy metals.    Unmanaged stormwater can cause serious physical and chemical damage to ecosystems (e.g., streams,   wetlands, lakes and estuaries) and to property, particularly where land cover and land use change from   natural to rural, urban and/or industrial.  (Adapted from Peterson et al. 2010)   FIGURE 8-15:  The effects of land cover on the movement of rainfall through the hydrogeological cycle (adapted   from Schreier 2014).   IMPACTS OF INTENSIVE STORMWATER RUNOFF    • Lower rates of infiltration to groundwater   • Less snow, more rain may change the runoff/infiltration balance, altering base flow in streams,   especially spring run-off pulses   • Increased concentration of pollutants in surface water and groundwater    • Overcapacity flows in combined storm and sanitary sewer systems and treatment facilities   • More scour and erosion of natural watercourses   • More flooding in settled areas    • Overtopping of flood management infrastructure and containment ponds (e.g., dykes, dams,   detention basins, sewage treatment, farm manure management)    • Failures in septic systems      21 | P a g e    8.3.2 MANAGING STORMWATER   Stormwater accumulates either from steady periods of heavy rainfall, as the result of cloudburst  (i.e., short, intensive and localized periods of rain), or as a combination of precipitation with  snowmelt.  As the climate changes and weather patterns become more erratic, regions of the  country may be subject to periods of drought and periods of intense precipitation.  Stormwater  management systems in Canada were designed along established parameters typically derived from  historical averages for anticipated precipitation and have seldom been sized to contain and transport  stormwater from the increasingly frequent occurrence of 100-year storms.  Natural watercourses,  the eventual recipient of most stormwater, evolved to carry typical water loads; such as have been  the tradition of one in 10 or one in 25-year storms.  The unanticipated changes in precipitation  events and patterns that have been experienced in Canada in the past few decades have exceeded  the capacity of existing stormwater infrastructure and natural systems to carry the load, resulting in  overland flooding, sometimes in areas that have not experienced floods in the past.     Traditional methods for stormwater management were based on the conveyance of surface runoff  as quickly and directly as possible from the site to the nearest receiving natural watercourse (e.g.,  streams, lakes, rivers, wetlands, marine waters).  In general, runoff is channelled into pipes and  sewers, without consideration of entrained contaminants (including nutrients) that accumulated  from urban or rural land uses.  Because runoff is moved directly to the watercourse, during storm  events the water levels in those features reach peak flows quickly, contributing to increasing erosion  of stream banks and channel bottoms, suspending and transporting sediments, and diminishing  water visibility and water quality.  As peak flows from precipitation events are increasing with  climate change, the tendency has been to consider upsizing stormwater management piping to  address the higher flows.   Adapting to the changing conditions in precipitation events and in stormwater management will best  be achieved not by enlarging the capacity of stormwater systems, but by managing water where it  falls, rather than moving it quickly over impervious surfaces to discharge into the nearest receiving  natural environment (e.g., streams, lakes, wetlands, ocean).  Expertise in a range of approaches that  contribute to rainwater management (i.e., Low Impact Development, Green Streets) is growing,  inspiring new visions for urban living, and challenging stormwater managers to see what more can  be done with the water at hand.  Innovative planning and design are retrofitting inner city  neighbourhoods to create parks and waterways, to daylight piped streams and rivers, and to green  hard surfaces such as rooftops and parking areas (Porter-Bopp et al. 2011).  Stormwater  management has become a multi-functional planning and design approach to urban living.  Captured  rainfall, an integral element of urban living, can be a valued resource for livable cities, harvested to  support urban plantings, and to provide interest and variety to urban landscapes. Management of  stormwater through capture, infiltration and reuse, will reduce pressures on the flow capacity of  stormwater systems during peak events, reducing the potential for urban flooding, negating the  costs to upsize infrastructure, and improving water quality overall.     STORMWATER MANAGEMENT TERMS (Adapted from Kovacs   and Sandink 2013)   MINOR SYSTEM: Underground sewers, catch basins and other   drainage works that convey stormwater from minor storms.  Minor   storms have been considered to be those with a return period of   5 years or less.    MAJOR SYSTEM: The drainage system in place to convey   stormwater from major storms (100 Year), including municipal   infrastructure, but relying also on managing flows across private   and public property through lot grading, roadways and water   storage facilities.     MASTER DRAINAGE PLAN: Municipal and regional plans that   ensure development of an optimal drainage system to meet   present and future stormwater drainage requirements.    SEWER BACKUP: Sewers flowing in a surcharged condition can   result in the backup of water with the potential to cause basement   flooding and structural damage. This risk is increased when   weeping tiles and roof leaders are connected to the sewer system.   BACKWATER VALVE:  A backflow prevention valve that prevents   sewage from backing up into property through the sewer lateral.    COMBINED SEWER:  A sewer intended to receive both   stormwater and wastewater.   SANITARY SEWER:  A sewer intended to receive human   wastewater.   STORMWATER SEWER:  A sewer intended to receive only   stormwater.   SANITARY SEWER OVERFLOW:  A discharge to the environment   from a sanitary sewer system.   COMBINED SEWER OVERFLOW:  A discharge to the   environment from a combined sewer system.   RISK REDUCTION GOAL:  A goal used when practical, stormwater   management focused on reduction in stormwater runoff through   limitation of impervious surfaces, and/or collection at source for   storage, reuse, infiltration and/or slow release to the environment.    Efforts are made to attain acceptable water quality before release.     22 | P a g e    The simplest and most successful rules for stormwater management are (Table  8-2) (Thompson and Sorvig 2008):   • deal with stormwater first where it falls (i.e., impoundments, pervious  pavements);   • use vegetation to slow water flow and to improve water quality before  it reaches groundwater or surface waters;    • provide vegetated buffers to natural channels, avoid straightening from  natural configurations, do not harden the channels and find ways to  reduce the first flush quantity of water generated by storm events;    • store water where it falls to allow for evaporation, infiltration and for  reuse in the landscape;    • isolate and treat runoff from pollutant collecting pavements (e.g., gas  stations, storage pads);    • make stormwater retention useful and beautiful; and above all,    • reduce paved and impervious surfaces, including setting a maximum  width for streets.

STORMWATER POLICY ADAPTATION    • Update provincial stormwater management requirements to require flow   reduction and management and to ensure water quality entering surface   waters    • Update watershed and sub-watershed management plans ahead of any   proposed expansion of urban boundaries, or any major urban   development or redevelopment to ensure that adequate care has been   taken to assess the cumulative effects of climate change   • Advance stormwater management that promotes control at source   through low impact development (LID), system resilience to severe storm   events, and the promotion of green infrastructure   • Require incorporation of LID principles and resilience to climate change   in all new development, including urban design, roads and buildings.    Require the same of retrofit projects. Link requirements to funding   opportunities   • Separate stormwater and sanitary wastewater systems    • Provide for treatment of stormwater before disposal to the environment    • Ensure that natural landscapes important to retention and filtering of   runoff from developed lands (e.g., wetlands) and to the safe passage of   floodwaters (e.g., floodplains) are protected and/or restored to ensure   their effective functioning     23 | P a g e    8.3.3 LOW IMPACT DEVELOPMENT (LID)    Sometimes implementation of low impact development practices requires a new  vision for land development and water storage and movement.  Sometimes it  provides needed justification to abandon perceptions that wider roads and larger  parking lots are best.  Most LID initiatives are based on the principle of  stormwater as a resource that should be captured, harvested and reused (Figures  8-16, 8-17).  LID approaches can create livable spaces in which stormwater  management systems are integral components of greening cities and streets – a  win-win situation that provides many related benefits to city dwellers and to local  environments (City of Edmonton 2011).  Many communities are adopting a low  impact development approach in switching from traditional stormwater  management initiatives to rainwater management.  Rainwater management  focuses on creating more positive relationships between urban drainage and  ecosystems (GOV/CAN/BC 2011), and includes LID approaches such as:   • collecting, storing, reusing and/or infiltrating rainwater to reduce the  volume of runoff;   • minimizing the area of disturbed lands, and maintaining natural buffers  around aquatic resources;    • minimizing impervious land cover through design practice and the use  of alternative (pervious) pavements;    • reducing opportunities for soil compaction; and    • creating rain gardens, bio-swales, improved street tree planting  methods.         PERMEABLE PAVING refers to a range of sustainable materials and techniques that   utilize a base and subbase to allow the movement of stormwater through the surface.    In addition to reducing runoff, permeable pavements can effectively trap suspended   solids and filter pollutants from the water (adapted from Wikipedia).   Permeable pavements have become much more than pavements with spaces for water   penetration.  New developments in concrete and other materials have developed   pavement materials through which water can pass unobstructed.     LOW IMPACT DEVELOPMENT (LID)   Low Impact Development is an innovative approach to land development that mimics   the natural movement of water to manage stormwater (rainwater and urban runoff)   close to where it falls   LID uses small, simple design techniques and cost-effective landscape features that   allow water to infiltrate, filter, store, evaporate, and detain runoff located at the lot level.

Green Street designs begin with narrower streets and often include multi-use pathways and  drainage swales that receive runoff from non-permeable pavements (Figure 8-18).  Not only  do these approaches reduce the volume and slow the pace of stormwater runoff, they enhance  groundwater, improve the quality of fresh water receiving environments (e.g., streams, lakes,  wetlands), reduce peak flow pressures on stormwater infrastructure, improve air quality,  reduce urban heat effects, and reduce the need for stormwater treatment.    Along urban streets, greater attention is being given to enhancing the well-being of street   trees, and improving infiltration of rainwater through the use of bioswales.                       ROADS AND RUNOFF   In traditional settlements in much of Canada, roads were narrower, and   often followed local topography rather than grid patterns.  While these   meandering paths may not be as efficient as modern connectors, repairing   rather than replacing traditional road networks can have value.  Narrower   streets slow traffic, generate less runoff, improve aesthetics and raise   property values.     Efforts to improve roads in areas of steep slope can require significant cut   and fill.  On a 30% slope, widening the paved area by as little as a foot on   either side can increase fill requirements by more than 60%, and increase   the width of the road footprint by more than 10 feet.  For every inch of   rain that falls, the addition of two feet of pavement to the road surface   would add 700 gallons of runoff for every mile of road.  This runoff must   now go somewhere.  (Thompson and Sorvig 2008)   FIGURE 8-18:  Sample guidelines for green street dimensions (Adapted from City of Ottawa: Available at   http://ottawa.ca/sites/ottawa.ca/files/migrated/files/con040683_123462995.jpg ).   http://ottawa.ca/sites/ottawa.ca/files/migrated/files/con040683_123462995.jpg   26 | P a g e    BIOSWALES are created when land is contoured to create positive overland drainage to a collection area, that   provides improved infiltration to soils and to groundwater.  In urban areas, the relatively unused land between   the street edge and the sidewalk is renovated to provide storage for the slow release of rainwater and planted   with hardy and aesthetic species that reduce the concentrations of silt and urban pollutants in the water.   (Figures 8-19, 8-20).                           FIGURE 8-19: Use of street edge as bioswale and   planting area. (Image Credit: Wikimedia Commons.   USA/EPA. Public Domain).    BIOSWALES are landscape elements designed to   concentrate or remove silt and pollution out of   surface runoff water. They consist of a swaled   drainage course with gently sloped sides (less than   6%) and filled with vegetation, compost and/or   riprap. (Wikipedia)   FIGURE 8-20: Typical parking lot/street edge design for bioswale installation (University of Michigan School for Environment   and Sustainability, CC BY 2.0).     27 | P a g e    8.3.5 IMPROVING RESILIENCE TO FLOODING   Accommodation to flooding can be passive or active.  Passive accommodation accepts that  areas will be inundated periodically, limiting the use of the site until waters recede.   Designated flood plain areas, parking lots, open fields and forests, recreation fields are all  examples of urban land uses that can be flooded without incurring significant costs for loss  of access or damage.  Active accommodation to flooding usually requires retrofitting  existing assets, and/or application of new design and construction standards to new  development, to reduce their vulnerability and enhance their resilience to flooding.     Four significant factors determine preparation and response to anticipated flooding:   • Flood Depth:  The depth of water anticipated to occur at specific locations.   Higher water depths can threaten human health and safety, and/or cause damage  to building walls and foundations.    • Flood Duration: The length of time flood waters can be expected to remain.   Temporary measures can deal with short term flood, but longer periods of  inundation provide water with more opportunities to seep into structures and  systems and threaten the long-term health and safety of humans.     • Flood Onset:  The time it takes for overland and other flood waters to reach a  location from the source of the flooding.  Short-onset flooding (flash floods) are  particularly dangerous because there is too little time to warn the public or to  protect assets.    • Flood Frequency: How often flooding might be expected to occur, complicated  now by climate induced environmental changes.  Frequent shallow floods may be  dealt with by localized protection or altered use.  Less frequent but deeper floods  may require retrofit for existing structures, rezoning to prevent new construction,  and/or updated building codes.      Water can enter a building through several avenues including (GOV/UK/DEFRA  2007)    • groundwater seepage through foundations and basement and cellar floors;   • air vents and gaps around windows and doors;   • gaps around pipes and cables that pass through walls and floors;   • backflow through overloaded drainage and sewer systems;   • foundation walls above the waterproof treatment; and/or   • permeable brickwork, cracked bricks, and/or weathered or damaged  mortar.    In addition to moving the structure, or providing protection walls, decision-makers  can choose between two strategies for improving the resilience of structures to  flood waters (Figure 8-21):   • Water Exclusion (Dry flood-proofing): water entry to buildings is  prevented, structural integrity is maintained and the use of materials and  construction techniques that facilitate drying and cleaning is promoted.   Most appropriate for areas where anticipated flood conditions will not  exceed water depths of 0.3m.   • Water Entry/Exit (Wet flood-proofing): flood waters can enter the building  however provisions have been made for easier exit and draining and for  drying when flood water recedes.  Favoured where high flood levels are  possible, as standard masonry buildings can be at significant risk of  structural damage when the difference in water levels between the outside  and the inside of the building exceed 0.6 metres.   FIGURE 8-21:  Basic options to avoid and/or reduce flood damage to structures   (GOV/CAN/ECCC: Accessible at: https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-  change/services/water-overview/quantity/reducing-flood-damage.html ).   https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/water-overview/quantity/reducing-flood-damage.html https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/water-overview/quantity/reducing-flood-damage.html   28 | P a g e    Structures can vary in their vulnerability to flooding, depending on factors such  as (City of New York 2013):   • the kind of flooding experienced (e.g. storm surge, wave action, overland  flooding);   • the physical characteristics of the structure (e.g., building height,  construction type);   • how the building is used (e.g., residential, industrial, health services);   • the mechanical and electrical equipment housed in basements or lower  floors (e.g., electrical panels, water, wastewater, heating/cooling  systems, electronics);   • the design and construction regulations in effect at the time of  construction or renovation; and    • the age of the structure.   Resilience in structures can be improved through:    • application of damp-proof membranes and other water-proofing  measures to foundation, basement, and cellar walls;   • elevated thresholds on doors;   • use of closed cell insulation in flood prone areas;   • installation of sump pumps to assist with local drainage and to facilitate  dewatering after flooding;   • elevation of electrical services (e.g., sockets) and location of building  services on levels less vulnerable to flooding;   • use of water resistant construction materials in floors, foundations,  windows and doors; and    • provision of additional protection measures for lower level utilities and  systems.     When selecting construction materials for use in flood prone areas, careful  attention should be paid to the following characteristics (GOV/UK/DEFRA 2007)  (Table 8-3):   • Water penetration:  the rate and volume of water that can seep through  the material;    • Drying ability: the capacity for the material to regain its original moisture  content (as determined by the average amount of time needed to dry);  and    • The ability to return to pre-flood dimensions and integrity, without  deformation or (significant) change in form or in the appearance of the  material.

Common sense actions include prohibition of use of lower levels in  buildings as residential areas, or for the storage and/use of expensive  electronics and/or furnishings.  However, flooding of residential  basements continues to rise in Canada, as do the insurance claims for  damages.

Overland flooding such as this is typically not covered by property insurance in Canada.  Water   damage to structures has historically only been covered by private insurers if the water   originated from a sewer backup.     Some insurers in Canada now offer Overland Water Protection coverage for damage caused   when ground water enters a dwelling through the foundation, basement floors, or walls   and/or sewer line.  This coverage includes damage caused by flooding from fresh water, such   as overflows of rivers, lakes or other bodies of water, or damage from the sudden   accumulation of water due to heavy rainfall, spring run-off or natural overflow of a dam, levee   or dyke.   FIGURE 8-22:  Range of risks and insurance coverage for water damage in homes in Canada (Adapted   from Feltmate et al., 2017).     30 | P a g e    8.3.6 STRENGTHENING NATURAL FEATURES   Throughout the country, flooding and other damage from extreme weather and rising seas is increasingly putting valuable property and vulnerable populations in harm’s way.   On coasts (including the Great Lakes) and along streams, rivers and wetlands, erosion resulting from sea-level rise, storm surges, wave actions and increased flows can  significantly alter river channels, deltas, beach and dune complexes, offshore islands and reefs and barrier beaches.  Storm conditions can rapidly destabilize shorelines and  unprotected river banks, leading to major changes in erosion and sedimentation patterns.  Entire beaches and dune complexes can be lost during one storm event, or a season  of unusual weather, with little opportunity remaining for their (natural) return.  Erosion along coastal and riverine environments can result in:   • steadily increasing or catastrophic losses in land area and/or in land stability;   • increased risks to the structural viability of existing buildings and valued property;    • loss of natural sea defences such as dune systems and barrier beaches; and    • loss or impairment of engineered protection measures (e.g., breakwaters, seawalls).   Since Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans in 2012, interest has been growing in the role played by natural features (e.g., offshore reefs, beaches and dunes, flood plains,  deltas, wetlands, seagrass beds and shoreline and bankside vegetation,) in attenuating wave energy and storm surges, preventing erosion, and containing flood waters.     Salt marshes and wetlands can dissipate wind and wave energy, increase sedimentation, and reduce erosion and sediment movement.  As water passes through the vegetation,  flow velocities and turbulence are reduced.  Wetland plants improve water quality, and their roots anchor sediments.  Offshore reefs and islands, barrier beaches and  beach/dune complexes work to dissipate wave energy and are part of the natural processes that provide sand and cobble resources to replenish beaches.  Coastal and riverine  trees, shrubs and plants are critical to maintaining channel character, and river bank and dune stability.  In the shallow nearshore, marine seagrass beds increase capture and  settlement of sediments, and prevent erosion of the shoreline.  Most natural features also contribute additional services to society in the form of improved water quality and  maintenance of amenities (e.g., beaches, tourism infrastructure, waterfront homes) (Arkema et al. 2013).   Despite growing understanding of the importance of natural systems (e.g., riffle-run alignments in rivers, delta and  estuarine dynamics, erosion and sedimentation in beaches and dunes, and longshore sediment drift patterns),  society continues to develop in ways that can result in their disruption, deterioration and/or loss.  As a result, piped  and channelized streams and rivers are increasingly unable to support the challenges posed by increasingly severe  weather and increasingly intensive flows.  Foreshore dune complexes necessary to the continued replenishment  of beaches are disappearing, and coastal geomorphology is changing at rates not previously experienced.        Cavendish backshore dunes, Prince Edward Island (Image Credit:  Adapted from WikiPedia CC BY-SA 3.0)   CONSERVATION GOAL:  Natural features will,  where practical, be preserved and enhanced for  natural resource and habitat values and to ensure  sustainability of habitats and functions.  Special  care will be taken for areas under threat of severe  weather and sea-level rise to facilitate inland  migration as water levels rise.       31 | P a g e    The economic benefits of protecting, restoring and/or enhancing natural features  (i.e., soft engineering) as a component of strategic responses to climate change is  relatively poorly documented.  Recent research by Arkema et al. (2013) has  identified that, for the State of Florida alone, protecting existing nearshore habitats  and coral reefs could reduce anticipated damage to real estate from sea-level rise  by $4 Billion (US).  In much of Canada, shoreline and nearshore vegetation (e.g.,  coastal forests, bankside vegetation, wetlands, salt marshes, algae and seagrass  beds) are not generally valued or protected.  On-going threats to these systems  compromise their resilience to impacts, and their capacity to shelter ecosystems and  society from the full onslaught of changing conditions.  In some areas of the country,  sea levels are rising faster than marshes can accommodate.  In other locations, sea- level rise combined with landward topography may prevent marshes from migrating  inland, resulting in catastrophic loss of the marsh, and exposure of the previously  sheltered lands to wave and tide action.  Changes in water chemistry, resulting from  climate change, threaten marine plants and animals, and cloudburst contributions  of rainwater result in flash flooding, channel erosion, and landslides along the banks  of streams and rivers.  There is an increasingly desperate need to improve our  understanding of the role that natural systems play in enhancing ecological and  societal resilience to storms and rising seas, preferably before they are damaged or  lost to development pressure, and/or water contamination.     Traditional approaches to reduce stormwater, to raise dams and levees, and to  flood proof buildings can be expensive and costly to maintain, yet hard  engineering solutions (e.g., breakwaters, seawalls, larger pipes) tend to be the  first line of defence against changing conditions, especially along marine  shorelines experiencing damage and flooding from storm surges.  What is  needed is a more inclusive examination of the existing and potential capacity  of natural features to assist in ameliorating the impacts of flooding associated  with climate change, and a careful understanding of the costs and benefits of  all approaches.  Clearly, natural features will not be helpful in some areas, such  as highly exposed coastlines, where only engineered solutions may protect  resources at least for a time.  But in those areas already sheltered by salt  marshes, river deltas, and/or beach and dune complexes, careful stewardship  of existing resources could reduce current impacts, and put off to the future  the need to either engineer protective measures and/or to move away from  the shore (Figure 8-23).     As conditions continue to change, a multi-pronged approach that weighs the  benefits of working with natural systems against the costs of engineered  solutions and the stability of engineered solutions against the loss of the  natural coastline (Figures 8-23, 8-24, 8-25, 8-26, Table 8-4) could offer  flexibility to many communities facing rising waters.

Mercer Clarke     35 | P a g e    While there is value in protecting and maintaining natural systems, there can also be significant costs.  Beach nourishment and dune replacement programs can require   annual replenishment of large quantities of sand which can only be justified where there are significant economic gains to be made (e.g., tourism).  Mining sand from the   seabed may not be environmentally sustainable and could impact both the marine ecosystems where the sand is sourced, and damage ecosystems where the sand is placed.    Mining sand from land-based sources will change the natural strata of the beach and may require significant resources for transportation and placement.  Dune restoration is   an emerging science, that requires expert knowledge of local coastal geomorphology as well as patterns for long shore drift, and weather and wave exposure.  Phillips and   Jones (2006) noted that in the previous 10 years, Italy had used 20 million cubic metres of sand to nourish its beaches, and Britain had replaced over 20 million tonnes.    Prices quoted for annual beach replenishment have been estimated at US$ 4-15/m3.  When working to restore either beaches or dunes, the costs will be affected by factors   such as (Linham and Nichols 2010):    • the size of the project, with benefits from economies of scale and detriments when sourcing for large  quantities of sand is difficult from single sites;   • the distance and number of journeys required to transport sand between the supply site and the  deposition site;   • where seabed mining is permitted, the depth and shape of the sea bed, the dredge equipment required,  the availability of the equipment, and the number of days the recovery site or the deposition site will be  subject to bad weather;   • tidal range on the deposition beach, which constrains working hours;    • the type of beach material needed (some beach replenishment projects may be on coarser gravel or  cobble beaches);   • estimated loss of materials during sourcing, transportation and placement, including losses to coastal  erosion;    • the costs to revegetate and/or to fence and enforce restrictions on use in new beach and dune areas;    • the costs for planning and design, including the costs for any required environmental impact assessment,  regulatory approvals, and/or monitoring during and after construction; and    • the frequency with which the beach or dunes must be artificially replenished as opposed to gaining some  capacity for natural accumulation.    Before attempting any form of physical shoreline restoration, it is critical that  appropriate technical expertise be included in planning and design efforts.  Some  areas of Canada have naturally eroding beaches, in which longshore patterns of  erosion and deposition can change the character of the shore over time.  In other  areas, beach profile and beach substrate differ radically between the ‘winter’ beach  and the ‘summer’ beach.  Sand and stones erode from the beach during active  weather (e.g., larger waves and winter storms), are deposited offshore, and returned  once again during quieter water in the spring and summer.         Dune restoration on the Pacific Coast (Image Credit: Parks Canada)     36 | P a g e    8.4 HOLDING THE LINE   One of the most traditional approaches in Canada to the problems of rising water is to build structures to hold the  water back, to prevent erosion and to ensure the safety of people and property.  Construction of flood barriers,  revetments, dykes, seawalls, groynes, breakwaters and other options for hard armouring of the coast can still be  an effective measure to protect shorelines and to defend against storm damage.  However hard armouring requires  expert design and management, can be expensive, creates a large footprint for construction, and can result in  interference with natural shoreline processes, habitat destruction and loss of public access to the water edge.   Perhaps most importantly, hard armouring of shores must increasingly be seen as a temporary option for many  locations.  As sea levels rise and storms become more intense and frequent, building walls to protect low lying  property or to prevent land erosion will become less feasible, less effective and more expensive (Figure 8-27).   Todays breakwater or seawall may well be tomorrow’s reef.     Armouring, defending, and/or protecting are all terms that have been used interchangeably to describe the process  of holding the line against flood waters.  The barriers used to prevent wave and water action from eroding river  banks and coastlines, and to keep flood waters from damaging environments or property generally fall into the  following categories:    • flood barriers;   • dykes and levees;   • revetments;   • seawalls;   • groynes/artificial headlands/shoreline stabilization measures; and   • offshore breakwaters, islands and reefs;   It will be increasingly important to note that, in some situations in Canada, development in, at or near vulnerable  areas has reduced and/or complicated the options available for protection from flood waters (Figure 8-28).  The  past century of relatively stable weather and climate conditions have entrenched what are now unrealistic  expectations on the capacity for planners and designers to provide options that ensure the continued stability,  use, and safety of all structures in all environments.  Even in those areas where an engineered solution is possible,  the costs for construction and maintenance, together with the potential disruption to communities and to natural  environments, will not be merited for installations with a limited lifetime of practical use.                          FIGURE 8-27:  Coastal highway in British Columbia   leaves few options for adaptation but relocation.    (Image Credit: Mills NRCan).   FIGURE 8-28:  Would you buy this house?  It has a great view,   limited options for protection from floodwaters, and   consequently, a short life expectancy.     (Image Credit: Essex Region Conservation Authority, used with   permission.

Rivers establish vertical and horizontal profiles for the movement of water, including complex, and repeating  patterns of pools and fast water (riffle-run sequences).  Interference in riverine hydraulics by altering the channel  configuration, hardening river banks or bottoms, inserting water control structures, and/or piping sections of the  stream, will disrupt some upstream processes and most downstream processes.  It may take years for the river to  return to a stable condition.     Along marine coasts and the shores of the Great Lakes and other large water bodies, longshore transport or drift  of sediments can alternatively erode shorelines and create landforms such as beaches, bars, spits, and barrier  islands (Figure 8-31).  Longshore transport of sediments often occurs in well-established littoral cells along  designated sections of a coastline.  In some areas of Canada, wave action, currents and nearshore ice can impact  coasts, moving not only sand, but also cobble and rock.  While some movement of sediment is normal, significant  erosion can result in major changes in geomorphology.  Hard armouring of eroding shorelines can prevent erosion  and stabilize near shore lands but armouring also interrupts the balance in erosion and sedimentation processes  and can have significant impacts on the viability for depositional features of the coast such as beaches, sandbars,  and offshore islands.     Land and gravel beaches naturally require constant  replenishment of materials to maintain the balance  between erosion and sedimentation.  Some of this  material is supplied from local dunes and eroding  shores, and some is transported from some distance  by longshore currents and wave action.  On Lake Erie,  much of the North shore has been hardened to  prevent erosion, loss of land, and/or damage to  property.  Prominent natural features such as  beaches and dunes are now eroding, because the  sediment source has been interrupted (Figure 8-32).   Similar situations occur on marine coasts when  inappropriate placement of protection measures  (maladaptation) such as revetments, seawalls,  breakwaters and groynes can interfere with both  longshore and cross shore sedimentation and erosion  processes.           LONGSHORE SEDIMENT DRIFT   Breaking waves and surf in the nearshore can   combine with a number of horizontal and vertical   nearshore currents to transport sediments along   the coast.  Sometimes this results only in a local   rearrangement of sediment into bars and troughs   or a series of rhythmic patterns along the beach.  In   more pronounced cases, thousands of cubic metres   of sediment can be displaced along the shore each   year.  Longshore drift is one of the most important   of coastal processes and is a significant   determinant of where shores erode, accrete or   remain stable.  (GOV/USACE 2008)   CROSS SHORE TRANSPORT OF SEDIMENT   Cross shore transport is the movement of   nearshore and beach sediment (sand) towards or   away from the shore and is the result of the   combined action of tides, winds, waves and   currents.  Cross-shore transport is important to the   sustainability of beaches and contributes to the   formation of winter and summer beach profiles.   COASTAL GEOLOGY AND GEOMORPHOLOGY   encompasses the origin, structure and   characteristics of the bedrock, rock and sediments   that characterize a shoreline.  Coastal sediments   can range from tiny particles of sand or silt to larger   gravels and cobble and may include consolidated   formations of sediment and rock. Some sediments   may be highly erodible, some resistant to erosive   forces.   COASTAL PROCESSES (wind, waves, tides   currents).  The physical processes that act upon and   shape the coastline, and that influence the   configuration, orientation and movement of   coastal landform.  (GOV/USA/FEMA 2011)   FIGURE 8-29: Longshore movement of sediments      38 | P a g e    Even without barriers to erosion and sedimentation, beaches can naturally change over years  and seasonally as a result of both nearshore and cross-shore transport of sediment.  The  granular composition of some oceanic beaches can alter over time from predominantly sand  to predominantly stone or cobble as finer sediments are moved by wave action and longshore  transport along the coastline.     In some high wave energy areas, winter storms remove most of the sand and rearrange cobbles  on beaches, depositing them in deeper offshore waters and dramatically altering the beach  profile (Figure 8-30).  This entirely natural and recurring seasonal phenomenon can provide an  emotional shock to beach visitors who become alarmed when visiting their favourite shoreline  in winter, who may have difficulty believing that, with the return of calmer weather in the  spring, the beach will also be restored to its summer profile in time for vacationing.     Rocky shorelines are also affected by wave action and erosion, which can eat away at bluffs,  creating islands, caves and arches.  In some areas wave and current action can destabilize the  toe of embankments and cliffs, resulting in significant landslides and shoreline reconfiguration.   While most of the shaping of coastlines happens over decades or even longer timeframes, a  single intense storm event can result in dramatic reshaping of the shore.                                       FIGURE 8-30: Seasonal changes in beach profiles. As wave   energy increases in winter storms, sand and gravels are   eroded from the beach area and deposited in berms in   deeper water.  With the return of calmer weather in the   summer, the eroded material is once again deposited on   the beach.    Eroding coastal bluff at Eastport NL (Image Credit: C.

Failure to address all the  environmental factors that can and will affect flood protection measures inevitably result in structures that are  time-limited in their usefulness, that destroy rather than enhance local habitats, that reduce access to local water  resources; and that are inherently unsightly.     Maladaptation is the term for poorly planned and executed adaptation efforts that not only provide an ineffective  solution to the problem at hand, they limit the options for other solutions, both now and in the future.  Too often  maladaptation occurs because of:   • too little attention to planning and design because of the rush for immediate action;    • in sufficient understanding of important factors that are or will contribute to the problem at hand;   • application of generic solutions, rather than solutions that are place-based; and   • lack of financial resources and needed expertise.                                                     MALADAPTATION   A process of planning, design or construction that   can directly or indirectly increase rather than   reduce vulnerability to climate variability and   change, and/or that could significantly undermine   the capacity or opportunities for present and future   adaptation.

Mercer Clarke).     40 | P a g e    8.4.3 THE NEED FOR INTERDISCIPLINARY PLANNING AND DESIGN   Most shoreline defense initiatives require planning and design by interdisciplinary teams that include planners,  landscape architects, ecologists and coastal engineers.  Planning ensures that all design fits with the overall plan  for the community or the location, and accounts for the many social and commercial perspectives of a community  (Figure 8-32).  Landscape architects bridge between the natural environment and the built environment, ensuring  that structures enhance community resilience but not at the cost of damage to the environment or loss of cultural  values and aesthetics.  Ecologists and professionals from other natural sciences ensure existing environmental  processes are respected, and all opportunities for enhancing the sustainability of ecosystem services to the  community are realized.  Coastal engineering is a special discipline of civil engineering that requires technical  knowledge of the structural and non-structural options and must account for the potential for positive and  negative impacts on coastal environments and societies.  To avoid catastrophic damage to systems and to society,  in ALL situations where structural options (large or small) are being assessed, interdisciplinary teams are  responsible for consideration of the impacts of processes such as (GOV/USACE 2008):   • environmental (chemical, biological, ecological);   • hydrodynamic (wind, waves, water level changes, sea-level change, currents);   • meteorological (seasonal storms, hurricanes, changing weather patterns, shifts in local climate);   • sedimentary (sources, transport paths, sinks, material characteristics);   • geological (soils, bedrock, land subsidence, groundwater); and   • social and political (land use, public access, development trends, regulatory instruments, pubic safety,  property values, local and regional economics).                                      FIGURE 8-32:  Hard armouring must not only be designed to withstand rising   water levels and increasing wave and current energy, it must also strive to protect   and enhance natural habitats and to continue the traditions of public access to the   shore. Is this a good or bad result?  (Image Credit: Wikipedia Oikos Team Public   Domain)    “An interdisciplinary team approach is   recommended in planning coastal projects to   ensure the involvement of physical, natural and   social sciences personnel.     The disciplines of the coastal project planners   should be appropriate to the problems and   opportunities identified in the planning process,   and range from coastal, geotechnical, structural   and hydraulic engineers, through meteorologists,   oceanographers, biologists and geologists, to   economists, urban planners and transportation   specialists.     Not all disciplines are needed on all studies, but   the team leader needs to be cognizant of the   possible need for such talents during the project   development.”   The Coastal Engineering Manual, US Army Corps of   Engineers (GOV USACE 2008: EM 1110-2-1100, V-1-1)     41 | P a g e    8.4.4 REVETMENTS   A revetment is a facing of stone, concrete or other durable material placed on shorelines, banks or cliffs to  absorb the energy of moving water and waves to protect the slope and to prevent erosion (Figures 8-33).   Modern revetment design requires much more than piling stone along the shoreline.  Revetments are  designed to account for local water movement and sedimentation processes and constructed of materials  selected and sized to withstand local water energy (waves, currents) and to prevent displacement of the  revetment materials.  An integral component of revetment construction is the use of geo-textiles to  separate the revetment material from the underlying slope (Figure 8-33).  Geo-textiles stabilize the new  slope and prevent storm waves from eroding base materials.      Each revetment must be constructed upon a stable foundation, the core of which is the toe of the slope.  If  the toe materials are undermined or eroded by waves and currents, the entire revetment will become  unstable.  While traditional revetment materials used a range of appropriately sized stone, modern  revetments can also employ concrete formed structures such as tetrapods.  A tetraopod is a tetrahedral  (four-legged) concrete structure designed to dissipate the force of incoming waves by allowing water to  flow around rather than against it, and to reduce displacement in the revetment by allowing a random  distribution of tetrapods to mutually interlock.     Increasingly, revetment materials are being selected based on their capacity to mimic existing  environmental conditions, and to provide the basis for recolonization by marine and aquatic species and  other coastal vegetation and wildlife.

Wikipedia Commons CC BY-SA 3.0)     42 | P a g e    8.4.5 SEAWALLS   Seawalls are vertical walls constructed to protect land and structures from high tides, storm surges,  wave action and changing water levels.  Seawalls (which can be deployed on both freshwater and  marine shorelines) can be temporary or permanent and may be constructed from a range of  materials (e.g., stone, concrete, metal, wood).   The constructed costs for most vertical seawalls can be affected by factors that include (Linhan and  Nicholls 2016);   • design height which also affects the footprint required for the wall and any associated  structures, as well as the time needed for construction;   • anticipated wave energy dictates the resilience required in materials and construction with  walls intended for deeper waters and more exposed coasts requiring more robust  materials;   • type of seawall design selected;   • construction materials (e.g., rubble blocks, pre-cast concrete elements, metal, soil) and  availability;   • single or multi-stage construction methods and complications (e.g., needed de-watering,  footprint stabilization); and    • expert planning and design services, together with construction inspection services.      Seawalls can serve many purposes.  When incorporated into the landscape in an aesthetic design,  they become art forms (Figure 8-34).  When integrated to serve additional waterfront functions,  seawalls can become the foundation for innovative approaches that restore the semblance of a  natural coastline while improving public access to the waterfront.     Cities like Vancouver have historically made their seawalls a part of the community.  The 28 km  Greenway in Vancouver, an uninterrupted pathway, runs over sections of the seawall, and is  amongst the most popular recreational spots in the city (Figure 8-35).

Flood barriers may protect large expanses of the landscape or may be  employed to protect specific property or low-lying structures of importance.  Tidal gates  or storm surge barriers may only close during anticipated high-water periods.     Perhaps the most famous of recent projects to construct tidal barriers to sea-level rise  and storm surges is the Thames River Barrier in the United Kingdom.  Protecting the City  of London and the surrounding area from higher high tides and storm surges, the Barrier  is the world’s second largest moveable flood barrier.  Used only during high tides, the  Barrier remains open to marine traffic during low water periods.  Similar approaches  have been deployed in the Netherlands (Delta Project), in Venice (MOSE Project), and  in New Orleans LA (IHNC Lake Borgne Surge Barrier) and New Bedford MA (New Bedford  Hurricane Barrier) in the United States.   There is also a range of technologies available today that provide moveable, or  deployable flood barriers, that can rapidly be placed in areas under threat of inundation.

Dykes and  levees have a relatively large footprint in the landscape and are built  to a crest height sufficient to prevent overtopping by flood waters.   The large volume of material used helps to resist the water  pressures associated with deepening depths. The sloped sides  reduce the impact of wave action.   Figure 8-36 provides schematics  for a typical set back dyke profile.              FIGURE 8-36:  Illustration of typical setback dyke design for use in British Columbia (Adapted from GOV/CAN/BC 2003).     46 | P a g e    HISTORIC ACADIAN DYKES   Some of the dykes that will need retro-fitting include historic dykes and levees that  have been part of the Canadian landscape since the earliest days of European  settlement.  Dykes have been used in Canada for hundreds of years, to reclaim low- lying land from coastal areas and riverine flood plains, and to protect communities  that developed on low-lying lands prone to seasonal or storm event flooding.  Many  of the Acadian dyke systems of Atlantic Canada were constructed by early French  settlers and are still in place and working today (Figure 8-37).     In areas of Nova Scotia, mechanical drainage of the land behind the dykes was not  required, because low tide in areas of the Bay of Fundy falls considerably below land  levels.  The traditional mechanism for drainage, the aboiteau, opened to allow  freshwater to drain from the marsh behind the dyke, and closed to prevent sea   water from entering.  In well settled areas of the Bay of Fundy, notably areas such  as the Tantramar Marshlands on the isthmus that connects Nova Scotia and New  Brunswick, major road and rail routes continue to be protected from coastal flooding  by these Acadian dykes.     Some of the dykes in this and other areas are now more than 300 years old and are  finally falling into disrepair, and/or are insufficient to protect the area from flooding  associated with sea-level rise and storm surges. In some areas of the eastern coast,  efforts are being made to breach the historic dykes to allow natural restoration of  the early salt marshes, which by themselves offer the potential to attenuate wave  energy and reduce damage during storm events.                         FIGURE 8-37:  Illustration of the construction methods used for the historic Acadian dykes at Grand Pré,   Nova Scotia, including the mechanics for drainage using an aboiteau (Adapted from: le Paysage de Grand Pré.

Neither historic dykes nor even dykes built in  the last 50 years are likely to have flood crests capable  of withstanding the projected flood water levels.  It is  also important to note that even more modern dykes  (e.g., 1970s) were often designed using fewer criteria  than would be considered the norm for today (Figure  8-38).  In addition to data on historical maximum  water levels, plus an additional height added as  freeboard, modern dyke design criteria include  maximum high tide water levels, relative sea-level  rise (where applicable), historical storm surge data,  local prevailing winds and storm winds direction and  magnitude, fetch, and anticipated wave energy.   Where dykes intended to contain riverine flood water  are being adjusted, factors must also include the  impact of anticipated heightened sea levels during  storm and high tide events.  As sea level rises, the  capacity for riverine water to spill into the sea can be  diminished, especially in low-lying deltas and  estuaries, resulting in larger amounts of freshwater  that will back up into the floodplain.    For many areas currently protected by dykes and  levees, the options to increase the crest height may  be limited.  For each unit of crest elevation, a  disproportionate area of land will be required to  enlarge the footprint for the dyke, to ensure  structural stability and strength) (Figure 8-39).  In  areas where development has been permitted near  the toe of the landward slope of the dyke, costs  escalate where land uses must be changed and/or  properties moved or abandoned, or where  alternative methods for construction are employed.

Groynes are usually built of wood, stone or concrete units piled  perpendicular to the shore or at an oblique angle and extending from the foreshore  to a water depth determined to be sufficient to interrupt wave driven longshore  sediment transport processes.  Groynes are also used to dissipate wave energy,  and/or to reduce the offshore or alongshore transport of sediment (Figure 8-45).   Perhaps more than any other shoreline structure, improper design and placement  of groynes have resulted in unanticipated damage to local coastal conditions.  Other  structures such as piers, and infilled shorelines can also affect shoreline processes if  not well-designed and constructed.    Groynes are generally used to promote the accretion of sand on the up-drift side of  the groyne.  Multiple groynes constructed along a section of shoreline, can be used  to manage shore erosion, especially when coupled with beach nourishment  programs.  Groyne design is varied and complex, and the structures can be built  using a range of locally available and imported materials including (Engineers  Australia 2012):    • quarried rock armour placed to protect a core of smaller rock;    • concrete armour units protecting a rock core;    • sand filled geotextile containment units;    • steel or concrete sheet piles;    • structural concrete in the form of caissons, and   • heavy timbers.    Groyne design is a complex undertaking, requiring considerable knowledge of local  coastal hydrodynamics and geomorphology.  Special care must be taken where  there are valued beach and dune systems, wetlands and riverine deltas, to insure  there are no detrimental effects on local sedimentation and erosion processes.   Where improperly designed and/or placed, groynes can impact the coastline  through:   • reductions in the supply of sand to down-drift areas, resulting in loss of  beach area and/or shoreline erosion; and    • increased conflicts with private and public stakeholders who hold differing  views on the value the groynes bring to the area, especially when the  aesthetics of the landscape and public access to the shore are  compromised.     In some situations, groynes designed and placed to achieve multiple goals can  improve local access to the water for viewing or fishing and can be incorporated into  local longshore pathways,       FIGURE 8-45:  Groynes on the beaches of the Toronto Islands (Image Credit: C. Mercer Clarke).     49 | P a g e    8.4.9 BREAKWATERS, OFFSHORE REEFS, AND BARRIER ISLANDS   Breakwaters are rigid structures constructed generally for reducing the amount of wave energy that reaches the  shore (Figure 8-46).  Natural breakwaters include offshore reefs, sand spits, barrier islands, and barachois beaches.   Constructed breakwaters are usually formed using large rock or preformed concrete units, however in some areas  of Canada, derelict ships have deliberately been sunk on pre-determined locations to provide a basis for marine  habitat and to aid in coastal protection.     Offshore breakwaters, and bulkheads are also intended to reduce the intensity of wave action in inshore waters,  reducing the potential for shoreline and bluff erosion and improving harbour conditions.  Where detached  breakwaters are well designed and placed along shorelines, the interruptions to long-shore drift patterns can  create situations highly supportive of sediment accumulation along the shoreline, reducing erosion and recreating  beaches (Figure 8-467.  This ‘tombolo’ effect promotes sediment accretion between the breakwater and the shore,  where wave energy and longshore drift currents are reduced, improving conditions for the deposition of sands and  sediments.  Natural tombolos occur where nearshore islands become attached to the land by a narrow beach or  spit.  Man-made tombolos are the result of carefully designed and placed breakwaters intended to supplement  sedimentation on the nearby shoreline.            FIGURE 8-47:  Offshore breakwaters used to create beach area along the shoreline at Norfolk VA (Google Earth Maps 2016)  FIGURE 8-46:  Breakwaters used to protect shorelines   and create harbours at Grand Manan and Shediac Beach   NB (Google Earth Maps 2016)     50 | P a g e    8.4.10 HYBRID APPROACHES   There is increasing interest in the potential for  combining approaches to coastal protection such that  proposed works are a hybrid of enhanced natural  features and built structures (Figure 8-48).  As has  been seen in some of the examples already  presented, natural features may benefit from  structural assistance (Figure 8-49).  In some  circumstances, constructed breakwaters can mimic  the performance of naturally occurring formations,  generating benefits such as diminished wave energy - and improved deposition of beach materials (Figure  8-50).  Under other conditions, constructed coastal  defences (e.g., revetments, seawalls) benefit from  the reduction in wave energy reaching the shore  made possible by their association with enhanced  natural features (e.g., seagrass beds, salt marshes).     There is no one perfect combination of engineering  and natural features that will answer the flood  protection measures for all situations, or for all time  (Table 8-5).  Each approach has advantages and  disadvantages, but they do share one common  attribute – when used to abate flooding associated  with sea-level rise, both approaches must be  considered as temporary measures.  While many sea- level rise projections extend into the future as far as  2100, it is important once again to note that seas will  continue to rise past that date, reaching levels that  will be determined by the rate and scope of global  warming the planet experiences.  To this end, all  protection measures will either have to migrate  landward, or be themselves flooded.       FIGURE 8-49:  Restoration of   dunes at Crowbush Cove PE.

INFRASTRUCTURE TYPE STRENGTHS WEAKNESSES   BUILT INFRASTRUCTURE    (gates, dykes, revetments, seawalls,   groynes, breakwaters, etc.)   • Ready availability of significant knowledge and expertise to   design and build these structures   • Decades of experience   • Excellent understanding of how these approaches function,   how they interact with the natural environment, and what   level of protection to expect.   • Immediately ready to withstand flooding upon completion   of construction   • Structures do not easily adapt to changing conditions such as sea-level rise   • Structures weaken over time, and have a determined life expectancy before   replacement   • Often require expert design, high construction costs and regular   maintenance   • Can negatively impact local ecosystems, and natural processes   • Offer what can be a false sense of security against all threat of flooding   • May sustain more damage during storm events than natural systems   • Provide benefits only during storm events, not during good weather   NATURAL INFRASTRUCTURE   (seagrass beds, salt marshes, beaches   and dunes, river bank vegetation, etc.)   • Many co-benefits in addition to flood protection, including   enhanced habitat, water quality improvements, carbon   sequestration, recreational and aesthetic amenities, which   are available all the time   • Restored ecosystems such as salt marshes continuously   improve and become stronger and more resilient   • Can keep pace with sea-level changes   • May be cheaper to construct and to maintain   • Can survive storm events with less damage than built   infrastructure and will (generally) self recover   • Less readily available expertise or experience in construction or restoration    • Need for best practices in planning, design, construction and maintenance   • The range of nearshore protection services provided is not well understood,   quantified or immediately replicable in a different location    • May require lengthy period to establish before shoreline protection benefits   are realized   • Requires substantial land and/or water area for implementation   • Little data on the cost of implementation   • Regulatory approvals may be more difficult to obtain than for established   built infrastructure practices   HYBRID INFRASTRUCTURE   (combinations of built and natural)   • Capitalizes on the best characteristics of built and natural   systems   • Encourages innovation in design for shoreline protection   • Provides some co-benefits in addition to shoreline   protection   • Can provide a higher level of confidence than natural   systems alone   • Can be used in areas where there is not enough space to   implement full natural system approaches   • Little data on performance to date   • Does not provide all the co-benefits of a natural system   • More research is needed   • Growing but still limited expertise and experience   • Will still have some negative impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem   functioning   • Insufficient data on cost to benefit ratios   • Regulatory approvals can be more difficult to obtain than for established   built infrastructure practices        52 | P a g e    8.5 AVOIDING THE PROBLEM   Unlike earlier approaches that advocated ‘do nothing’ or ‘no active intervention’, avoiding the problem of sea-level  rise and overland flooding is not about ignoring anticipated changes or heightened risks.  Avoiding the problem is  a thoughtful, and often long-term planning process for reducing the risks to property and to human well-being of  anticipated higher and/or more frequent flooding.     Avoiding the problem can entail using a range of options over time that may include some or all of the following:    • managed realignment of shorelines,    • planned migration of structures and/or activities;    • zoning and other land development and management instruments,    • setbacks, buffers and easements, and the    • relocation of critical services and assets to maximize public and private benefit and to minimize risks to  property and safety.    How society plans and manages land use and land development now and for the future can enhance community  resilience to changes in the environment if efforts are made to:    • responsibly alter shorelines as an (understood short-term) measure to protect property and uses;    • manage migration by initiating long term planning processes that involve public education on risks and  benefits, on the temporal limitations of protective measures, and on the need to plan now for migration  of property and activities to lower-risk locations; and    • update planning and development instruments (e.g., zoning, setbacks) for land and resource  development to provide for anticipated changes in local conditions.   Projections of future environmental change are modelled expectations of what is to come.  If some uncertainty  still exists in the science on climate change, it is uncertainty over the scope, intensity and timing of anticipated  changes in local weather and regional and national trends in climate.  While much can and must be done to meet  these challenges, it is important to accept, that in some circumstances, society will have to migrate away from the  coming hazards to places of greater stability and safety.  There is little doubt that migration will be disruptive to  communities and to individuals, or that it will be an unpalatable but inevitable option for many.  Migration need  not be promoted as losing the battle, or as a retreat from unassailable threats.  Thoughtful long-term consultation,  planning and design has the potential and the promise to create modern, exciting and highly livable communities,  resilient, transformed and sustainable, and highly capable of meeting the demands of the changing future.          “Informed planning for   development in areas affected   by sea-level rise is critical”  (Batterson and Liverman 2010, p138)   Decisions on restricting new   development and/or relocating   existing structures and activities   will have to reach a balance   between the escalating costs for   protective measures, the   increasing risks to property and   to safety and the values   imbedded in each asset or   activity that is at risk.     53 | P a g e    8.5.1 ALTERING THE SHORELINE   Altering the shoreline from its natural configuration is increasingly referred to as  managed realignment (Figure 8-51).  Shoreline realignment has also been used in  beach-dune complexes where dunes are being eroded.  In this situation, the  eroding shoreline is restructured, and the dunes are relocated inland, maintaining  the cross-shore supply of sediment and creating new longshore patterns for  sediment drift.  In areas where the natural shoreline has been overtaken by hard  armouring, removal of seawalls and revetments allows the coast to return to a  more natural form, albeit some time is required to achieve a degree of stability.     The line of actively maintained defences is moved to a new location, inland of the  original and (preferably) on higher ground.  In the process, new shallow water  habitat is created in the area between the location of the old defences and the  new defences.  On marine coasts, the objective can often be to create new salt  marshes, and in some circumstances, such as the breaching of dykes, to restore  the original marsh.  As noted earlier, marshlands can be effective in reducing wave  energy and in securing sediments otherwise lost to erosion.      Attempts to undertake a managed realignment of the shoreline would require that  the following conditions exist (GOV/CAN/BC 2014; Linham and Nicholls 2010):   • presence of existing shoreline defences, including natural dune  formations;   • availability of (affordable and available) low-lying land at the shore;   • need to improve shoreline defences against flooding;    • commitment to long-term, strategic action requiring maintenance;    • suitability of land to be flooded (e.g., no sites of historic or cultural  significance, economic or ecological importance);   • support from local coastal management and other regulatory authorities;   • support for the creation of nearshore habitats to support local flora and  local and migratory fauna; and   • public awareness of the values of realignment projects.    Managed realignment is itself a form of migration away from the sea.  Land must  be sacrificed to create both the new shoreline defences and the marshlands.   Unless some of this property is used to also create a new, waterfront with  amenities for public use, local controversy can lead to opposition.      FIGURE 8-51:  Approaches to coastal protection that include natural infrastructure, managed   realignment, and hybrid measures (Image Credit: USA/NOAA Available at:   http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2015/20150429-noaa-study-finds-marshes-reefs-  beaches-can-enhance-coastal-resilience.html ).   MANAGED REALIGNMENT is a deliberate process to alter a coastline, and/or   to remove or to breach existing flood defences to allow flooding of low-lying   areas.  It has also been defined as a landward relocation of the land: sea border   from its natural position.   http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2015/20150429-noaa-study-finds-marshes-reefs-beaches-can-enhance-coastal-resilience.html http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2015/20150429-noaa-study-finds-marshes-reefs-beaches-can-enhance-coastal-resilience.html   54 | P a g e    8.5.2 MANAGING MIGRATION   The movement of society and property away from areas of increased risk is not a retreat away from harm  but a migration towards a safer more resilient location.  The use of the terms ‘defend’ and ‘retreat’ in the  adaptation literature has supported the often-traditional human view that the environment is to be  controlled, and if it cannot be controlled, we have somehow lost and must depart the field of battle, broken  and defeated.  Because of the prejudicial context of the current language on adaptation, moving away from  increased threats, especially those posed by rising seas, has generally been considered as the least  preferable option.  In reality, flooding that is the result of intensive precipitation or rising sea level will  continue to be an escalating threat to human settlement and activities that lie in harm’s way.  Reactive  measures to accommodate those risks, or to protect against them, must be considered to be temporary  measures whose effectiveness has a prescribed and deteriorating life expectancy.  Whether  accommodation or protection measures become impractical to implement, or the costs to build or to  maintain too burdensome, the inevitable result will be the same – structures and uses will need to move.   When retreating from a hazard is well planned, it becomes a migration – something humans have been  doing for thousands of years – to a better life.  The key to the transformation from communities at risk to  vibrant, resilient, and sustainable communities is vested in planning processes that work now to better  enable that relatively unknown future.     Managing an effective migration of assets and uses will require a careful examination of the risks and  opportunities as well as the costs and benefits associated with persisting in place or planning for thoughtful  relocation of assets and activities.  Migration processes must be based on the need to (Niven and Bardsley  2013).   • lower or remove risks to lives and to infrastructure;   • protect both valued environmental features and amenities of importance to society;   • limit expectations of costs associated with relocation of structures, services and activities;   • encourage future long-term and equitable use of the (changing) coast; and    • ensure that (to the greatest capacity possible) the sense of place important to so many societies  transfers to the new location.   While migration is, admittedly, a costly option economically, environmentally and culturally, in some  locations it may be the only practical option.  Communities and societies that are ready to embrace that  reality, will plan now for changes to come.  Proactive planning ensures that when risks become too high to  bear, acceptable alternatives are available.  When major decisions are made to relocate essential services  or irreplaceable cultural assets, there are locations that have been designated as potential sites for  migration.  In areas where the lands under threat have already been built upon, communities can alter  allowable land uses to reflect the increases in risk and prepare new sites in safer areas.  In the aftermath of  flood events, acquisition of damaged properties will contribute to planned migration, and provide  acceptable options for often beleaguered land owners.         “Planning shapes the places where   people live and work and the   country we live in. It plays a key role   in supporting the Government’s   wider economic, social and   environmental objectives and for   sustainable communities.” (GOV/UK 2010)   PLANNED MIGRATION GOAL   Armouring of shorelines, development and redevelopment   in areas under threat will be limited.  Renovation and   reconstruction will not be permitted for properties damaged   by flooding and/or weather events.  Eventual relocation of   structures, systems and users to safer locations will be   planned for and implemented as threat levels increase.    Planning will ensure public access to the changing shoreline,   recreation of cultural spaces, and other important attributes   of liveable landscapes.   “We will have to retreat sooner or   later as sea-levels rise - the financial   costs of holding the shoreline in place   … will eventually force our hand.”   (Andrew Cooper, Professor of Coastal Studies, University of   Ulster)     55 | P a g e    Careful planning will improve public understanding of changing vulnerabilities and risk   (Figure 8-52).  The array of complex information necessary for planning for change includes   (Georgetown Climate Center 2011; GOV/AUSTRAL/NSW 2010):   • land tenure and use:  ownership and use (e.g., public or private) of currently and  potentially affected lands will affect the capacity for communities to plan  migration and may result in acrimonious relationships with property owners and  public users, especially when their use is infringed upon – whether or not the  proposed constraints are in the best interests of the individual or of the public.    • critical infrastructure: there will be trade-offs between the economic and  environmental costs of maintaining expensive infrastructure in its current  configuration or phasing out its use at that location over time and planning for  relocation to less hazardous areas.    • cultural landscapes:  the sense of place that so often defines personal and  community identity can be tied to structures or activities located in a place of  deep cultural or historical significance, a situation that does not readily translate  to a new location.     • developed lands:  while protection measures may be a feasible option for the  near future, in reality there will also need to be enforceable limitations on hard  armouring, or other protective measures, and on reconstruction of storm- damaged property.    • developable lands:  land that is considered to have a high potential for future  development, even lands where development permits have already been  granted, will need to be re-examined against existing and mounting threats and  the potential for damage to future development.  land with a high potential for  development, and few risks of damage, should be considered now for relocation  of structures and systems in the future.  advance planning efforts can ensure the  creation of livable, sustainable communities for the future.    • undevelopable lands (e.g., floodplains, beach areas, wetlands, important forests,  eroding shores): Lands that are considered inappropriate for development now  and into the future, could be used to preserve and enhance valued nearshore,  aquatic and marine ecosystems, providing opportunities for the inland migration  of wetlands and beaches, and improving the potential of natural features to  shelter local environments, structures and communities.                FIGURE 8-52:  Planning considerations for coastal land use as flood   control levels (FCL) rise with sea-level rise and more severe weather   (adapted from Kerr Wood Lidal 2011).     56 | P a g e    8.5.3 UPDATING PLANNING INSTRUMENTS   Some communities have chosen to address the changes in environmental conditions through  specially focussed climate adaptation plans, but the real strength in regional and community  planning lies in integrating these efforts into established planning and development instruments  such as county/district plans, town plans, development agreements and enforceable bylaws (Table  8-6).  Processes to review and to alter these legal instruments can be open and collaborative,  engaging support from the community and ensuring that all perspectives have been heard and all  options transparently assessed.     Planning and regulatory instruments are powerful tools that can assist in incorporating  mechanisms to respond to the science and recommendations on anticipated changes in flood  levels, storm surges, and wave and wind damage.  Integration of climate adaptation into existing  planning and management tools also increases the potential for successful implementation and  enforcement.  Planning instruments can also provide incentive for the development of emergency  response and disaster recovery measures, ensuring regular updates to address the effects of  changing conditions on critical elements such as evacuation routes, shelter location safety, and  threats to emergency and health services.    Comprehensive community plans (e.g., official plan, general plan, town plan, master plan) are one  of the most powerful tools for development planning and management.  In general, community  plans are long-term plans, with time frames that span up to 20 years.  In Canada, provincial  regulations require the regular review and update of community plans, sometimes on five-year  intervals.  The processes for plan development and plan review are transparent and include  multiple options for stakeholder and public participation.  Plans are generally implemented  through a range of legally binding instruments that include zoning, bylaws, development permits,  and other special conditions (e.g., stormwater, wastewater).     Zoning is the primary mechanism by which local governments control the kind and scope of  development that takes place in their jurisdiction.  Zoning provides direction for the type of use  permitted (e.g., residential, commercial, industrial, greenspace) and specifies through Bylaws the  associated conditions to govern the construction and operation of that development.  Zoning is  increasingly being used to prevent development in hazardous areas, and to limit the lifespan of  development and occupancy in locations at threat from rising water levels.     Subdivision regulations and controls apply when a developer wants to divide a parcel of land into  one or more separate land ownership units, often for residential development.  Subdivision plans  are required to provide details on roads, water, and sewer infrastructure, to meet minimum lot  size and access requirements, and to address issues related to financial, environmental and other  impacts to the local area.  In areas near water bodies and/or wetlands, subdivision requirements  can include buffers between the toe of built structures and local vegetation or high-water marks  and may also carry additional requirements for on-site septic systems.   RULES FOR PLANNING IN FLOOD PRONE AREAS    • People and development should be located away from areas   vulnerable to current and anticipated hazards    • Shorelines, whether on lakes, rivers or marine coasts should be   protected.  Setbacks should ensure restricted development and use.   • No new construction, and only temporary use should be allowed   within designated flood areas.  Flood area designations should be   assessed every five years.    • Critical infrastructure (e.g., hospitals, emergency, police) should be   sited outside of high-risk areas to ensure continued operation   during severe weather events.    • Water and wastewater treatment plants should be sited outside of   high-risk areas and designed to operate throughout disaster   events.    • Transportation networks should be designed and integrated into a   land use plan to reduce exposure and vulnerability and to ensure   operability during and after severe weather events.     (Beatley 2009)   “MAINSTREAMING adaptation means ensuring that planning and   decision-making take climate change impacts and vulnerability   assessment into account wherever relevant.  It puts in place an   integrated response to a changing climate, assists in ensuring that   opportunities to address vulnerabilities are explored, and also helps   to avoid policies and projects that have an adverse effect on   adaptation because climate change impacts were not considered.    Mainstreaming will not happen overnight, but it is an open-ended   process that can be improved over time.”  (GOV/CAN/BC 2012, p 22)   “…the old legal rules must shift to make   sense in a rapidly changing world”    (Bailey 2010, p319)     57 | P a g e    In addition to zoning, some areas also use Floodplain Guidelines and/or  Regulations to delineate the boundaries of areas prone to flooding, to limit  the kinds of development and use permitted in those areas, and/or to dictate  conditions for construction, occupancy and operation.     In some municipalities, Development Permits are used successfully to  designate acceptable land uses, and/or to enforce site specific guidelines for  development.  As sea levels rise, the option for implementation of Rebuilding  or Renovation Restrictions for structures located within areas now deemed  hazardous, or with the potential to become hazardous, can offer a  compromise for property owners wishing to remain on the site for the near  future.  While occupancy continues to be permitted, it is accepted that  damage to the structures as the result of inundation and/or extreme weather  cannot be repaired.    Cluster Development also offers some opportunities to continue living near  the shore.  Subdivision regulations can allow for development in areas that  are or will be at threat of flooding by reducing the area of each building lot,  combining services and locating roadways to remove some of the risk of  impacts from flooding and wave action.  Where developers own large tracts  of nearshore lands, permits can be issued for development plans that contain  residences on smaller, move favourable areas of the site (e.g., higher lands)  while allowing the remainder of the site to continue as greenspace and to act  as natural flood attenuation areas.     Setbacks or buffers require that all development is situated at a specified  distance from a designated baseline, typically a shoreline or vegetation  feature.  Land within the buffer/setback that is considered to support  important ecological habitats and services is left in its natural state    In all review and readjustment of land planning instruments, care must be  taken to ensure that there is coordination among the policy and regulations  of all levels and sectors of government, to avoid conflicts and to reduce the  opportunities for legal challenges by property owners and/or users.  Care  must also be taken to address the rights of access of the public to the  shorelines they love, when the publicly owned lands upon which those  shorelines once stood are disappearing beneath the water.    Samples of land planning instruments used across Canada and in other  nations have been included in the Additional Reading section at the end of  this chapter.            LAND PLANNING AND MANGEMENT TERMS    (adapted from Curran 2003; GOV/CAN/BC 2013)   BROWNFIELD:  an unused area of former industrial lands that may or not be   contaminated, or that have been remediated.    CLUSTER DEVELOPMENT:  concentration of development on smaller lots on a portion   of a larger site to provide room for green infrastructure.   DENSITY:  amount of residential, commercial or industrial development permitted on a   land area    DEVELOPMENT PERMIT:  a land use regulation that combines objectives and guidelines   with requirements for development that are site specific.  Development permits can be   used to regulate use of a site in ways that protect the natural environment from impact,   and/or that protect development from conditions deemed hazardous.    EASEMENTS, COVENANTS:  a legal agreement in which the landowner grants the use   of some real property rights to another for a specific purpose such as the right to pass   over.  Can also be used to restrict the use of the land for a specific purpose (e.g.,   conservation, flood protection).   FORESHORE TENURE:  the lease or licence of operation of the area of land from the   Crown below the natural boundary (e.g., the highwater mark) to allow for integrated   management (and use) of the foreshore.    LAND ACQUISITION:  local governments can gain ownership of land for the primary   purpose of addressing public safety through purchase or expropriation.  Land can be   acquired for a range of purposes including construction of shoreline protection   measures, setbacks for public safety, prevention of development and/or exclusive public   use.     LAND TRUST:  a legal entity established for the management of land for conservation   or other non-development purposes.   NATURAL BOUNDARY:   the visible highwater mark on any lake, river stream or body   of water, the edge of marshes of dormant channels.  Along marine coasts, it can include   the natural limit of permanent terrestrial vegetation.    SETBACKS, BUFFERS:  a horizontal or vertical distance that buildings or other structures   must be set back from an established boundary, or a designated reference point.     SUBDIVISION REGULATION:  regulatory instrument to protect/restrict property   development in areas vulnerable to coastal hazards, and/or where the natural   environment could be adversely affected by sea-level rise and overland flooding.    TRANSFER OF DEVELOPMENT POTENTIAL:  where land is at risk, the ‘as of right’   potential for development could be transferred to another area or parcel of land not at   risk.      58 | P a g e      TABLE 8-6: Managed migration planning tools (Adapted from Georgetown Climate Center 2011 and GOV/CAN/BC 2012).   TOOL DESCRIPTION APPLICATION TO SLR AND FLOODING   PLANNING TOOLS   COMPREHENSIVE PLANS,   TOWN PLANS   Enunciate local vision and policies and are a long-term planning tool that guides   existing land use and future development. Comprehensive plans establish the basis for   zoning changes, bylaws, ordinances and approvals.   Inclusion of flood risks and anticipated effects of sea-level rise and severe weather provide   direction for current decisions related to land-use, while ensuring that future risks are also   considered.     SUBDIVISION ACTS AND   REGULATIONS   Place restrictions on the kind of property that can be subdivided, govern the minimum   size of lots, require allocations for public open space, control occupation densities, and   encourage concentration of new development in preferred areas.   Concentration of new development in areas at low risk of flooding or wave action.  Dedication   of areas vulnerable to flooding as open space and/or setback or buffer areas.     FLOODPLAIN AND   COASTAL DEVELOPMENT   REGULATIONS   Used to restrict development in areas designated as the 100-year floodplain, and/or to   require new and existing structures to meet requirements to minimize flood damage   and promote safety.   Limits permitted uses in the floodplain to recreational, agricultural, forestry (i.e., exclude   residential, commercial, health uses).  Regulations used to designate expanded boundaries   anticipated for changing conditions, and to impose design and construction restrictions on   structures in those areas (e.g., setbacks, minimum base elevations).    SEA-LEVEL RISE PLANNING   AREAS   A potential tool to deal with areas at risk, requiring periodic reassessment and   adjustment to define and to alter setbacks and restrictions for development.   Used to restrict new development in areas deemed hazardous and to provide for eventual   abandonment and/or relocation of existing structures and activities.  Also used to designate   needed land area for seawall/dyke construction and upgrade.    LOCAL REGULATORY TOOLS   ZONING    Used to designate areas as not suitable for development, or to restrict the kind of   development, the density, and/or the use.  Bylaws dictate the criteria for development   by limiting building footprint and specifying drainage management.   Hazardous area zoning often delineates flood prone areas.  Can also be used to restrict   development in steep slope areas.    BYLAWS  Set infrastructure requirements for buildings and other structures, as well as   specifications for roads, lighting, water and sewage and drainage.     Bylaws can be used to restrict protective structures such as shoreline armouring or to   encourage low impact development, green infrastructure, water management.   WATERFRONT   DEVELOPMENT PLANS   Used to designate land use in nearshore areas for commercial, industrial, and/or   residential development.     Can include setbacks from the shore, limit activities and occupancy, establish expected life   cycles for structures and require planning for removal of assets to safer areas over time.    DEVELOPMENT   AGREEMENTS   A more flexible approach than zoning because they can specify site-specific   requirements not normally included within zoning legislation or bylaws.     Used to apply special case requirements such as protection of the natural environment,   protection of the community from hazards, requirement for low-impact development;   setbacks, buffers or easements.    STORMWATER   MANAGEMENT PLANS  Measures to address stormwater collection, storage and disposal.  Infiltration, slow release and/or reuse of stormwater    SITE PLANNING AND DESIGN TOOLS   SETBACKS, BUFFERS,   EASEMENTS   Rolling easements provide a changing boundary that preserves capacity for shorelines   to move inland.    Rolling easements used to compel owners to remove structures threatened by flooding and   erosion.   CONSERVATION   EASEMENTS   Flexible measure for preservation of land while allowing it to remain in private   ownership.   Public acquisition of easement lands ensures use as natural habitat, floodable areas, and/or   migration corridors.    DESIGN GUIDELINES AND   BUILDING CODES  Specify what can be built and how it must be built (and maintained).  Require additional measures for wet or dry flood protection, foundation strengthening,    RENOVATION   RESTRICTIONS  Limits the scope of renovation and/or rebuilding permitted. Used to prevent property owners from continuing occupancy in hazardous locations.   SHORELINE ALTERATION   PERMITS   Used to regulate the kind and scope of hard and soft armouring of marine and   freshwater shorelines.   Permitting processes can dictate design and construction methods, and limit armouring in   areas where erosion and/or flooding are deemed to be continuing and escalating hazards.        59 | P a g e    8.5.4 SETBACKS AND BUFFERS   Setbacks (also buffers) are land management and building restriction tools that  prevent development and/or human use in certain designated areas (Figure 8- 53).  The terms setback and buffer have often been used interchangeably.  In  some areas they refer to two different aspects of low or no development zones:  setbacks being the distance from a benchmark to a structure (i.e., building  setbacks from property lines); buffers being designated spaces with restricted  development and/or use.  In coastal areas and along the shores of wetlands, rivers  and lakes, setbacks and buffers are used in conjunction with other land use  restrictions to (Simpson et al. 2012):    • protect human safety and well-being;   • reduce damage to nearshore property during extreme weather or as a  result of changing water levels attributed to sea-level rise;   • protect biodiversity and sustain ecosystem services;   • protect significant cultural landscapes;    • protect important nearshore features (e.g., beaches and dunes, eroding  cliffs, headlands; estuaries, wetlands);   • protect and/or enhance quality views and vistas;    • provide a buffer between marine and freshwater systems and coastal  development, to allow shorelines to evolve, to expand or contract  naturally, and/or to migrate inland;   • provide resources in support of natural processes such as erosion and  sedimentation and prevent interference by hard armouring of  shorelines;    • allow for the continuance of historic reserves and traditional public  access to the shore;    • improve privacy for shoreline residents and users; and    • increase public ownership of the shore as well as participation in  adaptation and restoration initiatives.    Setbacks and buffers can be employed by all levels of government and are  generally enacted as a development policy or regulation, or as a zoning ordinance  or bylaw.  If well-designed and implemented, setbacks and buffers are a relatively  low-cost to no-cost option for protecting shorelines and environments from  human impacts, while advancing the benefits provided by natural features (i.e.,  attenuating impacts of higher water levels and wave energy, sequestering  carbon).  Setbacks and buffers are used in some Provinces and local jurisdictions  to protect watercourses from development, including agriculture and industrial  development.  Setbacks and buffers can also be used to ensure there is sufficient  area inland of a shoreline to allow for gradual migration of nearshore features  such as beaches, dunes, wetlands and coastal forests.      FIGURE 8-53:  Sample buffer sizes for multiple goals (adapted from Schreier 2014).   SETBACK:  a land management tool that requires development to be ‘set back’ a   prescribed distance from a designated feature such as the high water high tide mark,   the edge of a river bank, the seaward line of vegetation, or the crest of a dune   formation.  Inside the area prescribed by the setback, development can be banned or   restricted according to an established set of criteria.  Human use can also be limited   by category, or time of the year. (adapted from Simpson et al. 2012)   BUFFER:  a designated area of land in which construction and use is prohibited so as   to protect the existing natural environment and to ‘buffer’ the effects of human   society on valued adjacent ecosystems (e.g., beaches and dunes, wetlands, streams,   forests).   No setback or buffer can   ensure safety from rising   water or storm damage,   especially in today’s   changing world.       60 | P a g e    Setbacks often use benchmarks to define their boundaries and/or the operating limits of restrictions for  development or use.  In marine coastal areas, setbacks generally fall into two broad categories (Figure 8-54):    • Vertical setbacks are intended to protect coastal infrastructure from flooding resulting from rising seas  and higher storm surges and wave action.  Vertical setbacks set a minimum height above an established  sea level (e.g., higher high water plus projected storm surge) for the occupied floors of structures.     • Horizontal setbacks also protect coastal infrastructure but may be used to protect valued ecological  and/or cultural assets, to ensure the rights of the Crown (e.g. access to the foreshore in harbours) or to  ensure public rights of access.  Horizontal setbacks can be more complicated as they are often based on  a prescribed horizontal distance from a seaward benchmark that is used to define the area at greatest  risk from coastal hazards (e.g. wave action, erosion, storm surges, and sea-level rise) and/or human  development and use.     In many areas of the Canadian coast, the benchmarks established for coastal setbacks and coastal buffers are now  moving, as sea levels rise, and storms become more intense.  Vertical and horizontal setbacks established today  cannot be depended upon to continue to protect all property and all activities as environmental conditions worsen  at the shore.  Property owners and coastal decision-makers must continually update their understanding of  changing conditions to ensure that setbacks and buffers remain adequate to meet local challenges.    In the past vertical setbacks relied on benchmarks such as the historic records for local highest high water, and for  the highest storm surges (e.g., 100-year storms) that had been recorded.  As seas rise, and land subsides in some  areas, vertical benchmarks may no longer provide long term security against flood and storm damage.  Horizontal  setbacks, and marine coastal and watercourse buffers, also use benchmarks (e.g., highest high water, top of beach,  top of dune, edge of bank, edge of vegetation), all of which are now likely to be changing, even year to year.  In  some situations, depending on the objective, setbacks and buffers may use a combination of factors to designate  benchmarks.         FIGURE 8-54:  Vertical and horizontal setbacks on a marine coast (Image Credit: C. Mercer Clarke)   Coastlines are ever changing, shaped   by wind, waves, tides and changing   sea levels.  The rules for property   development and maintenance are   designed to protect both the   environment and the property owner.     61 | P a g e    Vertical and horizontal benchmarks can be used individually or in  combination, resulting in a further delineation of setbacks described  as follows (Figure 8-55):   1. A vertical setback based on a calculated minimum elevation  above a permanently fixed sea-level benchmark (e.g. a fixed  tidal benchmark, a surveyed point on the shore); or as    2. A rolling vertical setback based on a calculated minimum  elevation above a sea-level benchmark whose position in the  landscape may change over time.   3. A horizontal setback or buffer based on a specified distance  landward of a permanently fixed benchmark (e.g. a fixed tidal  benchmark, a surveyed point on the shore); or as   4. A rolling horizontal setback or buffer based on a specified  distance landward of a coastal reference feature (e.g. seaward  limit of vegetation, high water high tide, dune crest, shoreline),  whose position in the landscape may change over time; or as   5. A horizontal setback or buffer based on a calculated distance  (which uses dynamic, natural phenomenon) landward of a  permanently fixed benchmark (e.g. a fixed tidal benchmark, a  surveyed point on the shore); or as   6. A rolling horizontal setback or buffer based on a calculated  distance (which uses dynamic, natural phenomenon) landward  of a coastal reference feature (e.g. seaward limit of vegetation,  high water high tide, dune crest, river bank, shoreline), whose  position in the landscape may change over time.   Setbacks and buffers of any kind will be most effective when they  are used as one of a mix of development planning and coastal  management tools, and where the rules for application and  enforcement have been carefully defined and agreed upon across  all appropriate levels of government (Figure 8-56).   Administration  of setbacks and buffers, including the limitations under which  exceptions may be considered, must work from established  descriptions of prohibited and permitted work or activities, the  conditions under which new development or alteration to existing  structures may take place, and the restrictions on removal or  alteration of existing vegetation and/or coastal features (Simpson et  al., 2012).

FIGURE 8-56:  In Prince Edward Island, where the coastline can be threatened by erosion, development in   areas that fall outside a municipality is overseen by the Province.  Construction of new structures is governed   both by a required Buffer established at the edge of the property to protect adjacent beaches, dunes,   watercourses and wetlands, and by a Building Setback, which determines how close to the property line the   foundation for a structure can be located.

Easements can be attached to  property deeds or enacted through special agreements.  Property easements generally bind owners whether to  some defined restriction in their use or development of their property (e.g., conservation easement) or provide a  designated other with rights of access across their property (e.g., power and telecommunications distribution,  shoreline access).     As sea levels rise and shorelines erode, traditional pubic access and use of the shore between high water and low  water is also being eroded, and important coastal features such as beaches, dunes and wetlands are either caught  in the squeeze between new mean water levels and development or have limited opportunities to continue to  migrate inland as shorelines change.   A rolling easement is a legal instrument established to ensure that as water levels rise, and shorelines migrate,  shoreline vegetation (e.g., salt marshes, wetlands) could also migrate and still be protected from development  pressures (Figure 8-57).  Benchmarks that describe the boundaries of the easement are tied to an attribute of the  shoreline that is known to be moving (e.g., highest high-water mark, mean sea level, top of beach, edge of dunes,  edge of wetland).  As these features change the area included within the easement also changes, generally moving  further inland.    While gaining increasing attention in recent times, rolling easements are not a new tool for land management,  having already been used in Texas (1944), South Carolina (1988) and more recently in California 2009 (Bailey 2010).   A rolling easement essentially returns ownership and management of land to the Crown, protecting public rights  of access, and bringing the acquired property under potentially new restrictions for construction, renovation or  even repair.  Once an existing property falls within the easement, the rights of the owners and the value of their  asset change significantly.  Over time, easement restrictions can keep property owners from constructing shoreline  defence measures, adding to existing structures, or repairing damage from storms, and may eventually require  their homes or other structures to be demolished or removed from the site.  Generally rolling easements do not  prevent private use of the property until hazards render occupation or use unsafe.     Even where they are not referred to as rolling easements, many setbacks and buffers whose boundaries move with  changing conditions (i.e. as the benchmark locations change) may perform similar functions.  However, unless the  setback or buffer is clearly described as intending to manage a migration of the shoreline, property owners may  have heightened expectations for compensation from governments as their land and their activities are subsumed  within the setback/buffer.  Where coastal setbacks are rolling easements, the community intent to pursue  migration instead of shoreline protection becomes a more viable option for planning and management.       THIS LAND IS YOUR LAND, THIS LAND IS MY   LAND   In much of Canada, waterfront property owners   hold title to land above the normal high-water   mark, a benchmark that has been somewhat stable   over the centuries, unless the land in question is   subject to vertical movement (subsidence) or   erosion.  The Crown in Canada generally owns land   between the normal high-water mark and the   normal low water mark, which is why we have   public access to beaches during periods of ebbing   tide.  There can be some exceptions (e.g., water lot   rights) to these basic assumptions.  In areas of the   country where water levels are falling (i.e., some of   the Great Lakes shorelines), questions are arising as   to who now holds title to the land that is emerging.    In areas of the country where shorelines are being   eroded and mean water levels are rising, property   owners are losing significant proportions of the   land that historically formed part of their property.    When rolling easements are keyed to those   changes in shoreline features, conflicts can arise   over the (evolving) rights of property owners,   especially where land owners seek compensation   for land already lost and/or included into a rolling   easement.   ROLLING EASEMENT: a legal instrument that   allows publicly owned land, and/or land use and   development restrictions, to migrate inland as sea   levels rise, shorelines erode and beaches and   wetlands retreat.  Rolling easements, like coastal   setbacks, are measured against a coastal   benchmark (e.g., highest high water, dune crest or   edge of vegetation).  Because these benchmarks   are expected to move dynamically with the physical   changes in coastal geomorphology, the easement   is said to “roll”.       63 | P a g e                             FIGURE 8-57:  When governments implement rolling easements,   existing structures and uses may be located in close proximity to   the initial easement boundaries.  Rolling easements clearly present   the government’s intention to move those boundaries as the line   of shore changes.  Easements require property owners to   recognize that their property rights may be affected, and that   eventually will be subsumed within the easement.  In the case   depicted, no repairs are permitted for structural damage due to   environmental impacts.  In some situations, repairs of any kind   may be banned.  Structures deteriorate, and when it is determined   they are no longer safe, or that there are threats to human safety   and well-being, authorities may revoke occupancy permits or   permits for other uses (Image Credit: C.
