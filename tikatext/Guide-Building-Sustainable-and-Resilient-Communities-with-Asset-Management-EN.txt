The services they deliver depend on physical infrastructure   assets like water treatment plants, wastewater retention ponds,   roads, buses, buildings and emergency vehicles. Natural assets   also support municipal service delivery and in some cases are   essential. For example, wetlands can support food control   and fltration, while aquifers can provide safe drinking water to   some communities, with minimal treatment requirements.   In Canada, local governments are the stewards of about   60 per cent of all public infrastructure assets. These assets   are the foundation that enables our communities to thrive.   However, our local governments face some signifcant social,   economic and environmental challenges that will affect their   ability to manage their assets and deliver services sustainably   over the long term.   The way local governments invest in infrastructure assets,   including natural assets, will have a signifcant impact on   whether our communities move toward becoming sustainable   and resilient.   1  | Building Sustainable and Resilient Communities with Asset Management                                                                                                                       Sustainability and resilien e defned   What is a sustainable community?   A sustainable community is one that meets the needs   of the present without compromising the needs of   future generations (source: Environment and Climate   Change Canada). This means making sure we are   making the right decisions today to have a positive   effect in the long term. Local governments need to   ensure that the services they provide support a good   social foundation for all citizens, while ensuring that   collectively we don’t put too much pressure on the   Earth’s life-supporting systems — such as clean water   and air, a stable climate, fertile soils and a protective   ozone layer. For example, if local governments need   to supply more water, they’ll have to fnd a way to   do it without depleting the groundwater supply to   dangerously low levels or using treatment methods   that produce more air pollution.   What is a resilient community?   Community resilience is the capacity to survive and   adapt to chronic stresses and acute shocks, like   population growth or decline, aging populations,   infuxes of new immigrants, economic swings, or   climate change impacts like severe storms, fooding or   melting permafrost. It requires a holistic understanding   of the systems within a community and their   interdependencies and risks. Local governments can   use asset management to become resilient by moving   from a reactive approach that deals with stresses as   they arise, to a more proactive one that anticipates   and considers these stresses during planning.   Asset management enables local go ernments to:   ü Be more organized and coordinated to    implement actions   ü Be bett er prepared to deal with future challenges,   both foreseen and unexpected   ü Be bett er able to engage with and serve their   citizens in both good times and bad   Why should a muni ipal sustainability   hampion  are about asset management?

However, some local governments are now beginning   to recognize the potential of asset management to   achieve more ambitious goals around sustainability   and resilience. These innovators are starting to bring   a more holistic analysis to asset management that   considers long-term socio-cultural and environmental   objectives as well as the fnancial lens.                                                                                               Our  urrent infrastru ture  hallenges  While about one-third of our local assets are aging   or are in poor condition and require signifcant   reinvestment decisions (source: Canadian Infrastructure   Report Card,  016), local governments in Canada are   facing many other pressures, including:   • Managing rapid growth in cities or declining   populations in some rural communities, which places   additional demands on existing assets or local   government resources.   • Navigating rapidly changing service needs resulting   from demographic changes like an aging   population or increased immigration.   • Deciding whether to adopt a vast array of   new technologies being offered to support   service delivery.   • Planning for and fnancing infrastructure that needs   to be built — or rebuilt differently, or located in new   places to accommodate changing health, safety and   environmental standards and be more resilient to   climate impacts.   • Finding ways to manage, protect and value natural   assets and the ecosystem services they   provide, so they can support sustainable, resilient   service delivery in conjunction with traditional,   grey infrastructure.   These challenges require a coordinated, holistic   approach that allows local governments to balance   both short- and long-term service delivery priorities   with public spending that manages costs and risks.   Asset management: An important part of the solution   Local governments have been making decisions   about infrastructure investments for as long as   we have had communities. What’s new with the   introduction of asset management is the approach   used to make these decisions.   Asset management (AM) is an integrated approach,   involving all municipal departments, to choosing   and managing existing and new assets. The goal   is to maximize benefts, reduce risks and provide   satisfactory levels of service to the community in a   sustainable manner.   At the most basic level, good asset management   requires local governments to have accurate data and   knowledge about the value of the assets they already   own, the condition they are in, and the ongoing cost   of operating, maintaining, rehabilitating and eventually   decommissioning them. As local governments plan for   the future, they also need to plan for the new assets   that will be needed to support service delivery over   the longer term. This type of analysis is called life cycle   management. It allows local governments to understand   the full costs of owning and managing assets over their   full life. With this understanding, local governments can   begin to develop medium- or long-term fnancial plans   to ensure that they can meet service delivery needs well   into the future.   3  | Building Sustainable and Resilient Communities with Asset Management                                                                                     -  Be oming more sustainable and resilient  through asset management  Sustainability becomes an embedded value in a local   government when it is integrated across all aspects of   decision-making, and when there is a commitment to   evaluate alternatives with a long-term perspective that   aims to beneft both current and future citizens.   Asset management principles and practices are strongly   aligned with sustainability concepts. Joining or aligning   a municipality’s asset management practices with its   sustainability initiatives or program embeds sustainability   values within local government and helps to improve the   effciency and effectiveness of service delivery.   Sustainable planning integration   for municipalities   PLANET   PROSPERITY   PEOPLE   MUNICIPALITY   Strategic plan   Sustainability policy  (incl. climate change)   Asset & growth management   Financial planning  budget / capital plans   Day-to-day  operations   SMC Sustainability Makes Cents Consulting   The diagram illustrates how vertical integration of   decision-making can help ensure all activities associated   with service delivery are aligned with municipal   values and goals, where fnancial decisions about the   tactical or operational level are connected to decisions   about assets and growth management, and those are   connected to strategic planning and sustainability   policy. Decisions about infrastructure can support   and reinforce long-term community visions and goals.   This is especially true when the local government has   a sustainability policy that brings holistic thinking   to long-term investment planning. The Township of   Langley, BC, is a leader in this area. It has linked its asset   management policy with its sustainability framework.   Of course, local governments don’t operate in a   vacuum, and all decisions need to be made with due   consideration of external factors that lie outside their   jurisdiction. In other words, local governments need to   consider how their decisions will more broadly infuence   and be infuenced by conditions imposed by nature, the   economy and society (Planet, Prosperity and People in   the diagram) so that everyone can enjoy a high quality   of life now and in the future.   To take a fully integrated approach, it is important   to remember that service delivery requires some   aspect of participation by almost all local government   staff and the functional departments they work in.   Good asset management practices enable horizontal   collaboration across the organization so staff can   collectively seek to achieve cost effectiveness by   balancing cost, risk and service needs. This can help   to embed sustainability concepts and goals in all   departments and functions in a consistent way. Some   local governments, like the City of Windsor, Ontario,   have already found signifcant beneft from including   their sustainability coordinator within their asset   management steering committee.   “Asset Management pro ides an  opportunity for sustainability  targets to be embedded in  corporate decision-making. This  integration eliminates the common  reality of sustainability staff ha ing  to lobby for specifc actions on  an ad hoc basis. For example,  adopting a city wide requirement  to include energy and carbon  costs as part of operating costs  enables climate considerations  to be embedded in the decision- making process to support broader  corporate climate goals.”   Karina Ri hters, Supervisor,   Environmental Sustainability and Climate   Change, City of Windsor, Ontario   Building Sustainable and Resilient Communities with Asset Management  | 4                                                                                                                       When  an sustainable pra ti es be built into asset  management planning?  Sustainable practices can be built into all stages of decision-making about services and infrastructure, from the planning   stage right through to operating, maintaining, rehabilitating and decommissioning assets. Here are a few examples:  1       At the planning stage  Life  y le  osting: When planning and budgeting,   local governments should include the costs to   operate, maintain, renew, and dispose of or repurpose   infrastructure over the full life of the assets. Life cycle   analysis should seek to minimize the overall cost of   service delivery and may defer or eliminate the need   for additional grey infrastructure by considering   how service delivery can be supported with   complementary solutions. For example, measures   to support conservation, like demand management   for water, will lower the cost of delivering those   services while treading more lightly on natural   resources. Another example is utilizing or leveraging   natural assets to provide services like rainwater and   stormwater management.   Triple bottom line (TBL) assessment: This goes one step   further than life cycle costing by integrating socio-cultural,   economic and environmental considerations when   evaluating service delivery options. It recognizes that a   holistic and balanced assessment is required to achieve   the best long-term outcome. With TBL assessment,   considerations around goals like climate change, social   equity and effciency, may be brought formally into the   analysis and support decisions. Sustainable solutions are a   desired outcome of triple bottom line assessment.   In 2017, Kings County, No a  Scotia, adopted a prioritization  framework for road re-surfacing  based on a triple bottom line  assessment.  The framework has  brought greater transparency to  council decisions regarding roads  eligible under a cost-sharing  program with the pro ince, and is  expected to impro e effciency.   Engaging the  ommunity on servi e delivery:    Local governments can work with stakeholders in   the community to support them in understanding   the full cost of services and the implications of   asset management options. Community feedback   is essential when evaluating and making decisions   about infrastructure investments to ensure they align   with the community’s goals, willingness to pay, risk   tolerance and service needs. Embedding sustainability   themes and values in engagement processes can also   help community members understand and respond   sustainably in their own actions.   Land use and development: Asset management brings   infrastructure service delivery much closer together   with land use planning and development policies.   Local governments can be proactive in shaping land   use, development charges and zoning such that   they support communities in their journey toward   sustainability and resilience. Here are two examples:   Compact, mixed-use de elopment is   generally less costly to ser ice o er the long   term and can bring multiple other social   and economic benefts to the community,   including housing affordability, impro ed   public health (because it enables acti e   transportation options and transit), reduced   greenhouse gas emissions, and  ibrant and   prosperous downtowns or main streets.   Local go ernments can integrate food   protection, landslide protection and wildfre   protection into land use decisions by   requiring setbacks from water bodies, steep   slopes and forest stands, and by pro iding   guidance on  egetation management.   5  | Building Sustainable and Resilient Communities with Asset Management                                                                                             2       At the operational stage  Pro urement: Local governments can fnd ways to favour   the procurement and selection of assets and services   that achieve multiple social, environmental and economic   benefts. For example, green buildings and clean feets can   support local governments in meeting greenhouse gas   emissions reduction goals while saving operational costs   over the long run. Another example is the acquisition of   natural areas such as wetlands or forests. Adding green   infrastructure and natural assets to the mix has the   potential to support more resilient service delivery.   Resour e use: Local governments can seek out the most   effcient operational processes — those that reduce costs   as well as social and environmental impact. For example,   processes that support recycling, minimize waste, or   conserve energy and water are win-win solutions for the   community that help achieve lower costs with a lighter   environmental footprint. These efforts are a valuable   way for local governments to connect with citizens on a   common goal for which everyone has a role to play.  3       At the maintenance stage  Adhering to a maintenan e s hedule: When local  in the case of the north, melting permafrost.

They may seek   opportunities to salvage or recycle materials, re-purpose   them into something new that’s better aligned with   current and future service needs, or decide the asset   is no longer affordable or needed. With a lens on   sustainability and resilience, local governments need to   be tuned into their community’s long-term needs and   resources in order to make a well-informed decision.
