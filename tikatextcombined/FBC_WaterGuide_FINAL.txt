The guide was launched and distributed through a series  of regional workshops throughout BC, with funding contributions  from the Fraser Salmon and Watersheds Program, Environment  Canada and the Real Estate Foundation of BC.  The project is part of the wider initiative, the BC Regional  Adaptation Collaborative (RAC) to help communities,  governments and other organizations adapt to climate change.  The RAC Program < adaptation.nrcan.gc.ca > enables  Canadians to be better prepared to adapt to changes in the  climate by providing them with adaptation knowledge, tools,  networks and other resources. The Program recognizes that  making adaptation-focused decisions now will help ensure that  our economy, communities and natural resources sectors are  better prepared for climate change impacts in the future.  Fraser Basin Council staff Sheila Creighton and Steve Litke led  the development of the guide. The Council is very appreciative of  the wide range of input, advice, guidance and support that was  offered through the project Advisory Committee.  We would like to extend sincere thanks to all members of the  Advisory Committee, who provided comment and input throughout  the development of the Guide, helping to strengthen its relevance  and usefulness. (see list of advisors on inside back cover).  The guide was informed by a review of relevant literature  including reports, guides, and other print and web-based  publications. In addition, interviews were conducted with local  government staff and other individuals involved in water or  watershed planning. This helped to ground the Guide in the  issues, priorities, experiences, circumstances and needs within  communities across BC. In some cases, special advisors  were engaged on a specific basis to bring their expertise on  issues such as climate change adaptation and First Nations  perspectives.

We depend on it, we value it, and with growing  awareness of the potential impacts of population  growth, climate change and other pressures on our  water resources and watersheds, we must plan in  order to effectively manage and steward our water  resources long into the future.   Water enables the ecosystems, cultures and communities of  British Columbia to survive, thrive and flourish. The future of  species, ecosystems, communities, regions, provinces and future  generations will undoubtedly be influenced, in large part, by how we  manage this precious resource.   This guide has been developed for local governments, First Nations,  and other government agencies, stewardship organizations, water  use sectors and community stakeholders. The purpose of the guide  is to help these organizations and individuals:   ▪Understand the value of water and watershed planning;   ▪Navigate through the web of current and emerging water issues;   ▪  Understand the range of planning options that are available  in BC; and,  ▪  Build capacity to develop and implement plans that will   strengthen watershed health and community sustainability.  The guide:   ▪  Provides an overview of a variety of water and watershed planning  processes that are available to communities in bc  ▪  Helps communities understand how to integrate climate change  considerations within water and watershed planning;  ▪  Shares knowledge, experiences and lessons learned from the  literature and from practitioners that have undertaken water and  watershed planning; and,  ▪  Connects community planners and other practitioners with a wide  range of available tools and information resources.  1. About this Guide  2    Lastly, this section includes general comments about   how climate change information might influence water and  watershed planning processes, resulting in plans that help  communities address the impacts of climate change.  Section 4 provides information about the roles and   responsibilities of different agencies and organizations in   water planning, management and governance.   These include:   ▪ Provincial Government  ▪ Federal Government  ▪ First Nations Government  ▪ Local Government  ▪ Other Organizations  In addition to roles and responsibilities, Section 4 includes some  additional information regarding Living Water Smart: BC’s Water  Plan and modernization of the Water Act.   Sections 5, 6 and 7 provide information about a variety of  specific approaches to water and watershed planning. These  sections provide an introduction and overview of each of the  different approaches to water and watershed planning, including  a general description, an overview of the key elements and  steps, as well as the characteristics, benefits and applications  of each planning process. The planning processes have been  grouped into the following three themes:  Section 5: Managing Water Supply & Demand 1. Water Conservation Plans  2. Drought Management Plans  3. Water Use Plans  4. Water Allocation Plans  Section 6: Protecting Drinking Water Quality 1. Well / Aquifer Protection Plans  2. Source Water Assessments and Assessment Response Plans  3. Drinking Water Protection Plans  Section 7: Integrating Water, Land & Watersheds  1. Water Management Plans (Water Act, Part 4)  2. Watershed Management Plans  3. Rainwater and Stormwater Management Plans  Section 8 provides a synthesis of several relevant issues to  consider in relation to water and watershed planning. Several  common themes emerged from the literature that was reviewed  in the preparation of this guide, from project advisors, from  interviews with communities and from water and watershed  planning case studies. These broad themes are shared to help  communities build a deeper understanding about the dynamics   of watershed planning. These themes include:  1. Rethinking Watersheds and Planning  2. Community Collaboration and Engagement   3. Regional Approaches  4. Resourcing Water and Watershed Initiatives   5. Data, Information and Knowledge Resources  Section 9 of the guide includes several Tools and Resources to  provide additional sources of information to support individuals and  organizations on their path through water and watershed planning.  Find the web version of this guide at www.rethinkingwater.ca. The  web version includes more details on climate change, lessons  learned and tools and resources.   Communities and ecosystems in BC are  experiencing unprecedented changes at many  different scales related to population growth,  settlement patterns, use of natural resources,  release of waste products into the environment,  and a changing climate. From these changes,  flow many impacts, including impacts to water  resources, watershed health, and community  health and sustainability.  Communities rely on water and watersheds for  several immeasurable values including:   ▪  A safe, secure, and adequate supply of water   for domestic, agricultural, commercial, industrial,   recreational and tourism uses;   ▪  A receiving environment for wastewater  discharges;   ▪ Provision of fish, wildlife, habitat and biodiversity;  ▪  Provision of ecosystems services including  moderation of flooding, erosion and   sedimentation processes;   ▪  A host of other social, cultural, economic and  spiritual values.  Planning plays a critical role in how communities   define their vision of the future and their path to  achieve that vision. Planning can be reactive or  responsive, helping to make course corrections  in response to existing issues and challenges. It  can also be proactive in anticipating emerging  issues on the horizon and helping communities  to prepare for and manage those issues. When  it comes to communities and watersheds, there  may be as many different approaches to planning,  as there are communities.   However, there are many common principles,  practices and desired outcomes across the  spectrum of different planning processes used in  BC and beyond. These are discussed in further  detail in the sections that follow.   Section 2 of this guide provides an overview of  planning for water and watersheds. The rationale  for and benefits of water and watershed planning  are described, and examples of the desired  outcomes of planning are identified. Overall  guidelines for designing a planning process are  described as well as some general challenges and  opportunities associated with watershed planning  processes. Ten different planning processes are  profiled. These are described in more detail in  later sections of the guide (5, 6, 7). See section  8 for a more detailed discussion about several  concepts that are relevant to planning for water  and watersheds, including integrated watershed  planning, water centric planning, design with  nature and the soft path approach.  Section 3 provides general information about  the impacts of climate change on water and  watersheds in BC. Some basic information  about how to identify local and regional climate  vulnerabilities, risks and risk management  strategies, and how to integrate climate change  into these strategiesis also provided.   3    2. Planning   for Water &   Watersheds  “A new relationship between people and water  needs to be established to ensure that there  will be water supplies for human use, thriving  ecosystems and a healthy economy… both now  and in the future.”   Every living organism, ecosystem and community requires water  for life, health and functioning. The water cycle also influences  the availability of many natural resources for communities and the  exposure of those communities to water-related hazards. Biodiversity,  ecosystem functioning and most sectors of the economy are highly  dependant on water resources and watershed health.  A watershed refers to a region or area of land that drains into a  stream, river system or other body of water. Watersheds capture  precipitation, filter and store water, and influence the timing and  volume of water flows. They are integrated systems, with actions in  one part of a watershed often impacting other parts of the watershed;  therefore, the watershed is an important unit for planning and  managing water. Watershed planning and management seeks to  ensure the wise and effective use of water and land resources, and in  particular, the quantity, quality and timing of water flows.   Communities rely on water and watersheds for a safe, secure and  adequate supply of water for many uses; a receiving environment  for wastewater discharges; provision of fish, wildlife, habitat and  biodiversity; moderation of flooding, erosion and sedimentation  processes; and a host of other social, cultural, economic and  spiritual values. Communities and watersheds are experiencing  unprecedented changes at many different scales related to  population growth, settlement patterns, use of natural resources,  release of waste products into the environment and a changing  climate. These changes can lead to impacts on water resources,  watershed health and community sustainability.  Water and watershed planning is about defining and achieving a  desired future vision for water resources and watersheds. Planning  plays a critical role in how communities define their vision of the  future and their path to achieve this vision.     –Cowichan Basin Water Management Plan, 2007 1  4    2.1 the VAlue Of PlAnninG  Through water-related planning processes, decision makers and the broader  community will be better able to understand current and future pressures on water  quantity and quality. They will be better able to manage in the face of those pressures.  For example, population growth projections can inform the potential for growth in water  use and demand relative to available supply. Similarly, future climate scenarios can help  users understand if future water supplies might decrease. By exploring future climate,  population, and development scenarios, planners can identify when water use might  be projected to exceed supply and can help make the case for water conservation  and other strategies to contain demand within supply limits. There can also be public  education benefits associated with planning processes, which can lead to public  support in implementing plans and any associated strategies.  The following section will explain what water and watershed planning is, why it is  important, when it is needed and the range of options available in BC. Sections 5, 6  and 7 then describe in more detail the characteristics and requirements associated  with different planning options.   A community vision for a sustainable watershed commonly includes one or more of  the following desired outcomes:   ▪  Managing water uses and rates of consumption within available water supplies  seasonally, annually and over the long-term    ▪  Developing and managing water supplies in ways that do not compromise the health  and biodiversity of fish, wildlife, ecosystems and watersheds   ▪  Managing the allocation of water in ways that support a variety of high-value water  uses, including human consumptive and non-consumptive uses as well as instream,  environmental uses    ▪ Supporting a wide variety of economic development activities   ▪  Managing wastewater discharges within the capacity of receiving waters to absorb  and assimilate those wastes   ▪  Supporting renewable energy sources while minimizing impacts on the environment  ▪  Managing human development patterns in ways that stabilize rather than destabilize  the hydrologic cycle   ▪  Managing development in ways that reduce rather than increase the vulnerability of  communities to flooding and erosion   ▪  Maintaining and strengthening community resiliency and preparedness for change,  including changes in climate  Planning can be reactive and responsive to longstanding issues and challenges. Planning  can also be proactive in anticipating challenges that may be emerging on the horizon.  A significant new challenge for water and watershed planning is how to deal with  climate change. Changes in temperature, precipitation and extreme weather events  have already influenced hydrology, and subsequent drought, and flooding and  erosion effects. These in turn contribute to a variety of impacts on communities  and ecosystems. Scientists project that more changes will come. Identifying,  understanding and preparing for these changes (sometimes referred to as climate  change ‘adaptation’) should become an important component, or a relevant lens to  apply, within water and watershed planning processes.  In sections 5, 6 and 7 of this guide the following approaches to planning for water  and watersheds are profiled:   ▪ Water Conservation Plans  ▪ Drought Management Plans  ▪ Water Use Plans  ▪ Water Allocation Plans  ▪ Well/Aquifer Protection Plans  ▪ Drinking Water/Source Protection Plans  ▪ Assessment Response Plans  ▪ Water Management Plans (Water Act, Part 4)  ▪ Watershed Management Plans  ▪  Liquid Waste/Integrated Stormwater   Management Plans  The suitability of these plans for a community,  region or watershed will vary significantly depending  on the nature and scope of the issues that need to  be addressed. For example, the following are some  key considerations:   ▪ Water quantity or quality?  ▪ Surface or groundwater?  ▪ Drinking water or instream water?  ▪  Water use, wastewater discharge, and/or use?  2.2 An intROduCtiOn tO PlAnninG  Simply put, planning attempts to logically solve a  specific problem or issue and identify steps that can  be taken to reach desired future outcomes. Planning  can be initiated either through voluntary means or  by regulation. According to the Canadian Institute of  Planners, planning involves the scientific, aesthetic,  and orderly disposition of land, resources, facilities  and services with a view to securing the physical,  economic and social efficiency, health and well-being  of urban and rural communities.2   The goals of planning are oriented towards the future.  Therefore, planning is an ongoing, dynamic process  that needs to be attuned and adaptive to changing  environmental conditions, social outlooks and  community visions.   The Planning Process  Approaches used in planning processes vary greatly.  Some processes follow a rigid schedule of meetings,  while others adopt a more flexible workshop approach.  The approach selected is determined, in part, by the  characteristics of the planning area, the specific issues  being addressed, the needs and interests of the  community, and the individuals involved. Planning for  complex environmental, social or economic problems  typically requires a process design that integrates  most, if not all, of the following steps: 3, 4  5     ▪  Involve key decision makers and partners.  Consider who should be engaged in the process  in order for it to work. Strong partnerships make  for a strong plan.   ▪  Characterize the area / issue to identify problems.  If a problem is defined too narrowly, innovative  solutions may be overlooked.   ▪  Model or analyze the situation or problem. It is  important to understand the causes of the problem,  as well as the dynamics that may help solve it.   ▪  Set goals and identify potential solutions,  including resource requirements, and  implementation and feedback procedures.   ▪  Evaluate potential solutions in terms of technical  feasibility, cost effectiveness, probable effects   and political acceptability   ▪  Make decisions and design an   implementation program.   ▪ Implement solutions and take action.  ▪  Monitor and evaluate the success of the plan and  its implementation.   ▪ Modify the plan as required.  Planning with water in mind, or water centric  planning, is a primary objective of Living Water  Smart, British Columbia’s Water Plan. Historically,  the provincial government coordinated planning  for water resources. More recently, First Nations,  local governments, stewardship groups and  other community stakeholders have shared  this responsibility. Examples of collaborative  approaches to planning are profiled throughout  this guide. Living Water Smart advocates for  water and watershed planning to continue to be a  shared, collaborative endeavour.  There is no absolute template to follow for water  and watershed planning. Every planning process  and every plan is different. There are, however,  many elements that are critical to the success of  watershed plans. With this in mind, recommended  guidelines for watershed planning processes  include the following:    ▪  Develop a clear vision, goals, objectives and action  items; and set priorities among these.   ▪  Seek involvement and support from elected  decision-makers and those with legislative or  regulatory responsibilities. The relevant decision  makers have much to offer towards a plan that  can be implemented.   ▪  Ensure full representation of all affected parties,  while keeping the size of the process workable.    ▪  Ensure that the planning process is understood,  used and broadly supported.   ▪  Provide access to appropriate technical and  analytical skills and information resources.   ▪ Obtain sustainable funding.  ▪  Strive for planning that is done before   further development will undermine the  effectiveness of the plan.    ▪  Factor in the impacts of climate change and  interception activities (e.g., farm dams and forestry)  on future water inflows and recharge.   ▪  Include socio-economic analyses to   inform planning.   ▪  Consult with those affected to improve the  quality of decisions and build community  confidence in the fairness of outcomes.   ▪  Give high priority to ensuring that the values and  interests of indigenous peoples are included.   ▪  Develop capacity for learning and improving over  time and the ability to evaluate the process.   ▪  Provide adequate resources to develop   and implement water plans and evaluate   their outcomes.   ▪  Improve monitoring and compliance of the use  of water and other watershed resources.   Ideally, watershed plans and the organizations  involved in implementing the plans should  emerge from the planning process with:   ▪  Improved understanding of the watershed   and how it functions   ▪  Clear objectives of how to manage the water  sustainably and in an integrated manner   ▪  Clearly specified community and  environmental outcomes   ▪  Decisions that are based on the best   available information   ▪  Adequately resourced management   and implementation   ▪  Good integration with other regional and  resource-based plans  It should be acknowledged that planning would  not solve all of the water-related challenges  and conflicts throughout BC. However, it is an  important component of the management and  governance of water resources and watersheds.  2.3 An intROduCtiOn tO  WAteRsheds  Everything in the natural world is connected to  other parts. Changes made to one element of  a system affect many other elements and/or  process throughout the system. A watershed— an area of land that contributes runoff to a lake,  river, stream, estuary or bay—is a complex  and dynamic natural system. Changes to land  cover in upland regions of a watershed affect  downstream hydrology; waste inputs from  one community can affect water quality further  downstream. Impacts to an aquifer, such as  water withdrawal, may ultimately affect the flow  and health of a nearby stream. The various  resources that interact within a watershed—the  land, the surface and ground water, the air and  the organisms within the watershed—cannot  be considered in isolation. By recognizing the  interconnections between the components of a  watershed and by integrating this understanding  into planning and decision making within and  across watershed boundaries, negative human  impacts on watershed health are more likely to  be more effectively managed.   6    Understanding the hydrologic cycle is critical to understanding how  a watershed functions. While both salt water and freshwater are  essential parts of the water cycle, the freshwater that we use on a  daily basis for drinking water, irrigation, andother uses comprises only  1% of all water on Earth. This small proportion of water is “recycled”  through the hydrologic cycle, year after year, through oceans, rivers,  rain and the atmosphere (Figure 1).  When water falls to the earth as either rain or snow, it either:   ▪ Soaks into the ground  ▪  Flows over the surface of the land into a stream, lake,   wetland or the ocean, or   ▪Returns to the atmosphere through evaporation.  The rate of infiltration within a watershed is determined by many  factors, including soil permeability, rate of precipitation and the  amount and type of vegetation cover on the land surface. Human  activity can alter the rate of infiltration by changing the surface  of the land. When rain falls or snow melts too fast to allow for  infiltration, or when the ground is too hard (impermeable) for  infiltration to occur, such as in an urban environment, the water  flows over the land as surface runoff (also called overland flow).  Surface runoff is evident within a watershed as streams, rivers,  lakes, ponds, wetlands and drainage ditches.   Water that infiltrates into the ground can take one of several routes:   ▪  Plant roots may absorb the water, which will be used for  photosynthesis.   This water will eventually leave the plant through the leaves,  transpiring back into the atmosphere.  ▪  Water that is not taken up by plants percolates downwards  through the soil to the fully saturated zone at the level of  the water table, where it becomes groundwater. Significant  collections of groundwater are called aquifers. Aquifers  are sometimes tapped with wells for drinking or irrigation.  Groundwater may eventually flow back to the surface as a spring  or through sub-surface pathways into streams, rivers or lakes.   7  Figure 1 –   The Hydrologic Cycle 5    1   Westland Resources Group Inc. for a partnership of Cowichan Valley Regional District, BC Ministry  of Environment, Fisheries and Oceans Canada, Catalyst Paper Corporation, Cowichan Tribes,  and  Pacific Salmon Commission. 2007.

Miscellaneous.  2.4 RefeRenCes  The areas where precipitation or surface water infiltrates the soil and  enters the groundwater system are known as recharge areas. They are  often in upland areas of a watershed but may also be in low-lying valleys  and floodplain areas. As water evaporates from collecting water bodies, it  is returned to the atmosphere, and the cycle repeats itself. No new water  is produced: the water that we use today is the same water that existed  billions of years ago. How we develop and manage the land within our  watersheds ultimately affects the quality of the water that is available for  use. In the same way that streams and rivers flow through a collecting  basin, the impacts of human activities also flow through a watershed.  It should be acknowledged that there are many different scales of  watersheds. The scale of watershed that is appropriate to effectively plan for,  and manage, a given issue (or issues) will depend on the nature and scope  of those issues and the purpose and scope of the planning process.    3. Preparing for   Climate Change   & its impacts  “Building adaptive capacity requires a strong, unifying  vision; scientific understanding of the problems; an  openness to face challenges; pragmatism in developing  solutions; community involvement; and commitment at  the highest political level”   This section of the guide provides information about climate   change and the range of its potential impacts on water and  watersheds in BC. It also provides basic information about  the adaptation process, including the identification of climate  vulnerabilities, risks, and risk management strategies. Lastly,   this section includes some examples of how these issues can   be integrated into water and watershed planning processes to   help communities address the impacts of climate change.    –Holmes, 1996 in Smit et al. 20011  8    3.1 ClimAte ChAnGe imPACts On WAteR  Climate, in a narrow sense, is usually defined as the ”average weather” over a period of  time. Some of the most familiar climate parameters are temperature, precipitation, humidity,  cloudiness, and wind. Climate change refers to a change in the state of the climate which  can be identified by changes in the mean and/or variability of these parameters, and which  persists for a period of decades or longer. 2     Climate change science suggests that by the middle of the century (2050s), mean annual  temperatures across BC will be 1-3° C warmer on average. Extremely warm temperatures  will become more frequent. A warmer climate will increase growing degree days and frost  free days – increasing the potential for plant growth. In winter, most parts of BC will receive  up to 20% more precipitation. In summer, northern BC will be up to 10% wetter, and  southern BC will be up to 15% drier. In winter and spring, snowfall will decrease. 3 These are  significant changes from a water perspective.  Water resources and the hydrologic cycle are significantly influenced by the climate.  Therefore, water resources are highly sensitive to year-to-year climate variability as well as  long-term changes in climate. Changes in air temperature and precipitation patterns are  noticeably affecting our weather, water cycles and ecology, and are creating impacts on  forests, fisheries, agriculture, recreational opportunities and communities across the province.   Climate change includes changes in the average climate, such as a general warming in  mean annual air temperature, and changes in the frequency of extreme temperature and  precipitation events. Changes in climate will affect physical systems, including stream flows.   Impacts will vary from one location to another and will include lower “normal” stream flows  (i.e., average seasonal and annual flows) and more frequent drought and flood conditions.  There may also be larger streamflows in some regions including larger and earlier peak flows.  Changes in both climate averages and extremes may have a wide range of impacts on  water and watershed resources and these impacts will vary between different regions of the  province. Therefore, we need to consider these impacts within water and watershed plans to  strengthen the ability of communities to manage such impacts. Projected changes are highly  dependent upon location, topography, and watershed type. Some examples of impacts  related to climate change are:   ▪  Decreased seasonal and/or annual water supplies, which may lead to increased conflict among  water users and between human consumption and water uses within the natural environment;   ▪  Degraded water quality, which may impact the suitability of water for drinking and for  agricultural, commercial, industrial, recreational and environmental water uses; and   ▪  Increased frequency and severity of drought, flood and extreme rainfall events, which may  impact water supplies, drainage infrastructure, other critical infrastructure, public and  private property, and—in extreme circumstances— human health.  These and other climate-related impacts will be discussed in more detail in Sections 3, 5, 6  and 7 of this guide, along with suggestions on how to integrate and address these issues  within water and watershed plans.   As expressed in Living Water Smart, British Columbia’s Water Plan,“we need to design  our communities to adapt to our changing climate while thinking long term to revitalize   our natural systems”. At a 2008 conference  of the BC Water and Waste Association, Jim  Mattison, former Assistant Deputy Minister,  Water Stewardship Division, BC Ministry of  Environment, spoke to water managers about the  two responses to climate change: mitigation and  adaptation.“Mitigation and adaptation are both  necessary and complementary strategies to cope  with the climate change challenge. If mitigation  (alleviating the effects of climate change through  reducing greenhouse gasses) is about carbon,  then adaptation (preparing for the changes that  occur) is about water”. 4 While human systems  within impacted watersheds “may adapt to climate  change, albeit at some cost, natural ecosystems  and wildlife cannot adapt very quickly to a sudden,  large change and hence are at risk.” 5    Climate change impacts on water resources,  watershed health, and communities are  anticipated to be complex and significant, and  are expected to vary for different regions of  the province. Projected changes are highly  dependent upon location, topography, and  watershed type. In general there are four different  types of watersheds with different hydrological  regimes, and differences in how these  watersheds are affected by climate change need  to be considered within water, watershed, and/or  adaptation planning:   ▪ Rain-dominated watersheds  ▪ Snow-dominated watersheds  ▪ Transition watersheds  ▪  Coastal watersheds (rain and transition, but with  added the impact of sea level rise).  The range of potential climate-related impacts on  water, watersheds and communities across BC  include the following (see also setion 9. Tools and  Resources for other sources of information on  climate impacts):  Hydrology and Geomorphology   ▪  Changes in the hydrology of rivers, streams and  watersheds, including the volume and timing of  water discharge (e.g., increased frequency and  magnitude of both peak [flood] flows and low  [drought] flows)   ▪  Changes in the geomorphology of rivers, streams  and watersheds, including the volume, sources  and destinations of sediment transport (e.g.,  increased rates and shifting locations of erosion  and sedimentation processes)  Water Quantity   ▪  In some regions, more frequent water shortages  and increased potential for competition among  water uses (e.g., hydroelectricity, irrigation,  communities, recreation and instream flow needs  for aquatic ecosystems), with implications for  transboundary agreements in some cases.   ▪  In some regions there may be an overall reduction  in annual water supply, particularly where water  supplies are partially dependent on snowpack or  glaciers and where water storage is limited.  9    Water Quality   ▪  Increased risk, frequency and magnitude of extreme precipitation events  and related natural hazards such as flood and erosion, resulting in  loss or degradation of land; deposition of silt, sand, gravel and debris;  damage to and disruption of critical infrastructure, property, community  services, farmland, businesses and the environment.    ▪  Increased risks of other water-related hazards such as debris flows,  landslides and avalanches.   ▪  During periods of low water flows, normal waste discharges will  result in higher concentrations of pollutants within water bodies   that receive those wastes   ▪  Saltwater intrusion in coastal regions due to a rise in sea level, in  particular in combination with reduced groundwater tables.   ▪  Increased water turbidity from increased flooding, erosion and sediment  transport, with potential health impacts from water-borne pathogens.  Aquatic Ecosystems   ▪  Continued stresses on fish migration patterns and survival rates of some  populations due to a variety of impacts to freshwater and marine habitat,  including warming water temperatures, low freshwater flows in late  summer and early autumn in some regions, degradation of spawning  and rearing habitat, and changes to food availability and predators in  the marine environment    ▪  Forests that are stressed— for example, from reduced water  supply —are more vulnerable to diseases and pests such as the  mountain pine beetle. Climate change can therefore lead indirectly  to changes in forest cover over large regions, which in turn can  affect watershed functions and processes.   ▪  Longer and drier summers in BC with increased severity and length  of the fire season. Forest fires reduce forest cover, and in turn, may  contribute to faster runoff, and affect stream and river hydrology,  and water quality  Infrastructure   ▪  Increased risk of damage and disruption to drinking water and  wastewater collection, treatment and distribution infrastructure to  due to flooding and erosion.   ▪ Increased impacts on drainage systems.  ▪  Increased risk of damage and disruption to transportation,   energy, communications, and other critical infrastructure due to  flooding and erosion.  The impacts above can interact with a variety of different community  and/or ecosystem vulnerabilities such as:   ▪  Vulnerability of water supplies (quantity and quality) to flooding,  erosion, turbidity, drought and saltwater intrusion;   ▪  Vulnerability of all water use sectors to reduced water supplies   and increased conflict;   ▪  Vulnerability of aquatic and marine ecosystems to warming water  temperatures, shifting hydrological and geomorphological regimes,  low instream flows and shifts in the food web; and    ▪  Vulnerability of people, infrastructure (including but not limited to  drinking water, wastewater and drainage infrastructure), community  services and property due to water–related natural hazards such as  flooding, erosion, debris flows, landslides and avalanches.  In many cases, there can be a cascade of climate-related impacts.  For example, more frequent and/or extreme rainfall events are a  highly probable impact of climate change in many areas of BC. This  can lead to high flows in streams, rivers and drainage systems,  which can cause flooding, erosion, mobilization of contaminants and  downstream sedimentation. Depending on the location and design  of community water and wastewater systems, flooding may impact  the quality of community water supplies, damage or disrupt the  operation of water or wastewater treatment systems, and damage  or disrupt other infrastructure and property. There may also be a risk  to life or injury due to flood events. Although flooding and erosion  are natural processes, extreme rainfall events can have adverse  impacts on the environment, including degradation of water quality,  habitat, and other ecosystem functions and services. This can, in  turn, adversely impact social, cultural and economic values that  are derived from healthy and abundant watershed resources. Thus,  a single storm event can result in devastating, widespread and  long-lasting impacts to the health, resiliency and sustainability of  communities, water resources and watersheds.  3.2 PRePARinG fOR ClimAte ChAnGe –   the AdAPtAtiOn PROCess And WAteR And  WAteRshed PlAnninG  Because of the many, significant, current and projected impacts of  climate change on water resources and watersheds, the value of  planning and adaptation should be self-evident. The better we are  able to understand the changes that are coming and how they are  affecting communities and ecosystems, the better we will be able to  plan for, manage and adapt to these changes.  Many methodologies have been developed to help communities  learn more about the regional impacts of climate change, prioritize  associated risks and opportunities, and develop climate risk   First Nations Concerns  First Nations in Canada have also identified and expressed  concerns about these potential climate change impacts.   In workshops held in Toronto and Vancouver in the summer   of 2010, 18 First Nations from across Canada identified   potential policy directions related to First Nations, water   security and climate change. A report emerging from these  workshops indicated that First Nations in rural areas are  experiencing various impacts of climate change on water  resources, including: 6   ▪Poor water quality;  ▪ Increasing drought;  ▪Rapid glacier melt;  ▪Widespread thawing of permafrost;  ▪ Earlier peak streamflows;  ▪Changing water temperatures; and   ▪Shifting marine ecosystems.  Other climate change impacts on water and watersheds   identified as being of relevance to First Nations in BC include:    ▪  Increased flood damage to buildings,   roads, bridges, rail lines;  ▪  Increased air pollution and exposure to   water- and food-borne pathogens;  ▪  Increased risk to water quantity due to   low water levels; and  ▪  Increased risk to water quality due coastal   erosion and storm surges.  Climate change has also impacted First Nations’ ability   to harvest fish, both commercially and for subsistence   purposes, due to significant changes in fish habitat,   migratory patterns and spawning beds, and to changes   in water quality and temperature.  10    management plans. Some of these methodologies  are listed in in Section 9 Tools and Resources.  More resources are available on the community  adaptation first-stop website “ReTooling for Climate  Change at www.retooling.ca/.  This guide suggests that many water and watershed  planning processes should consider climate change  and its impacts, focusing on how climate has  changed and is likely to change within the planning  region, and the impacts of a changing climate on  water and watersheds within the planning region.  Users of this guide are referred to existing  generic methodologies identified in Tools and  Resources and on the ReTooling website  for details on the steps involved in identifying  regional impacts, vulnerabilities, and risks, and  relevant risk management strategies. The  sections that follow provide additional information  that specifically addresses adaptation in the  context of water and watershed planning.  3.2.1 leARninG AbOut ReGiOnAl  ClimAte ChAnGe imPACts  What are the impacts of climate change on water  and watersheds in my region?  Information about climate change and its impacts  on water and watersheds in BC is available,  although the amount and level of detail varies from  one region to another.   Information about changes in climate, changes in  hydrology, and changes in aquatic and terrestrial  ecosystems in BC during the past century is  available from reports published by the BC Ministry  of Environment, Natural Resources Canada, and  the Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium. See Tools  and Resources for links to key publications.  The planning tool Plan2Adapt provides a good  starting point for learning about future climate.   It provides regionally relevant information about  projected climate for 2020s, 2050s, and 2080s,  based on a standard set of climate model  projections. It presents this information in the form  of simple-to-understand maps, graphs and text.   Users can view the information online as well as  download material for use in presentations and  reports. Users with more technical knowledge can  also download the data used to create the maps  for further analysis. See http://plan2adapt.ca/.  It’s not enough to know what future climate will  look like. Equally important is to understand the  implications of future climate to future stream  flows, water availability, and watershed health in the  planning region. Much of the existing information on  these topics is provincial in scope. There are only a  few regions – including the Okanagan, the Columbia  Basin, and the Lower Mainland – for which detailed  information on water and watersheds exists. Not  all of the existing information is written in simple  language.  Section 9 Tools and Resources provides  links to key sources of information about impacts on  water and watersheds.  Where detailed local or regional information  about future climate or hydrology is not readily   available, communities have been able to obtain it by engaging consultants or the Pacific  Climate Impacts Consortium, or by working with academic researchers and students.    While many communities believe they need accurate information about future climate and future  impacts on water and watersheds, in many cases general information about the direction of these  impacts will be adequate for initial planning purposes. The following information, for example, can  guide water and watershed management decisions:   ▪  Whether or not regional snowpack (a low-cost water storage mechanism)   will likely decrease in future;   ▪  Whether or not summer flows will likely be lower in future, with impacts for   water temperature and health of fish stocks; or   ▪  Whether or not heavy rainfall events – sociated with flooding and stream   turbidity – are becoming more frequent.  3.2.2 exPlORinG lOCAl And ReGiOnAl VulneRAbility   tO ClimAte ChAnGe  How will the impacts of climate change affect water supply, demand, quality and watershed  health in my region?  Science alone cannot provide all the information water and watershed planners need to prepare  for climate change. In many cases it is local people who are in the best position to identify the  water and watershed values they care about, how sensitive those values are to year-to-year  changes in climate, and local capacity to address existing problems.  Some of the adaptation planning methodologies identified in Tools and Resources (section 9  of this guide) describe two types of assessment: vulnerability assessment and risk assessment.  Vulnerability assessment looks specifically at the ability of the community to address emerging  pressures related to climate. Questions for water and watershed planners to consider in assessing  vulnerability related to climate change are:   ▪  What aspects of climate are currently important to our water supply or our   watershed? In particular, how have extreme weather events affected our water   supply or watershed in the past?   ▪  Given projected climate change and related impacts: Is the community water supply likely   to increase or decrease? Is damage to water infrastructure likely to increase or decrease?   ▪  How prepared is our community to projected changes? Are we resilient or vulnerable?  In many cases, climate change will exacerbate existing management challenges, such as  water shortages, water use conflicts, protecting water quality and managing natural hazards –  things that communities are already struggling to address.  11    3.2.3 eVAluAtinG lOCAl And ReGiOnAl Risk RelAted tO  ClimAte ChAnGe  What climate-related risks are priorities for my community in terms of the hazards   and consequences?   Many communities are familiar with risk assessment and risk management.  Preparing for climate change can be approached as just another aspect of risk  management. Risk is the product of the likelihood of a hazard (e.g., flood, fire,  drought, water contamination, landslide) occurring, and the consequences of  exposure to that hazard. Communities can manage risk by reducing exposure to a  hazard or by minimizing its consequences.   Sometimes climate change will introduce a new hazard (for example sea level rise,  glacier loss), or a new consequence (for example new, invasive species). More often,  climate change will increase or decrease the likelihood that a hazard will occur.  Water and watershed planners can use their knowledge of regional climate changes  and its impacts to inform a basic risk assessment. Planners should also consider  whether climate change presents new hazards or consequences relevant to water  and watershed planning.  3.2.4 identifyinG ClimAte Risk mAnAGement stRAteGies   What are the most important short, medium and long-term strategies that my  community can implement to reduce the risks and impacts of climate change?  Once communities have a deeper understanding of past and future climate change,  potential impacts, local vulnerabilities, and priority risks, they will be in a good position  to identify, evaluate and select strategies that will minimize local or regional climate- related risks. Most of these strategies will look familiar.  Where climate change will likely reduce supply, communities can:   ▪  Develop water conservation and/or drought management plans.  ▪  Reduce demand through conservation meausres or more efficient water use.  ▪  Expand the storage capacity of existing water supplies.  ▪  Develop new water supplies or retention structures.  Where climate change will have negative effects on Water Quality, communities can:   ▪  Change design capacity of drainage infrastructure such as storm sewers, catch basins,  and erosion protection structures.   ▪  Manage rainwater on-site to ease demands   on drainage infrastructure.   ▪  Where climate change will negatively affect Other Water and Watershed Values  communities can:   ▪ Protect wetlands and other sensitive habitats.  ▪ Restore riparian and instream habitat.  Currently, there is no list of “best practices” for adaptation. This is because climate  change and its impacts vary from one location to another, and communities vary in  their exposure and ability to cope. In addition, vision, values, risk tolerance, priorities,  resources, and other factors vary from one community to another, so even those facing  similar risks and opportunities may make different adaptation choices. Thus, while many  adaptation options are theoretically possible, communities should evaluate to the extent  possible the likely local costs and benefits of specific strategies before selecting those  they wish to implement.   Where climate change exacerbates existing management challenges, such as water  shortages, water use conflicts, protecting water quality and managing natural hazards,  consideration must be given to the degree to which climate change is compounding  those problems and to how strategies and responses need to be refined to address  additional pressures related to climate change. “No regrets” actions that address both  current and future risk are particularly popular.  12    1  Centre for Indigenous Environmental Resources (2010).

First Nations Water Security and Climate Change: Workshop Report.  3.4 RefeRenCes  13  How can my community integrate climate science and adaptation  into water and watershed planning to help prepare for, and  manage the impacts of climate change?  Minimizing vulnerabilities and managing climate-related risks   are only two of a number of criteria considered in water and  watershed planning processes.   In many cases, climate change exacerbates existing management  challenges, such as water shortages, water use conflicts,  protecting water quality and managing natural hazards. Therefore,  when adaptation is integrated into water and watershed plans,  consideration must be given to the degree to which climate  change is compounding those problems and to how strategies  and responses need to be refined to address additional pressures  related to climate change.   The ways in which adaptation is integrated into water and watershed  planning will be influenced somewhat by the scope and detail of a  particular plan. For example, if the plan presents broad goals and   objectives, references to climate change adaptation may be general.  However, if very specific targets and strategies are identified, the  climate change scenarios, impacts, vulnerabilities and risks should  inform those targets and strategies. The following are a few examples  of how plans can be informed by considering climate change:   ▪  A water conservation or drought management plan would be  informed by future climate scenarios of drought events or water  shortages rather than by historical levels of drought (e.g., an  increased frequency and severity of drought).  ▪  A stormwater, drainage, or flood management plan would  be informed by current hydrological information and by an  understanding of how the hydrological regime is anticipated to  shift in response to climate change.  ▪  A drinking water protection plan would be informed by  information and knowledge about all possible threats to water  quality, including climate-related impacts such as increased   peak flows and turbidity.   3.3 inteGRAtinG AdAPtAtiOn intO WAteR And WAteRshed PlAnninG – sOme exAmPles     4. Who does   What in Water? This section of the guide provides an overview of the wide range  of roles and responsibilities of all orders of government and other  organizations in water management in BC.   Depending on the scope of a particular water or watershed planning  process, many of these organizations will have a role in planning.  The diversity of responsibilities reinforces the value of implementing  collaborative approaches to planning and governance.  It is important to understand how and where water and watershed  planning fits within the larger context of water management and  governance. For this guide, water management is described as  including the following components:   ▪Policies (e.g., legislation, regulations and other types of policies);  ▪  Governance arrangements (e.g., formal agreements and protocols,  financial mechanisms, collaborative decision-making processes,           and consultation, advisory and public participation processes);  ▪  Planning (e.g., a variety of processes to develop water plans, watershed  plans, and other types of plans such as official community plans); and  ▪  Implementation (e.g., implementation of policies and plans,   operation of water and wastewater facilities, compliance and  enforcement of regulations).  Resources such as information, financial and human resources can  also be considered to be a key component of water management.   This guide focuses on the planning component of water management.  However, it also speaks to other components as they relate to  planning. For example, this section includes an overview of the range  of water management roles and responsibilities that exist among a  wide variety of organizations.  Governance can be described in terms of who makes decisions and  how they are made. While government is critical to governance, the  concept is broader than government.   There are a wide range of regulatory and non-regulatory roles,  responsibilities and jurisdictions that span federal, provincial, local  and First Nations governments. In addition, water user groups,  watershed stewards, the general public and other stakeholders  are increasingly becoming involved in planning, management and  decision making for our water resources.   14    4.1 PROVinCiAl GOVeRnment  Under the Canadian Constitution Act, provinces  and territories have primary responsibility for  water management, with a number of ministries  and agencies sharing responsibility for different  aspects of water management. The Province is  the lead jurisdiction for setting policy, legislating  prices, permitting uses, and managing water  sources in BC. Provincial jurisdiction includes  public lands, municipal institutions, local works  and undertakings, non-renewable resources,  property and civil rights, and shared jurisdiction  over agriculture.1 Typically, the Province devolves  the responsibility of community-scale water  management to municipalities or other local  organizations such as water suppliers. In British  Columbia, the BC Water Act (administered by the  Ministry Forests, Lands and Natural Resource  Operations) and the Drinking Water Protection  Act (administered by the Ministry of Health)  provide the basic regulatory framework for water  management. The following are some of the  key provincial roles and responsibilities in water  management and planning.  Ministry of Environment (MoE)  The MoE provides leadership for water  stewardship and promotes responsible water  use, community health and safety, maintenance  of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, and other  priorities. The Ministry applies a stewardship  approach based on the principles of integrated  water resource management. The Ministry of  Environment works in partnership with other  agencies (such as the Ministry of Forests, Lands  and Natural Resource Operations) to deliver this  mandate and ensure the health of the province’s  water resource. MoE roles include:   ▪ Parks, wilderness and protected areas;  ▪ Air, land and water quality standards;  ▪ Pollution prevention and waste management;  ▪ Species and ecosystem protection policy;  ▪ Water protection and water sustainability policy;  ▪ Water and air monitoring and reporting;  ▪  Conservation and resource management  enforcement;   ▪ Climate action secretariat;  ▪ Environmental assessment office;  ▪ State of environment reporting; and,  ▪ Environmental monitoring.  The MoE also provides the following support roles  in water stewardship, including:   ▪ Assists with policy and plan development;  ▪  Assists with continual evolution of  legislation and policy;   ▪  Develops innovative approaches to   water governance;   ▪  Assists with the development of regulatory   and non-regulatory tools;   ▪  Leads and reports on living water   smart implementation;   ▪ Provides source water protection;  ▪  Provides groundwater monitoring and  protection; and,   ▪ Provides water quality and quantity monitoring.  The Ministry provides information, research and   knowledge about BC’s water resources:  ▪ Collects water-related data;  ▪  Provides scientific analysis and guidance in support of   planning and stewardship;   ▪  Provides forecasts and models to support risk management   and decision making; and,   ▪ Collaborates in water science research.  Ministry of Environment branches have responsibilities for protecting  and restoring fish habitat, monitoring ambient water quality, permitting  activities that affect water quality, monitoring aquifer levels, and  enforcing water regulations.  Ministry of Forests, Lands and Natural Resource Operations   Water-related responsibilities of the MFLNRO include:   ▪  Administering the water act and the water protection   act and associated regulations   ▪ Aquaculture licensing and regulation;  ▪ Water use planning and authorizations;  ▪  Aboriginal consultation and coordination–  natural resource operations;   ▪ Provincial hatchery and stocking program;  ▪ Watershed restoration;  ▪ Fish, wildlife and habitat management;  ▪ Drought management;  ▪ Dam and dyke safety and regulation;   ▪ Floodplain management;  ▪ Resource management compliance;  ▪  Manages and protects water as a forest resource   under the forest and range practices act;   ▪  Integrated land management bureau considers water in   regional land and resource planning; and,   ▪  Front counter bc provides clients with information on water   licences and approvals and assists with processing their applications.  Ministry of Health    ▪  Administers the drinking water protection act and associated regulations;  ▪  Mandate for drinking water protection under the drinking   water protection act;   ▪  Interagency memorandum of understanding for the protection of  drinking water commits all provincial agencies to consider drinking   water protection in their statutory decisions and approvals; and,   ▪  Drinking water protection officers have statutory authority to ensure  potable water supplies are protected.  Ministry of Agriculture   ▪  Supports agricultural industry water requirements used in the   production of food and agricultural products.  Ministry of Energy   ▪  Develops energy policy and works to sustainably support industry  water requirements.  Oil and Gas Commission   ▪  Issues approvals for short-term water use and for changes in   and around a stream in connection with authorizations for oil   and gas development.  15    Ministry of Community, Sport and Cultural Development   ▪  Provides water infrastructure and planning funding;  ▪  Supports local government activities under the local  government act;   ▪  Assists with the development of regional growth strategies   and relations between local government and first nations.   Ministry of Public Safety and the Solicitor General   ▪  Coordinates response to water-related emergencies such as  floods, and provides funding to mitigate hazards.  Ministry of Aboriginal Relations and Reconciliation   ▪  Leads the negotiation of treaties that consider water as   a resource of interest.  Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure    ▪  Approves rural subdivision developments, including the  assessment of potential risks and obstacles involving water  supply and sewage disposal.  Environmental Assessment Office   ▪  Coordinates the assessment of proposed major projects  under the environmental assessment act to ensure they are  conducted in a sustainable manner.  In addition to these roles and responsibilities, new   provincial plans and policies are emerging. The following   are two key developments.  Living Water Smart:  In June 2008 the provincial government released Living Water  Smart: British Columbia’s Water Plan. The plan establishes new  provincial water priorities to keep our water healthy and secure  for the future by taking into consideration the challenging context  of water management in BC today. In anticipation of continuing  competing demands for water, a growing population, and the  effects of climate change on our communities, Living Water Smart  outlines 45 new commitments, divided into three categories:    ▪ Doing Business Differently.  ▪ Preparing Communities for Change.  ▪ Choosing to Be Water Smart.  The plan sets specific commitments and targets to help  ensure that a finite supply of water (or potentially a reduced  supply) will go further without compromising nature’s needs.  For example:   ▪  By 2012, government will regulate groundwater use in priority  areas and large groundwater withdrawals.   ▪  Government will support communities to do watershed  management planning in priority areas.   ▪  By 2020, water use in BC will be 33% more efficient.  ▪  Government will improve the quality and protection of drinking  water sources.   ▪  50% of new municipal water needs will be acquired through  conservation by 2020.  Many of these commitments and targets will have direct  impacts on communities across the province. To help  advance these commitments, the plan draws on a variety  of policy “tools”, including planning, regulatory change,  education, and incentives like economic instruments   and rewards. 2 See Living Water Smart:   http://livingwatersmart.ca/ for more information.  Looking Ahead – Modernizing the Water Act  As part of the commitment to Living  Water Smart, and in response to new  water management challenges including  population growth and climate change, the BC  Government is looking at ways to modernize  the Water Act. Initiated in 2008, this significant  undertaking is considering new arrangements  to address water management challenges in  BC, with the following goals:  1.  Protect stream health and aquatic  environments;  2. Improve water governance arrangements; 3.  Introduce more flexibility and efficiency in    the water allocation system; and, 4. Regulate groundwater extraction and use.  The initiative has included a public engagement  process, distribution of a Discussion Paper,  Technical Background Report, and a Report  on Engagement. In December 2010, the BC  Government released a Policy Proposal on  BC’s new Water Sustainability Act for public  comment. See www.livingwatersmart.ca/water- act/ for more information.  At the time this Guide was published,  Government was further refining the proposal  and assessing implications. Every effort will  be made to update this Guide to reflect any  changes to planning related to the Water  Sustainability Act if and when it is enacted.  Key policy areas under consideration and  relevant to water and watershed planning  include:    ▪   Protecting stream health and aquatic  environments through the protection of  instream flows through enforceable terms  and conditions in water licences;   ▪  Establishment of Provincial Water Objectives  to guide decisions made by statutory decision  makers under the new Act and other laws  affecting land and resource use on Crown and  private land;   ▪  Regulation of groundwater extraction and use  for all large groundwater withdrawals across  BC and smaller withdrawals in problem areas.  All existing and new large groundwater users  throughout the province will be required to  obtain a licence or an approval;   ▪  Regulating water during times of scarcity  using a staged approach that includes  efficiency and conservation measures, priority  date and proportional reduction targets;   ▪  Enabling a range of economic instruments,  incentives and best management practices to  improve water security, water use efficiency,  conservation and beneficial use;   ▪  Additional requirements for measuring and  reporting on water use;   ▪  Enabling a range of governance   approaches to support increased  collaboration and participation in activities  and decision processes, including the ability  to delegate responsibility for activities and  decisions to others;  16     ▪  Water resource assessments that consider available and anticipated water supply and  demand, and potential conditions for water use;   ▪  Watershed sustainability plans in areas where degraded watersheds require recovery action  and will affect both land and water development and use.  4.2 fedeRAl GOVeRnment  The Constitution Act assigns the federal government a specific set of water management  responsibilities, including navigable waters, commercial fisheries and fish habitat, water  on First Nations land, transboundary flows, international relations, trade and commerce,  agriculture, and federal lands. 1 The federal government also develops water policy. For  example, refer to: Federal Water Policy. The following are some of the key federal roles and  responsibilities in water management and planning:  Environment Canada    ▪  Operates hydrometric, climate and water quality monitoring   networks in partnership with the provincial ministry of environment;    ▪  Undertakes research on water quality and quantity, watershed   management and climate change.  Fisheries and Oceans Canada   ▪  Administers the fisheries act, which protects anadromous and marine fish habitats.  Aboriginal Affairs & Northern Development Canada   ▪  Manages water on indian reserves jointly with First Nation governments.  Health Canada   ▪  Sets drinking water standards for canadians.  Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada   ▪  Conducts research and provides information on water use in   agriculture and agricultural impacts on the water resource.  Transport Canada   ▪ Regulates transportation on water.  Natural Resources Canada   ▪  Conducts research on groundwater and hydrologic impacts of climate change.  Over the years, the federal government has also had roles in funding infrastructure, including  water, wastewater and flood protection infrastructure. In 2011, at the time this guide  was completed, these functions were implemented through the Building Canada Fund,  administered by Infrastructure Canada.  4.3 fiRst nAtiOns GOVeRnment  At present, the roles of First Nations in water planning, management and governance relate  to legally assigned responsibilities in the administration of federal water policies, and the  management of provincially or federally assigned roles. While Aboriginal rights to water  have not been eliminated, and governance (i.e. jurisdiction) of water resources is a goal  for many BC First Nations, few if any existing forums formalize Aboriginal rights to, and  governance of, water.   First Nations hold more than 700 active provincial water licences for a wide range of  purposes associated with Indian Reserves. These licences are held either by a First Nation  or jointly by the First Nation and Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada.  Legally, the protection and provision of water to First Nations is a responsibility of the federal  government, specifically Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada (AANDC).  Band Councils, AANDC and Health Canada share responsibilities for providing water services  to Aboriginal communities. Band Councils are responsible for ensuring that drinking water  systems are run in accordance with the Protocol for Safe Drinking Water in First Nations  Communities (developed by AANDC), and for implementing drinking water monitoring  programs on reserves. AANDC provides financial assistance for water facilities, and Health  Canada works with communities to ensure water quality monitoring programs are in place,  trains the monitors, and provides community-based education on water issues.3 However,  concerns about the extent to which the federal government has met these responsibilities   are well documented. Many First Nations have  been left with limited capacity to manage water  resources, and as a result, their populations are  disproportionately vulnerable to water-borne  diseases, drinking water advisories and health  effects associated with poor water quality. 4    Legally, the provincial government is obligated  to consult with First Nations on water use  decisions that might affect them. This relationship  is defined by the Supreme Court of Canada  (e.g., Delgamukw and Haida), and is reflected in  the “New Relationship” that was struck in 2005  between the Province and the First Nations  Leadership Council. 5   4.4 lOCAl GOVeRnment  Local governments have significant roles to play  in water and watershed management. In BC,  local government includes municipalities, regional  districts, and improvement districts. In order  for local governments to have jurisdiction over  specific subjects, they first need authorization  from the Province under the Community Charter  and the Local Government Act. It is important to  note that municipalities and regional districts have  somewhat different jurisdictions and procedures.  For example, for some water-related functions  such as drainage and flood protection, regional  districts may need to first establish a specific  function and service delivery area following a  referendum to confirm (or deny) public consent.   In BC, local governments are gaining more  discretionary powers over local matters, as  demonstrated by changes to the Community  Charter.6 The following are some of the key local  government roles and responsibilities in water  management and planning:   ▪  Development and management of municipal water  supplies, including treatment and distribution  systems. This includes provision of safe drinking  water in accordance with the public health act;   ▪  Development and management of municipal  drainage and wastewater treatment systems;   ▪  Responsibility for floodplain management under  the flood hazard statutes amendment act;   ▪ Delivery of local water conservation programs;  ▪  Responsibility for local land use planning and  development on private lands, including the  protection and management of riparian areas,  wetlands and other sensitive habitats;   ▪  Responsibility for the operation and maintenance  of flood protection infrastructure in their local  areas; and,   ▪ Water and watershed planning.  17    Local governments have contributed to water  management planning across the province by  initiating, managing and participating in various  activities related to water management and  planning, including:   ▪  Developing water conservation plans   and drought management plans;   ▪  Participating in or leading multi-sector   water planning initiatives;   ▪  Developing floodplain management   plans and strategies;   ▪  Developing liquid waste management plans   and integrated stormwater management plans;    ▪  Developing integrated watershed   management plans; and   ▪  Developing official community plans and   regional growth strategies. 7    Local governments also promote community and  economic development, which has the potential to  impact water resources. 8    In addition to the planning processes listed  above (and those discussed in Sections 5  through 7 of the guide), local governments across  BC are drawing on other innovative tools and  approaches to help protect watersheds and plan  for water resources.   4.5 OtheR ORGAnizAtiOns  Many other organizations have important roles  to play when it comes to water. The following are  some of these organizations and their roles and  responsibilities in water management and planning:  Industry   ▪  Relies on water as a vital component of  production; and,   ▪  Develops plans, policies, procedures and  practices regarding water use, efficiency and  wastewater for individual business operations.  BC Hydro   ▪  Is licensed to use the largest amount of surface  water in the province, with operations that depend  on reliable, carefully managed water supplies;   ▪  Works to reduce the need to expand hydropower  operations by encouraging consumer energy  conservation; and,   ▪  Develops water use plans, which modify  hydropower dam operations to mitigate their impact  on downstream fish habitat and other values.  Academic Institutions   ▪  Conduct critical research on topics such as water quality and  quantity, impacts of climate change, watershed functioning,  groundwater and aquifer function, governance policy, demand  management; and,   ▪  Provide education and training to future water managers.  Professional Associations   ▪  Provide policy advice, planning support, technical support,  knowledge sharing and a wide range of services related  to water planning, management, and operations (e.g. BC  Water and Wastewater Association, the BC Ground Water  Association, and the Canadian Water Resources Association,  geo scientists, engineers, planners, biologists, geographers  and many other professionals.  Community Organizations and Individuals   ▪  Provide vital services through outreach, conservation,  restoration of source water, and maintenance or restoration   of aquatic habitat;   ▪  Are enabled to take greater responsibility for water stewardship  through new, collective shared stewardship approaches; and,   ▪  Work to advance sustainability across local and regional  watersheds, help resolve stakeholder conflicts and educate the  public about water issues.  4.6 mOVinG fORWARd in WAteR PlAnninG,  mAnAGement & GOVeRnAnCe  As will become evident in later sections of this guide, a wide  array of planning processes have been developed to assist  local governments and other organizations in navigating the  challenges of water management. In some regions of the  province, significant momentum is building towards collaborative  decision-making regarding watershed health in the face of  economic and environmental change. As policy makers analyze  and adjust management strategies with the current social,  political, economic and environmental context, and as managers  strategize to resolve conflicts between human and ecosystem  needs, communities are learning to live water smart. The  outlook is encouraging. In addition to the emergence of a new  Water Act for BC, an overarching provincial policy framework  presently exists comprised of Living Water Smart and the Green  Communities Initiative, two complementary initiatives. Living  Water Smart provides the vision of the framework, and the Green  Communities Initiative complements the Local Government  Act tools to enable the vision. As a package, the framework  provides guidance for aligning local actions with provincial and  regional goals to “design with nature”, in order to create greener  communities, live water smart and prepare for climate change.

These include  (but are not limited to) population growth,  community and economic development,  infrastructure and asset management, and the  need for environmental stewardship.   It is also becoming increasingly important to consider the  impacts of climate change when planning and managing  water supply and demand. Climate change is having, and will  continue to have, far-reaching implications on all aspects of  water management.  In Canada, water allocation and licensing decisions are the  responsibility of the provincial government. In BC, these  responsibilities are administered by the Ministry of Forests,  Lands, and Natural Resource Operations (MFLNRO), which  issues water licences. MFLNRO balances responsible use,  community health and safety, maintaining terrestrial and  aquatic ecosystems and other priorities.  Once water licences are issued, the management of water  supply and demand becomes largely the responsibility of  those that hold the licenses including local governments, First  Nations, and other community-scale water suppliers. These  groups develop and manage community water supplies as well  as treatment and distribution systems. Local and First Nations  governments also have roles in developing and implementing  various water-related plans and programs. These include  strategies to conserve water and manage demand and also  to mitigate the impacts of drought. Local governments, First  Nations and other water suppliers also participate in, or lead,  multi-sector water and watershed planning initiatives. We all  use water, so as citizens, farmers, ranchers and countless other  businesses and industries that use water, we all share in the  responsibilities to manage our water use.  Types of Water Supply & Demand Plans This section of the guide profiles four specific types of plans:   ▪Water Conservation Plans  ▪Drought Management Plans  ▪Water Use Plans  ▪Water Allocation Plans  20    Why Plan for Water Supply and Demand?  There are many pressures on watershed that are placing – and will  continue to place – pressures on water supply and demand. Common  pressures throughout BC include population growth, land use practices,  community and economic development, climate change and other  changes in ecosystems (such as the Mountain Pine Beetle infestation).  Therefore the extent of existing water use requirements and the  hydrological characteristics of watersheds are important considerations in  managing supply and demand.   BC communities are adopting a wide range of strategies to manage  water. Water planning processes can help communities understand  challenges by improving knowledge about water supplies and demands  including sharing the allocation of water across various human activities  and also ensuring that environmental needs (i.e. instream flows) are also  met. For a comparison of three water management techniques (supply  side, demand management, and the “soft path” approach) see the 2005  POLIS publication At a Watershed. These approaches can be especially  helpful in managing community conflicts during times of water shortages  and drought. The process of water management planning also serves to  increase awareness in a community, and stakeholders will be more likely  to promote responsible water management practices in their homes,  businesses and neighbourhoods.  Water supply, demand and allocation management are primarily about  balancing water use. These include human water uses for domestic,  agricultural, hydroelectrical, commercial and industrial consumption,  as well as natural system water uses to support healthy ecosystems,  particularly fish and fish habitat. Good water management can allow for  human use without compromising the environment. Desired outcomes  of water planning may include:   ▪  Managing water use and consumption rates to account for seasonal and  annual changes (e.G. Reducing use in months that are especially dry and  in years with lower snowpacks and less recharge of water supplies)  ▪  Managing water use and consumption rates for long term changes in  an area, such as climate change and population growth  ▪  Developing and managing water supplies in ways that do not  compromise the health and biodiversity of fish, wildlife, ecosystems   and watersheds in general  ▪  Managing for recreational non-consumptive water uses, such   as swimming, fishing and canoeing  ▪  Managing the future allocation of water in ways that support a variety  of high-value water uses, including human consumptive and non- consumptive uses as well as environmental needs.  Challenges and Pressures  Water supply is a significant issue in many communities in BC and  around the world. Water supply is particularly important in regions  where supplies may be limited, storage capacity is limited, and/or   water demand is nearing or exceeding water  supply. The characteristics of water supply and  demand are community specific, and depend on  many factors. The following are a few examples of  topics and factors to illustrate the range of water  supply and demand challenges experienced in  communities across BC.  Total and Seasonal Population Growth   Some communities and regions, such as the  Lower Mainland, the east coast of Vancouver  Island and parts of the Thompson-Okanagan  region, are experiencing significant population  growth. This growth puts increased demand and  pressure on existing water supplies, particularly  where supplies are already stressed. Communities  that are heavily influenced by seasonal tourism  may have unique challenges in managing seasonal  fluctuations in demand for domestic use. For  example, in Tofino, the population grows 10-fold in  the summer because of the significant amount of  tourism in the area. This is the same time when the  creeks are at their lowest flow-levels.   Drought Conditions  When communities are faced with water  shortages or drought conditions, conflicts  between different water users may emerge or  increase. For example, in 2003, Summerland’s  water supply was substantially depleted, which  resulted in a significant conflict between the  provision of water in streams to ensure fish  survival and the provision of water for farmers  and food production. In extreme cases, senior  levels of government may intervene in water  allocation issues. In the spring of 2010, the BC  Ministry of Environment used its authority under  the Water Act, to change the regulated amount  of diversion and use of water, and invoked  priority rights in the Chimney Lakes area.   Surface and Groundwater Interactions  Conflicts may also arise between users of  surface water and users of groundwater because  these sources are often closely linked. For  example, excessive withdrawal of groundwater  may reduce groundwater contribution to  instream flows, particularly in the dry summer  months when streams, aquatic ecosystems and  other users of surface water are most vulnerable  to low flows. Also excessive surface water  withdrawal can lead to groundwater sources  being depleted, as some aquifers are recharged  from surface supplies such as rivers.  Aging and Inadequate Infrastructure  Many BC communities are also facing challenges  associated with aging infrastructure, such as  inadequate supply capacity or leaky distribution  systems. Water infrastructure is very expensive  to replace and upgrade, and often water  conservation is viewed as a preferable alternative  to increasing capacity. Because of the wider  infrastructure deficit throughout BC and Canada,  water infrastructure – for water supply and  distribution, wastewater treatment, drainage and  flood protection – has to compete with other  types of infrastructure for limited capital funds.   21    Climate Considerations  Climate change is impacting, and will continue  to impact, many aspects of water supply and  management in BC. Reduced annual and  seasonal precipitation, reduced snowpacks,  loss of glaciers, changing surface and  groundwater hydrology, increased drought and  increased demand for irrigation are just a few  examples. These and other climate-related  impacts should be addressed in plans that aim  to consider medium to long-term pressures  on water supply and demand. The plans  should develop solutions for dealing with those  pressures. See sections 3 and 9 of this guide  for information, tools and resources about  climate change impacts on water, related  community vulnerabilities and risks, as well as  considerations about how climate impacts can  be managed through adaptation and water  and watershed planning.   5.1 WAteR COnseRVAtiOn PlAns  Water conservation planning is receiving  more and more attention in BC. There is a  growing appreciation of the limited availability  of water supplies, and an increasing concern  about the impacts of climate change on water  supply and demand. Water conservation is  one of the best mechanisms to manage water  demand within existing supplies, and avoid  the cost of developing additional supplies.  Rainwater harvesting, leak detection and  repairs, and greywater recycling are just a  few water conservation strategies that can  reap significant benefits for communities.  Conservation is particularly important in areas  that are experiencing population growth,  economic development and other changes  that lead to increased demand for water.  Water conservation is important in areas where  there may be a reduced water supply in the  future as a result of climate change.   Characteristics, Benefits and Applications  Water conservation plans focus on managing  water demand, reducing consumption, and  improving efficiency of water use. These plans  extend beyond household water savings to  include industrial, commercial, institutional and  agricultural water users. The plans, are relevant  to both surface and groundwater sources.  Water conservation plans can help  communities manage the impacts of water  shortages that are less severe than drought  conditions. These plans can also deliver  benefits to communities that are not presently  experiencing water shortages. Through  conservation, water suppliers can reduce the  costs associated with developing new water  supplies, drinking water treatment, drinking  water distribution, wastewater treatment and  associated pumping and energy costs.   Local governments in BC are now required to  have water conservation plans to be eligible for   provincial capital grant funding for drinking  water and wastewater infrastructure.  Water conservation plans are typically  developed at the geographic scale of  a community or region. It is important  to consider all water users (residential,  agricultural, industrial), all water supplies  (surface and groundwater) and how these  users and supplies interact with, and  affect, each other. Therefore, the use of  a holistic approach or “watershed eye- view” to water conservation planning is  beneficial. This translates into considering  entire watersheds in the decision-making  process, and integrating all aspects of  water management into the plan.    Key Elements and Steps  The following are some of the key  elements and steps in preparing a Water  Conservation Plan:   ▪  Developing a comprehensive community  water use profile that outlines the  amounts of water used by different  sectors (such as household, industrial,  agricultural, municipal and other use);  ▪  Forecasting future water supplies   and demands;  ▪  Developing a future vision of water   use and supply for the community;  ▪  Quantifying and understanding the  impacts of different water conservation  measures; and,  ▪  Integrating the water conservation plan  with other plans (e.g., Regional growth  strategies, official community plans,  land use plans, transportation plans,  integrated community sustainability  plans and watershed plans).  The POLIS Project on Ecological  Governance is a BC-based organization  that has undertaken significant research on  water issues and has recently published a  guide on water conservation planning.   POLIS characterizes a strong water  conservation plan as having:   ▪ At least a 20–50 year time frame;  ▪  A comprehensive and thoughtful rationale   for water conservation;   ▪  An integrated approach to water  conservation, which is linked to other plans  such as wastewater, land use, and asset  management plans; and   ▪ An effective implementation strategy.  POLIS characterizes an excellent water  conservation plan, as one that goes further to:   ▪ Place ecological health at its core;  ▪  Be tailored to a community’s watershed  context and consider the community’s impact  on the watershed;   ▪  Blend innovative legal tools such as water  restrictions and land use planning bylaws  with practical measures such as rebate and  metering programs;   ▪  Make managing demand a part of daily  business rather than a stop-gap measure  designed merely to buy time needed to  increase supply;   ▪  Build in measures that are geared towards  rainwater capture and wastewater  reclamation, reuse and recycling to better  match water quality to end uses;   ▪  Implement outreach and education programs  that go beyond information dissemination to  engage and inspire citizens to permanently  change behaviour; and,   ▪   Use a “triple bottom line” approach to   valuing water. 2  While it may not be possible or practical in  all cases for communities to achieve these  characteristics, it is important to consider them  during the development and implementation   of water conservation plans to ensure the  plans are effective, comprehensive and  successfully implemented.  5.2 dROuGht mAnAGement PlAns  The Province of BC defines drought as a  period of sustained low precipitation and high  evaporation, resulting in low stream flows and  groundwater levels, and water shortages.   22    Significant drought is characterized by particularly low stream flows.   “In British Columbia, drought may be caused by combinations of insufficient snow  accumulation, hot and dry weather or a delay in rainfall. Hydrological drought is associated  with the effect of low precipitation on water levels in rivers, reservoirs, lakes and aquifers.  Hydrological drought affects uses which depend on ground and surface water levels and  stream flows.”  –Living Water Smart 3     BC communities have experienced drought in the past and will continue to do so in  the future. Drought is a projected impact of climate change in BC so communities  might experience more frequent or severe drought conditions than in the past. Drought  circumstances can have profound impacts on the socio-economic and environmental  health of communities including agriculture and food. Aquatic ecosystems and fisheries  are also affected by drought conditions. When water availability is very low, there can also  be concerns about water quality, because pollution levels are relatively concentrated, and  more bacteria can survive in warmer water. Lower water availability can also lead to higher  costs of water, and restrictions on water use. Water use restrictions can in turn impact  business operations, employment, personal use and tourism. There is a strong rationale for  undertaking a broad assessment and analysis of overall water allocation in a community or  region to help inform the development and implementation of a Drought Management Plan.   Characteristics, Benefits and Applications  Drought management plans are an important means of minimizing the impacts of water  shortages and drought in a region. Similar to water conservation plans, they focus on  managing demand, reducing consumption and improving efficiency of water use. Like  conservation plans, effective drought management plans need to consider all water uses  (including household, industrial, commercial, institutional and agricultural). These plans  place an emphasis on reducing water demand but are developed to address the extreme  circumstances associated with drought.   Drought management plans are typically developed at the community or regional scale. It is  important to consider all uses of a particular water supply such as a watershed or aquifer, and  the interactions between water supplies. A watershed-based approach is particularly relevant  because a drought event typically affects a large area and all types of water supplies.  A key characteristic of drought management plans is that they identify drought stages  and trigger appropriate response actions. The Province of BC uses a four level drought  classification (normal, dry, very dry and extremely dry) to describe the severity of drought  conditions and appropriate levels of response. Drought management plans develop specific  responses to these drought stages and triggers (e.g., limiting lawn watering if a reservoir  drops to a specified level).  Drought management plans should be developed before conditions require their use.  Because of the potentially severe socio-economic and environmental impacts of droughts,  emotions can run very high during these events. Therefore, planning well in advance of a  drought will allow more time for thoughtful, rational and comprehensive planning than when  a community is already experiencing a drought situation. A proactive approach also enables  farmers, ranchers, other businesses, institutions and households to assess the plans in  advance of a drought and offer feedback. These groups of stakeholders can also take  measures to prepare for the challenges and opportunities associated with implementing  drought management and water conservation measures.  Key Elements and Steps  The Dealing With Drought Handbook –  published by the BC Ministry of Environment in  2004 and available online – provides a common  template for developing Drought Management  Plans. The following are some of the key  elements and steps in preparing such a plan:   ▪ Establish a local drought management team;  ▪  Document the membership and   operating procedures of the local drought  management team.  ▪Document the water system profile;  ▪  Evaluate the potential impacts of drought   on the region’s economy;  ▪  Evaluate the potential impacts of drought   on the social & environmental well-being   of the region;  ▪  Identify data requirements, frequency of data  collection and reporting protocols on local  water supplies and climate;  ▪  Develop clear definitions of local drought stages  and corresponding local responses; and  ▪ Prepare communications plans.   The province of BC has established a Drought  Management Framework – refer to Drought  Information, for information on:    ▪Drought Advisories;  ▪  Levels of Water Shortages and   Drought Conditions;  ▪ The Provincial Drought Response;  ▪ Individual Drought Response Measures;  ▪Resources; and  ▪  Snow Surveys and Additional Important Info.  5.3 WAteR use PlAns  When it comes to water planning and  management, a wide variety of human uses  and instream environmental needs must be  considered and balanced. Water use planning  is one approach to achieving this balance  for a specified watercourse, watershed and/ or water facility such as a reservoir. To date,  Water Use Plans (WUP) have for the most part  been associated with waterpower licences  that are held by BC Hydro. The Comptroller of  Water Rights or other appropriate authorities  under the Water Act may require that a WUP  be prepared for any existing licence. Expected  priorities for the completion of plans are power  developments, municipal water systems, and  larger-scale industrial operations. WUPs may  also be required for other water control facilities  where there is an undesirable effect on fish,  aquatic habitat, or other important values. While  WUPs for existing licences may be required as  needs are identified, plans may also be required  as a condition of proponents seeking new  licences for larger-scale operations (industrial,  agricultural, municipal, or other facilities), or  for works located on particularly valuable or  sensitive streams.  23    Characteristics, Benefits and Applications  A Water Use Plan is a formal agreement that clarifies how water will  be shared among water licensees while still providing adequate flows  for fish and wildlife. A water licensee leads the planning process.  The overarching goal of a Water Use Plan is to find “a better balance  between competing uses of water, such as domestic water supply,  fish and wildlife, recreating, heritage and electrical power needs,  which are environmentally, socially and economically acceptable  to British Columbians”. As such, Water Use Plans can help resolve  conflicts among competing water users. To be effective, the plans  need to consider all water uses and water licencees within a specified  watercourse or watershed, as well as instream flow requirements for  fish and aquatic ecosystems.   A watershed-based approach is particularly relevant because it  includes all water uses, including instream environmental flows. The  water use planning process has provided valuable information about  environmental flow requirements in many of BC’s water systems.  Water Use Plans may result in an agreement to amend a water license,  resulting in a change in legal rights. They can also support water use  regulation through voluntary changes to water use within existing water  rights. The Guidelines state that if there are financial impacts on the  licensee related to a reduction in water rights, compensation for losses  will be an important consideration.  The Water Use Plan process could be broadly applied to other licence  holders in BC because it has shown “great promise in dealing with  conflicts among owners of water licences and non-licenced users  of water, such as fish and aquatic resources”. Local and regional  governments may also develop Water Use Plans. For example, the  District of Summerland in the Okanagan region used the water use  planning process for Trout Creek (Summerland Water Use Plan). “Metro  is developing a Joint Water Use Plan for the Seymour and Capilano  Watersheds. This Water Use Plan is about how the reservoirs and  dams are operated, how water is released from the reservoirs and how  it is allocated (as examples: drinking water, fisheries habitat, proposed  power generation)... The planning process will explore whether and how  hydropower generation from existing reservoirs can be accommodated  within Metro Vancouver’s commitment to: continue to supply clean,  safe drinking water, protect fish habitat, adapt to climate variability and  climate change. Other community interests such as recreation, culture  and heritage, and safety, will be reviewed within the context of the  planning process.“ (Metro Vancouver Water Use Plan).  To date, all Water Use Plans have been prepared for surface water  resources. This type of planning process is unlikely to be applicable  to groundwater resources within current contexts. Although the Water  Act vests ownership of both surface and groundwater to the province  of British Columbia, the Act does not require a licence to withdraw  and use subsurface water. However, groundwater regulation is within  the scope of the Water Act Modernization initiative. Assessing the role  of groundwater resources in maintaining instream flows and related  surface water values is extremely complicated. Therefore, Water Use  Plans may be an inappropriate or impractical approach to planning  for groundwater resources at this time. However, some of the other  characteristics and benefits of Water Use Plans could potentially be  adapted to plan for and manage groundwater resources. Facilitating  collaborative, multi-sector planning to achieve a balance across multiple  water users and management goals is a key attribute of Water Use  Plans that could be adapted to groundwater strategies.   As of 2010, 24 Water Use Plans had been completed for BC Hydro  facilities. For more information on these plans see: Water Use Planning  or BC Hydro Water Use Planning www.bchydro.com/planning_ regulatory/water_use_planning.html?WT.mc_id=rd_wup.   Key Elements and Steps  The following are some of the key elements and steps in   preparing a Water Use Plan:   ▪  Develop the plan in accordance with the provincial water   use plan guidelines;   ▪  Ensure the plan is consistent with the water act and the fisheries act;  ▪  Develop the plan through an inclusive, consultative, multi-stakeholder  planning process associated with a water act licence, and include  local, provincial, federal and first nations governments, local citizens,  industrial users, water licence holders and other interest groups;  ▪  Undertake hydrological studies, modeling, and assessments  of instream flow requirements to develop a water budget that  characterizes water supply and demand within the planning area;  ▪  Define the proposed operating parameters to be applied in the day- to-day operations of hydroelectric or other water storage facilities;  ▪  Under the water act the comptroller’s responsibility relates  to amending waterpower licences and issuing orders to help  implement: “operational changes, monitoring studies and physical  works outlined in the plan”; and,  ▪  Implement the plan in accordance with conditions stated in the  water licence renewal or amendment, or through an engineers’  orders under the water act.  5.4 WAteR AllOCAtiOn PlAns  When planning for water allocation, a wide variety of human and  ecosystem needs must be identified and balanced. Water allocation  planning is an approach to achieving this balance in the future for  a specified watershed or for a large water source. For example  the Lemieux Creek Water Availability Report - 2004 is a water  availability study that is used to some extent as a WAP. It is very  important to undertake this type of planning before a watershed  approaches its limits of available supply relative to future demands,  and before drought or other extreme conditions threaten good  relationships between stakeholders.  Water Allocation Plans were first developed on Vancouver Island,  as a means to facilitate making water allocation decisions by the  Regional Water Manager under the Water Act. WAPs for other  regions of the province may follow. See Water Allocation Plans.  Characteristics, Benefits and Applications  The Ministry of Forests, Lands and Natural Resource Operations  (MFLNRO) may lead or provide assistance to the WAP planning  process. The plan allows for information about the Ministry’s position  on water allocation decisions to be made available to future water  license applicants and the public. By providing greater clarity,  consistency and transparency regarding water allocation decisions,   24    Water Allocation Plans can help avoid or reduce potential  conflicts related to future water licence applications.   Water Allocation Plans are considered regional policy,  and the MFLNRO uses these plans while exercising its  authority (e.g. issuing water licences) under the Water Act.  The plans are operational tools developed and used by the  Ministry to help determine the quantity of water required in  a watershed to protect ecosystem health, and the quantity  of water available to be allocated for human use.   Where developed, these plans have improved the  efficiency of making water allocation decisions while  protecting environmental flows. The plans have also  assisted government agencies and water licence  applicants as they ensure that their applications and  actions align with environmental laws.   The Shawnigan-Goldstream Water Allocation Plan  describes these plans as “a means of anticipating and  planning for water uses, identifying water demands and  ensuring that water use is compatible with the goals of a  sustainable environment.   Advantages of Water Allocation Plans include:   ▪  The provincial government’s position on water allocation  decisions is available to applicants and the public;  ▪  Response time for a water license application   is reduced;  ▪  The need for individual studies and reports on   each water licence application is eliminated;  ▪  Decisions are made more consistently, and   allocation directions are defined; and,  ▪  There is no need for referrals on individual water   license applications.”    As of March 2011, 23 WAPs have been completed and  three water management plans have been developed  for watersheds on Vancouver and the Gulf Islands.  One water availability study (to inform water allocation  decisions) has also been completed for a water source   in the Southern Interior. To view a list or to access the plans, visit   www.env.gov.bc.ca/wsd/water_rights/wap/index.html.   To date, all Water Allocation Plans have been prepared for surface  water resources. As with water use plans, WAPs are unlikely to be  applicable to groundwater resources because of the complexity of  groundwater resources and because the Water Act does not presently  require a licence to withdraw and use subsurface water. Therefore,  Water Allocation Plans may be an inappropriate or impractical  approach to planning for groundwater resources. However, some of  the characteristics and benefits of Water Allocation Plans, such as  area-based planning and consideration of future water demand, can  be adapted to plan for and manage the allocation of groundwater  resources. In addition, groundwater regulation is within the scope of   the Water Act Modernization initiative.  Key Elements and Steps  The following are some of the key elements and steps in preparing a  Water Allocation Plan:   ▪  Planning is initiated by the regional water manager (or equivalent) of  the ministry of forests, lands and natural resource operations;  ▪  The planning process is led by ministry staff when a business case  has been established that demonstrates efficiencies in making water  licence and allocation decisions;  ▪  Assessments are conducted on a watershed basis to identify the  available surface water resources, instream flow requirements for  fish, existing and potential licensable water demands, and to provide  direction regarding future water licence allocations;  ▪  Significant resources may be invested in gathering required water flow  information, undertaking assessments, and working with agencies and  stakeholders to develop the plan;   ▪ The WAP is submitted to the regional water manager for approval;  ▪  The WAP becomes regional policy upon signature by the regional  water manager; and  ▪  The WAP is reviewed when the regional water manager feels that it is  appropriate to update or amend the plan.  1  Brandes, O.M., 2005.

Protecting   drinking Water Quality  Drinking water in BC communities comes from a  variety of surface and groundwater sources.  There are diverse pressures and challenges to be considered when  planning and managing for drinking water quality. These include  a wide variety of point sources (e.g. wastewater discharges from  sewage treatment, commercial and industrial facilities) and non- point sources (e.g. runoff from urban development, agriculture,  forestry and other land uses) of pollution. Natural processes, such  as flooding, landslides, erosion and sediment transport can also  impact water quality with turbidity and water-borne pathogens  (such as E. coli, Cryptosporidium, and Giardia). It is also important  to consider the impacts of climate change when planning and  managing for drinking water in BC.  Healthy watersheds can contribute significantly to clean surface  and groundwater sources because healthy watersheds purify  water, and vegetated riparian areas filter and process pollutants  such as heavy metals, oils, sediment and waste products. Aquatic  ecosystems, such as wetlands and rivers, filter water, allow for  the deposition of suspended sediments and provide extra storage  capacity in times of high precipitation. Natural states of land  cover, such as forest ecosystems, also help to naturally manage  stormwater runoff and reduce flooding risks, and provide important  habitat for fish and wildlife. When the health and functionality of   a watershed is compromised by human intervention, changes to  water quality can occur and additional planning and management  may be needed.  The primary responsibilities for protecting water quality are shared by  all orders of government including federal (departments of Aboriginal  Affairs and Northern Development, Environment, and Fisheries and  Oceans), provincial (ministries of Health and Environment), regional  health authorities, First Nations, municipalities, regional districts,  other water suppliers. When you consider the variety of pressures on  water quality, we all have roles in the protection of water quality. The  roles and responsibilities for drinking water treatment vary across  the province, but lie primarily with municipalities, regional districts, or  other water suppliers, with oversight by the BC Ministry of Health and  Regional Health Authorities.  Types of Planning for Protecting Drinking Water Quality  This section of the guide profiles three specific types of plans:   ▪Well (Aquifer) Protection Plans  ▪Source Water Assessments and Assessment Response Plans  ▪Drinking Water Protection Plans  26    Three types of plans may be developed to assist with the protection of  water quality in British Columbia. Drinking Water Protection Plans are  established under the provincial Drinking Water Protection Act by the  government to prevent a substantial threat to water supplies that would  result in a health hazard. Also under the Drinking Water Protection Act, an  Assessment Response Plan can be required if a Drinking Water Officer,  orders a water supplier to prepare an assessment where potential threats  to water quality have been identified, that might adversely impact water  supply. Well Protection Plans, which may also be a requirement under the  Drinking Water Protection Act, are developed to minimize impacts of land  use activities on groundwater supplies that are used by community wells.  Well Protection Plans can be expanded to the protection of entire aquifers,  or perhaps multiple aquifers. For this reason, these plans are referred to as  Well (Aquifer) Protection Plans in this guide. Section 7 of the guide explores  the scope and value of water, watershed and storm water management  plans, which are also relevant to the protection of water quality.  Why Plan for Protecting Drinking Water Quality?  In anticipation of and/or response to mounting challenges, pressures  and changes in their watersheds, it is important for BC communities to  plan for protection of their drinking water. Water planning can help BC  communities understand and address current and expected challenges  by improving knowledge about threats to water quality. Protecting source  water and drinking water quality is primarily about ensuring that point  and non-point sources of pollution do not adversely impact water for  human consumption. Source water includes surface waters, aquifers, or  groundwater recharge areas.   For an overview of roles and responsibilities for the protection of drinking water  quality see the Ministry of Health website for Drinking Water Quality.  Considerable time, money and effort go into treating water and wastewater  to protect water quality for various uses. Recently, attention has turned to  the importance of protecting water sources as a fundamental approach to  managing water quality. Source water protection seeks to identify means of  preventing, minimizing, or controlling potential sources of water pollution. It is  the first step in a multi-barrier approach to drinking water protection, which  provides benefits on a watershed scale by protecting public health, ecosystem  functions, and a variety of social, economic, cultural and spiritual values. Figure  2 illustrates different components of a multi-barrier approach to protecting  drinking water. For information on the multi-barrier approach see the Interior  Health Authority website on Drinking Water Source Protection and Multiple  Barriers of Drinking Water Health Protection.  127    In many cases other water uses, such as those related to agricultural, commercial, institutional  and industrial operations, are connected to drinking water supplies. In addition, there are many  ecological, recreational and other non-consumptive water uses that must be managed along with  drinking water supplies. Often, protecting drinking water can have important co-benefits related  to environmental, cultural, spiritual and aesthetic values.  Desired outcomes of water quality planning may include:   ▪  Ensuring a safe, secure supply of quality water for a wide variety of uses;  ▪  Ensuring that water supply is robust and resilient to climate change impacts and other factors;  ▪  Managing wastewater discharges to be within the capacity of receiving waters to absorb   and assimilate wastes;  ▪  Managing land and resource development practices (and day to day human activities)   in ways that maintain and protect water quality;   ▪  Practicing urban and rural development in ways that do not adversely affect natural   processes (e.g. Leaving floodplains in natural states and promoting natural functions   such as sediment transport); and  ▪  Raising public awareness of the value and importance of fresh water.  Because these planning processes consider threats to water quality, they present opportunities  to consider the impacts of climate change along with other pressures on water quality.  Community Watersheds (CWs) are another potential watershed planning unit for consideration  in some areas. The province has established 467 CWs in response to the Forest and Range  Practices Act, (Government Action Regulation) which provides an added level of protection for  water quality in association with forestry operations. However, more research may be required to  determine whether there are CWs with completed watershed plans, or there is a desire, capacity  and benefits associated with watershed planning at this scale.  Figure 2. Components of a Multi-barrier Approach to Drinking Water Protection. 1  28  Legislature   & policy    frameworks  Source   water   protection  Drinking   water    treatment  Drinking water   distribution system  Clean, safe, reliable  drinking water  Guidelines,  standards &  objectives  Public involvement &  awareness  Research, science  & technology    M ON  IT O  RI NG  M ANAGEM  ENT    Challenges and Pressures  Water quality is a significant issue in some  communities, particularly where there are threats  to, or pressures on, community water supplies.  In some regions in BC drinking water treatment  capacity is limited due to supply issues, and the  health of aquatic ecosystems is threatened by  point or non-point sources of pollution.  For some local governments meeting provincial  drinking water standards is a challenge. All BC  Health Authorities are required to meet or exceed  the Guidelines for Canadian Drinking Water  Quality. The Vancouver Island Health Authority  developed its own interpretation of the guidelines  with the introduction of the 4-3-2-1 Initiative. This  initiative is now used by Health Authorities across  BC to ensure compliance. In some communities,  compliance with the guidelines will require the  installation of new treatment plants, which  can be a considerable added cost. Because  the pressures on water quality are so diverse,  ultimately it is everyone’s responsibility to take  care of our water resources, including protection  of water quality at the source.  Boil Water Advisories  Boil water advisories are issued to residents  and other water users when a drinking water  source is contaminated or there is a known  risk of contamination. Advisories consider the  water source, water quality, and distribution  and filtration processes. Therefore, the number  of boil water advisories issued reflects both the  quality of drinking water sources in the area and  the adequacy of treatment systems to provide  clean water. Over the past decade, the number  of boil water advisories in BC has increased. This  may be due to several reasons related to actual  deterioration of water quality, or greater focus on  monitoring and attention to risk. In 2008, the BC  Ministry of Health documented 530 boil water  advisories. Most of those advisories were on  smaller water systems that were serving between  15 and 5000 people. 2   Land Use and Non-Point   Sources of Pollution   Urban, industrial and agricultural activities can pose  serious threats to water quality. These land uses  are associated with a variety of pollutants including  nitrates from manure and synthetic fertilizers  applied to agricultural lands, sedimentation from  eroding soils and stream banks through urban  development, and toxic chemicals from a variety  of industrial, commercial and household sources.  Development activities near shallow wells or above  unconfined aquifers (e.g. aquifers that do not have  an impermeable layer above them to protect the  water from surface pollutants), increase the risk of  contamination, and are of particular concern.   Vulnerable Aquifers  Presently, no permits are required to drill a well or  extract well water in BC. This lack of groundwater  regulation is a key challenge; however, this may   change with modernization of the Water Act. Drinking water quality concerns may be elevated  in communities that rely primarily on groundwater sources. This is because groundwater  sources are difficult to clean once contaminated, contamination can more easily occur  without anyone knowing about it, and because they require more time for natural recycling  and replacement of water than do surface water sources. Therefore, once water quality is  degraded, it takes much longer for contaminants to be diluted or removed. This is a concern  to communities such as Langley BC, which sources 80% of its drinking water from wells.  Source Protection and Upstream Activities  In many cases, resource-related activities on private and Crown lands, such as forestry,  ranching, agriculture and mining, can effect nearby or downstream community water  supplies. Often these activities take place “upstream” of community water supplies,  and may be outside of the jurisdiction of local or regional governments. Typically, local  governments do not have the authority to regulate or stop these resource practices. There  is also a limitation of government authority when it comes to agriculture even within local  government boundaries. For example, farm bylaws require approval by the Province of BC  before coming into effect.  Climate Considerations  Climate change is impacting, and will continue to impact, water quality through a variety of  mechanisms throughout BC. Increased frequency and severity of drought and flood events,  low summer flows, warmer freshwater temperatures, reduced dilution / assimilative capacity,  and increased erosion, turbidity and sedimentation are just a few examples. These and  other climate-related impacts should be addressed in plans that consider medium to long- term pressures on water quality. The plans should develop solutions for dealing with those  pressures. See sections 3 and 9 of this guide for information, tools and resources about  climate change impacts on water, related community vulnerabilities and risks, as well as  considerations about how climate impacts can be managed through water and watershed  planning as well as adaptation.   6.1 Well (AQuifeR) PROteCtiOn PlAns  Well Protection Plans can be developed to provide protective measures for minimizing and  preventing undesirable impacts from land use activities on subsurface community water  sources. Many wells that provide water to communities or municipalities are located in areas  where human activities can affect water quality. The impact is most severe where these  “community wells” draw water from shallow aquifers that are vulnerable to contamination  from land use activities and non-point sources of pollution. Protecting source water through  a well protection plan is one of the steps in the multi-barrier approach to drinking water  protection. Approximately 40 Well Protection Plans have been established in BC. The  Ministry of Environment is the lead agency for the Well Protection Toolkit.  Characteristics, Benefits and Applications  Well or aquifer protection plans focus on protecting groundwater quality from potential  pollution sources. These sources of pollution may come from the land above or near to the  aquifer or well, or they may infiltrate into the groundwater source from elsewhere. These  plans examine water quality threats from a variety of sources, including residential, industrial,  commercial, institutional and agricultural land uses as well as natural resource development.  Aquifer-wide plans are more likely to be effective and deliver water quality benefits than  a plan that is focused on an individual well without looking at the broader connections of  multiple wells and pollution sources across an entire aquifer.  In BC, Well Protection Plans may be required under the following circumstances:   ▪  By health authorities when they review an operating permit for a large drinking   water system that includes wells;  ▪  By the provincial government as a condition of granting infrastructure funding for   new municipal/regional district wells; and,  ▪  As a condition of a provincial environmental assessment for proposed large withdrawals.3   Well protection plans are developed for an area that includes the recharge area for a well or  aquifer. It is important to consider all land uses and associated threats to groundwater quality.  Therefore, the use of a holistic approach to planning is encouraged. A more holistic approach  may aim to address multiple aquifers within a region or community and it may also aim to  address both quality and quantity issues. Depending on the water and land use pressures,  and water-related vulnerabilities, a more comprehensive Groundwater Management Plan may  be appropriate in some areas.   29    Key Elements and Steps  In partnership with the BC Ground Water Association, the Province of BC published  the Well Protection Toolkit, which was updated in 2006. Over the last five years,  communities in BC have been using the toolkit to develop protection plans for their  wells and aquifers, and to prevent contamination of their groundwater supply. The  toolkit presents a six-step approach to developing and implementing a protection plan  to prevent well water contamination. The six steps, briefly summarized, are as follows:    1. Form a community planning team; 2.  Define the capture zone (recharge area) of the community well or aquifer; 3.  Map potential sources of pollution in the capture zone; 4.  Develop and implement protection measures to prevent pollution; 5.  Develop a contingency plan for any accidents; and  6.  Monitor, evaluate and report on the plan annually.  These six steps can be incorporated as a policy commitment into Official Community  Plans or as part of Water Management Plans.4 However, there is some uncertainty  about the authority of local governments to invoke the protection measures referred to  above, as well as the resource capacity to enforce these protection measures.  6.2 sOuRCe WAteR Assessments & Assessment ResPOnse PlAns  Drinking water source and system assessments are a critical starting point for drinking  water protection, and are integral to understanding the state of BC’s drinking water  supplies, and what needs to be done to improve them. Water providers often do not  have any control over land uses in the watersheds from which they get their drinking  water. They may not be aware of natural conditions or human activities within a  watershed that affect surface and subsurface water quality. Proper assessments can  help identify opportunities for preventative or remedial action, and give both the water  providers and their customers confidence that source protection is a management  priority in the region.   Under Part 3 of the Drinking Water Protection Act, a drinking water protection officer  may order a water supplier to complete a water source and system assessment.          The purpose of the assessment is to:   ▪  Assess the drinking water source in relation to land uses within the   watershed and activities that may affect the source;  ▪  Inventory the water supply system, including treatment options and   operational procedures;  ▪  Assess the monitoring requirements for the drinking water source and   water supply system; and;  ▪  Identify current and potential future threats to drinking water.   The Ministry of Health has produced both the Source to Tap Screening Tool, which  can be used to used as a secondary method for assessing risk in drinking water  systems, and the Comprehensive Drinking Water Source-to-Tap Assessment  Guideline, which serves as a tool to help water system managers develop a better  understanding of the risks to drinking water safety and availability. The guideline  provides a structured and consistent approach to evaluating and managing risks to  drinking water. The outcomes of a Source Water Assessment determine whether or  not an Assessment Response Plan is required. 6  Characteristics, Benefits and Applications  After reviewing a completed source and system assessment, a drinking water protection  officer may order a water supplier to complete an Assessment Response Plan, as outlined  under Section 22 of the Drinking Water Protection Act. These plans are intended to identify  measures that can be taken to address identified threats to drinking water.   Currently, the regulations do not state when source water assessments will be  required; however, the Drinking Water Officer’s Guide outlines some of the conditions  under which an assessment may be required. It is not yet clear what role, if any, the  public will have in this process.   Key Elements and Steps  Assessment Response Plans are intended to  identify reasonable measures that can be taken  to address threats to drinking water, as identified  in a Source Water Assessment. Some of the  provisions that a drinking water protection officer  may ask to be addressed in the plan include:    ▪  Increasing public engagement and   awareness to encourage the protection of  drinking water sources;  ▪  The preparation of guides relating to best  management and conservation practices;  ▪Minor or major infrastructure improvements;  ▪  The initiation of cooperative planning and/ or voluntary programs related to water  conservation; and  ▪  Recommendations regarding local authority  zoning and/or land use regulations.1  6.3 dRinkinG WAteR   PROteCtiOn PlAns  Drinking Water Protection Plans (DWPPs) are  designed to protect water quality and quantity  from a wide range of pressures. The plans are  typically developed for a specific source of  drinking water supply, such as a watercourse,  watershed, reservoir or aquifer. Therefore, they  are relevant to area-based planning for both  surface water (watersheds) and groundwater  (aquifers), where the threats to water quality and  quantity are dispersed across a wide landscape.  Within these plans, it is important to consider all  potential threats to the water source; therefore, a  watershed-based approach – at the appropriate  scale – is particularly relevant.   As of 2011, no DWPPs had been completed  or designated in BC. They are considered  to be a last resort because of the stringent  requirements associated with them, and should  only be considered where it can be established  that regulatory tools are required to achieve  the planning objectives. DWPPs should only  be required when other plans fail to address or  prevent a threat to drinking water. However, there  are circumstances where threats to drinking water  could lead to negative consequences (such as a  health hazard) where no other measures under the  Drinking Water Protection Act would prevent the  health hazard from occurring.  Characteristics, Benefits and Applications  DWPPs are authorized under Part 5 of the  Drinking Water Protection Act and are intended  to address concerns about water quantity and  water quality. Based on the recommendation of  a drinking water protection officer, the Provincial  Health Officer may recommend that the Minister  of Health designate an area for a DWPP.

Delegating Water Governance: Issues and Challenges in the BC Context.   A paper for the BC Water Governance Project. Vancouver, BC: UBC Program on Water Governance.   water protection officers are required to consider all other options  available under the Drinking Water Protection Act before asking the  Provincial Health Officer to consider recommending a plan. To date,  no plans have been completed. However, the creation of a Drinking  Water Protection Plan has been under consideration for the Comox  Valley on Vancouver Island for the past two years. For such plans to be  authorized, there would have to be significant impairments to source  waters, and an associated health hazard to trigger a planning effort.   Because they are fairly comprehensive, DWPPs have the potential to be  very powerful and effective. They can consider threats to water sources,  different methods of treatment, and all matters related to the delivery of safe  drinking water. DWPPs are similar in scope to Water Management Plans,  which are established under Part 4 of the Water Act (see Section 7 in this  guide). Because there is potential for the two types of plans to overlap, the  Drinking Water Protection Act and Water Act state that if both types are to  be initiated within one particular area, they can be developed jointly. 3  Key Elements and Steps  Drinking Water Protection Plans are issued by the provincial government  (the Lieutenant Governor with advice from Cabinet) to do one   or more of the following:  a)    Require other specified provincial government or local authority  strategic or operational planning processes, or classes   of such processes, to consider the DWPP;  b)   Require the results of specified provincial government or local  authority strategic or operational planning processes,   or classes of such processes, to be consistent with the DWPP;  c)    Provide that specified provincial government or local authority  strategic or operational plans, bylaws, or other planning documents,  or classes of such plans, bylaws, or other documents do not have  legal effect to the extent of any inconsistency with the DWPP; and  d)    A provision under subsection (1) c) applies despite any other enactment.  6.4 RefeRenCes  31   Some of the key elements and steps in preparing a Drinking Water  Protection Plan are as follows:   ▪  A Provincial Health Officer triggers initiation of the plan, and the plan   is customized to address the specific water health hazard identified   by the Officer;  ▪  The plans are initiated, and have their terms of reference established  by an order issued by the Minister of Health;  ▪  The plans are required to consider existing provincial or local  government planning processes. These may include strategic,  operational, land use or water use plans;  ▪  Preparation of the plans must include an extensive public   consultation process;  ▪  The plans are subject to review by the provincial Cabinet and approval  by an order of the provincial Cabinet;  ▪  Water suppliers are legally responsible for putting the plans into action; and  ▪  They are implemented through regulatory actions, which are   legally enforceable.    7. integrating Water,   land & Watersheds There are many diverse pressures and challenges  on water resources and watersheds in BC.  In this section, we examine the full spectrum of water and watershed issues  and explore the value of adopting an integrated approach to planning and  management. The context for integrated planning includes the breadth  of issues that were raised in sections 5 (water supply and demand) and  6 (protecting drinking water quality). In addition, integrated watershed  planning considers issues related to watershed functions, ecosystem  health, connections between land use and water, as well as water quality  within lakes, rivers and streams.   The challenges and pressures associated with watershed health include  population growth, community and economic development, and a wide  variety of point and non-point sources of pollution. It is also becoming  increasingly important to consider the impacts of climate change when  developing planning processes, implementing those plans and making  water management decisions.  As noted in section 6, healthy watersheds, riparian areas, wetlands,  floodplains and natural land covers such as forests provide important  habitat for fish and wildlife, help to filter and process pollutants, slow  water down, reducing stormwater runoff and flooding while allowing for  the deposition of suspended sediments. When the natural functioning of a  watershed is compromised by human activities, integrated approaches to  water and watershed planning can be helpful, and may well be necessary.   The responsibilities for protecting watershed health and the  interconnections between water quantity and quality are widely distributed  among federal, provincial, First Nations, and local governments, and other  organizations. In many BC communities, the challenge of navigating highly  complex water and land use issues is pointing to the need for an integrated  and collaborative approach to watershed planning and governance.  Integrated planning involves a broad-based analysis of local and regional  water quantity, water quality and other watershed issues, as well as the  interconnections between these issues.   ▪Water Management Plans (Water Act, Part 4)  ▪Watershed Management Plans  ▪Stormwater (Rainwater) Management Plans  Types of Integrated Water & Watershed Planning  The following planning processes encourage more integrated and holistic  approaches and can help to address a variety of water supply, demand,  and quality issues, and include:   32    Why Undertake Integrated Planning   for Water, Land and Watersheds  BC communities are undertaking integrated  watershed planning and are adopting a wide  range of strategies to manage a multitude of  current and future challenges, pressures and  changes in watersheds. Many of these pressures  may be effectively addressed within plans that  recognize the interconnections within a watershed  system, including:   ▪ surface water and groundwater connections;  ▪water quantity and quality connections;  ▪ land and water connections; and  ▪ community and watershed connections.  Watershed planning can help BC communities  understand and address these challenges by  improving knowledge about the current and future  threats to water quantity and quality for human  and environmental uses, and threats to overall  watershed health and community sustainability.  The desired outcomes of integrated planning for  water, land and watersheds may include:   ▪  Managing water uses and rates of consumption  within available water supplies seasonally,  annually and over the long term;   ▪  Developing and managing water supplies in ways  that do not compromise the health and biodiversity  of fish, wildlife, ecosystems and watersheds;   ▪  Managing the allocation of water in ways  that support a variety of high-value water  uses, including human consumptive and  non-consumptive uses as well as instream  environmental uses;   ▪  Ensuring a safe, secure supply of water for a  wide variety of uses;   ▪  Managing wastewater discharges within the  capacity of receiving waters to absorb and  assimilate those wastes;   ▪  Managing land development and resource  management practices (and day to day human  activities) in ways that do not adversely impact  water quality;   ▪  Managing human development patterns in  ways that stabilize rather than destabilize the  hydrologic cycle;   ▪  Managing human development patterns in ways  that reduce rather than increase the vulnerability  of communities to water-related hazards, such  as flooding and erosion; and,   ▪  Maintaining and strengthening community  resiliency by preparing for climate change and its  impacts on water and aquatic ecosystems.  Challenges and Pressures  Integrated water and watershed planning is  important in communities, particularly where  there are multiple threats to, or pressures  on, the quantity and/or quality of community  water supplies, where infrastructure capacity   is limited in relation to those threats, and where the health of  aquatic ecosystems is threatened by multiple pressures on water  quality or quantity. Depending on the community or region of the  province, and on land and resource uses, climate change impacts  and planning can influence these issues in a variety of ways. The  following are a few examples of the challenges experienced in  communities across BC where integrated approaches to planning  may beneficial or necessary.  Growing Demands on Limited Water Supplies  A variety of land and water uses can impact water supply and  demand, stream hydrology, groundwater tables, surface and  groundwater quality, and the overall health of watersheds. For  example, in the Township of Langley, multiple community wells  and private wells withdraw water from the same aquifer. Managing  demand within the available supply requires an integrated approach  to understand the complexity of the challenges associated with water  use and groundwater recharge, particularly in relation to population  growth, economic development and climate change impacts.  Changes in Land Use and Land Cover  In many communities across BC, changes in land cover due to  activities such as forestry, and increased imperviousness as a result  of urban development can result in more “flashy” stream and river  hydrology and increased rates of erosion and sediment transport.  For example, in watersheds with reduced forest cover or increased  impervious surfaces, a greater proportion of rainfall quickly enters  storm sewers, drainage ditches and streams, resulting in high  peak flows and less groundwater infiltration. In the Central Interior  of BC, the mountain pine beetle (MPB) outbreak has resulted in  many dead, standing trees, significant salvage logging, and forest  fires, all of which have dramatically impacted hydrology, erosion  and sedimentation, aquatic habitat, and overall watershed health.  Many see the MPB outbreak as being caused or exacerbated  by climate change because average winter temperatures have  warmed. Historically, cold winters have kept mountain pine beetle  populations in check in BC, thereby preventing a significant  outbreak. Over the long term, forest cover may return to more  natural conditions and watershed health may recover; however,  in the interim, communities may need to manage the impacts  associated with these pressures. In the case of urban development,  human intervention may be required to restore watershed health.  With respect to the effects of BC’s MPB infestation on hydrology  note the 2008 Ministry of Environment report: Mountain Pine Beetle  Infestation: Hydrological Impacts.  Climate Considerations   Climate change is impacting, and will continue to impact, many  aspects of water, land and watersheds in BC. Some of the most  significant impacts on watersheds expected from climate change  include reduced annual and/or seasonal precipitation, reduced  snowpack, loss of glaciers, changing surface and groundwater  hydrology, increased frequency and severity of drought and  flood events, low summer flows, warm freshwater temperatures,  reduced dilution / assimilative capacity of receiving waters, and  increased erosion, turbidity and sedimentation. These and other  climate-related impacts should be addressed in plans that aim to  consider medium to long-term pressures on water quantity, quality,  and ecosystem health. The plans should develop solutions for  dealing with those pressures. See sections 3 and 9 of this guide  for information, tools and resources about climate change impacts  on water, related community vulnerabilities and risks, as well as   33    considerations about how climate impacts can  be managed through adaptation and water and  watershed planning.  The need for a watershed approach is made  even more evident when compounded by current  and expected impacts of climate change. For  example, the Okanagan, Thompson and Cariboo- Chilcotin regions can expect hotter, drier summers;  extended growing seasons with the potential for  new crop production; and increased demand for  irrigation and livestock watering. Because this will  occur when stream flows are at their lowest and  when fish are particularly vulnerable, this may lead  to increased levels of conflict among water users.   Because all three planning processes profiled  in this section (water management, watershed  management and stormwater management) may  consider existing and future watershed processes  and functions, they provide opportunities to  consider climate change and its impacts, as well  as other pressures, on watershed health. It should  be noted that although this guide focuses on  planning and climate change adaptation for water  and watersheds, climate change impacts will  undoubtedly have a variety of other impacts on  terrestrial ecosystems such as forests, grasslands  and alpine ecosystems. These impacts on the  landscape will, in turn, influence the health of  watersheds. However, these land-based climate  impacts are beyond the scope of this guide.  7.1 WAteR mAnAGement PlAns  (WAteR ACt – PARt 4)  Water Management Plans, which were  introduced under Part 4 of the Water Act in  2004, involve a comprehensive and integrated  approach to water and watershed planning.  This planning process is enabled only if the  Minister of Environment determines that such  a plan will help resolve conflicts between water  users, conflicts between users and instream flow  needs, or risks to water quality.   Although the Township of Langley has completed  the draft of a WMP, to date there are no approved  WMPs in effect in British Columbia. Therefore,  the operational compatibility of this planning tool  with other Acts and regulations cannot be fully  determined, nor can its effectiveness in improving  water quality. However, it has been suggested  that Water Management Plans hold potential  as a mechanism for protecting groundwater, as  well as for establishing authority for source water  protection. Unlike other water planning tools, when  Water Management Plans are implemented, they  can place restrictions on the drilling or alteration  of groundwater wells and the installation of well  pumps. The plans may also affect other statutory  decisions. However, there may be exceptions  where the application of a WMP could be limited  such as the Forest Act, Range Act, Forest  Practices Code of BC Act, and the Forest and  Range Practices Act. 1, 2     Water Management Plans may provide a good  structure for developing valley-wide response plans   for severe water shortages because they provide more authority to bring water licence holders  to the table and hold them to the agreements that have been developed. The plans may also  be useful for providing water managers with tools to reduce activities and development in  watersheds, thereby addressing the common challenge of managing water resources on private  as well as Crown lands. In 2009, the Township of Langley submitted a Water Management  Plan: Final Report to the Minister of Environment for review. As of 2011, TOL is the only local  government that has been designated by the Minister of Environment to do so. 2  Characteristics, Benefits and Applications  Water Management Plans are applicable to both water quantity and quality issues. In this  regard, they are relevant for source water protection and for managing demand in relation to  water supply. They may also be relevant to both surface water and groundwater sources.   Water Management Plans are also relevant for area-based planning. They apply to a  designated water management plan area where the water interests are dispersed across  a wide landscape and where many water licensees, groundwater users and land-based  activities may be included in the plan. A Water Management Plan could apply to a watershed,  aquifer, or another regional scale that is relevant to managing the water resources of a  particular community.  Water Management Plans should be considered where regulatory tools are required and will  provide an opportunity to achieve the planning objectives. Upon completion and approval by  the provincial Cabinet, Water Management Plans are legally enforceable. However, significant  resources may be required to develop and implement this type of plan. Therefore, this  approach to planning may not be feasible for some communities.  Water Management Plans are similar in scope to Drinking Water Protection Plans, which are  established under Part 5 of the Drinking Water Protection Act (see Section 6 in this guide).  Because there is potential for the two types of plans to overlap, the Drinking Water Protection  Act and Water Act state that if both types are to be initiated within one particular area, they  can be developed jointly.  Key Elements and Steps  The following are some of the key elements and steps in preparing a Water Management Plan:   ▪  The plans are requested by letter to the regional water manager or to the   comptroller of water rights;  ▪  The plans require an assessment of preparedness among stakeholders, first nations   and the province;  ▪  The plans are initiated & have their terms of reference established by an order of the minister;  ▪  The plans are required to consider existing provincial or local government strategic,  operational, and land use or water use planning processes;  ▪ Preparation of the plans must include an extensive public consultation process;  ▪  Consideration must be given to the results or progress of provincial or local government  strategic, operational and land use or water use planning processes within the  designated area;  ▪ The plans require approval by an order from the provincial cabinet to acquire official status;  ▪  The plans are brought into effect by the creation of a regulation that is designed to implement  the plan, approved by the provincial government by the lieutenant governor with advice from  cabinet; and,  ▪  The plans are implemented through regulation (the plan implementation regulation)   issued by the lieutenant governor in council.  7.2 WAteRshed mAnAGement PlAns  A watershed planning approach is a flexible framework for managing water resource quality  and quantity within a specific drainage area, or watershed. The approach includes stakeholder  involvement and management actions that are supported by sound science and technology.  The watershed planning process works within this framework by drawing on a series of  collaborative, iterative steps to characterize existing conditions, identify and prioritize problems,  define management objectives, develop protection or remediation strategies, and implement  and adapt selected actions when necessary. The outcome of this process is a watershed plan,  which is a strategy that assesses the state of a watershed and presents detailed management  information in terms of analyses, actions, participants and resources required for developing  and implementing the plan. Using a watershed approach is considered beneficial because it  addresses problems within a watershed in a holistic manner and actively involves stakeholders in  identifying management strategies.  34    BC has no formal requirements or stipulations  for undertaking watershed planning processes  beyond the provisions under the Water Act  to develop a WMP, with approval from the  provincial government. There is no standard  template to follow. Nonetheless, many  communities across the province have  taken the initiative to complete watershed  management plans by developing their own  approach to address key concerns in their  respective watersheds.  Characteristics, Benefits and Applications  Every watershed is unique in terms of its  features, and every watershed planning  process is unique in terms of the issues being  addressed and the people involved. Across  the province, watershed management plans  take different names and different forms,  including watershed strategies, watershed  blueprints, watershed recovery plans and  water use management plans. Despite these  differences, several traits are shared by most  watershed planning processes. Typically,  watershed planning is:   ▪ An iterative and adaptive process;  ▪ A holistic process;  ▪Geographically defined;  ▪ Integrated with other planning processes; and  ▪ A collaborative and participatory process. 4  Conversations with local governments and BC  communities suggest that many critical factors  work together to enable a watershed-based  approach to planning. These include:   ▪  A burning issue within the watershed that  demands attention (e.G., Water health issue,  community conflict);  ▪  An awareness and recognition of the   importance of watersheds  ▪  An understanding of a variety of planning issues;  ▪  A political will that aligns with staff capacity   and commitment;  ▪  A willingness to work with neighbouring  municipalities in shared watersheds  (where appropriate);  ▪  A designated body to coordinate the   effort (e.G., Regional district, okanagan   basin water board), with funding from  participating municipalities;  ▪  A strong stewardship ethic within the  community; and  ▪  A watershed that is at a scale that is   practical and reasonable to work with.  Key Elements and Steps  There is no absolute template to follow for  watershed planning. Every planning process  and every plan is different. However, many  elements are critical to the success of  watershed plans. Recommended guidelines  for watershed planning processes include   the following:     ▪  Develop a clear vision, goals, objectives   and action items;  ▪  Seek political endorsement. The relevant  decision makers must be willing to consider  implementing the plan;  ▪  Ensure full representation of all affected  parties, while keeping the size of the   process workable;  ▪  Ensure that the planning process is  understood, used and broadly supported;  ▪  Provide access to appropriate technical and  analytical skills and information resources;  ▪Obtain sustainable funding;  ▪  Ensure planning is done before further  development activities (e.g. urban  development) will undermine the  effectiveness of the plan;  ▪  Factor in the impacts on future water inflows  and recharge of climate change and activities  and physical works that intercept water (e.g.,  farm dams and forestry);  ▪  Include inputs from socio-economic analyses  and incorporate consultation to improve the  quality of decisions and build community  confidence in the fairness of outcomes;  ▪ Ensure that the values and interests of   indigenous peoples are considered;  Figure 3. Diagram of the   Watershed Planning Process.4  35   ▪  Evelop capacity for learning and improving plans  over time and the ability to evaluate the process;  ▪  Provide adequate resources to develop and  implement water plans and evaluate their  outcomes; and,  ▪  Improve monitoring and compliance   of water use.   Ideally, watershed plans and the organizations  involved in implementing the plans should  emerge from the planning process with:   ▪  improved understanding of the watershed  and how it functions;  ▪  clear objectives of how to manage   the watershed sustainably and in an  integrated manner;  ▪  clearly specified community and  environmental outcomes;  ▪  decisions that are based on the best  available information;  ▪  adequately resourced management and  implementation; and  ▪  good integration with other regional and  resource-based plans.5  It should be acknowledged that many of these  elements, steps and outcomes could also  support or strengthen any and all of the other  planning processes profiled within this guide.  Because of the complexity of watersheds,  including the diversity of interconnections  and dynamic change over time, an iterative  process is recommended for watershed  management planning. The following figure  from the U.S. Environmental Protection  Agency illustrates this (Figure 3).           D  evelo p Plan   Makes Changes    Mak  e Changes              E valuate plan     Im plem  ent plan    Im plem  ent plan             E valuate plan    7.3 stORmWAteR (RAinWAteR)  mAnAGement PlAns  Another important aspect of water and watershed  planning is the management of rainwater or  stormwater. All communities in BC are subject  to rainfall events and need to provide adequate  drainage to prevent localized flooding. It is widely  recognized that urban development can increase  impervious surfaces, impacting the hydrology of  local streams. Rural resource activities such as  forestry can also influence land cover, and thus  impact, hydrology.  Projections of increased stormwater runoff as a  result of climate change and urban development  have led some municipalities to seek additional  funds for infrastructure upgrades, while other  communities are examining alternative approaches  to managing rainwater. In addition to, or instead  of, building bigger pipes, ditches and pumps  to convey water from bigger storms, some  communities are taking the approach of “store it,  spread it, and sink it”. Rainwater and stormwater  can be viewed as a valuable resource that can  be stored in wetlands and detention ponds and  infiltrated into the ground to recharge water tables.  This can reduce or avoid many of the economic  and environmental costs associated with the  traditional model of conveying rainwater as quickly  as possible from roads, rooftops and parking lots  into storm sewers, drainage ditches and streams.  Urban stormwater runoff can adversely impact  stream hydrology, fish habitat and watershed  health by eroding stream banks, by causing water  turbidity and siltation of spawning and rearing  habitat, and by introducing other pollutants, such  as oil from roads, into the system.  Under the Local Government Act, municipalities  are responsible for the provision of drainage,  and in some cases, Regional Districts may  also have associated responsibilities. How we  handle stormwater has a huge impact on aquatic  ecosystems. Integrated stormwater management  planning is a proactive process that utilizes land  use planning tools to protect property and aquatic  habitat from stormwater flows, while at the same  time accommodating urban growth. Ideally, the aim  of these plans is to ensure that stormwater runoff  resembles natural runoff patterns (i.e., volume  and timing of surface water runoff), and does not  transport pollutants or sediment from the land into  watercourses. Stormwater management plans are  typically completed at the local government level,  with guidance from the Province. 5  BC’s Stormwater Planning Guidebook,   released in 2002, is premised on the idea that  land development and watershed protection   can be compatible. It assumes that municipalities  exert control over runoff volume through their   land development and infrastructure policies,  practices and actions.   Integrated Stormwater Management Plans  (ISMPs) are required to be developed and  implemented by Metro Vancouver’s member  municipalities in accordance with the Integrated   Liquid Waste and Resource Management Plan. To help facilitate  this, Metro Vancouver developed a comprehensive ISMP  Template (consistent with the provincial guide) to guide member  municipalities with this process. The updated LWMP is pending  approval from the Minister of Environment.  Outdated approaches to stormwater management, which fail to  respect natural systems and water cycles, have been accused  of being one of the largest water pollution challenges in the  province. In recent years, rainwater management has emerged  as a new way of thinking about the precipitation that falls on the  land. Instead of viewing stormwater as a site-specific problem  that is best solved by piping water away from properties into  streams, rainwater management considers the dynamics of  the entire watershed and identifies how development can use  “green infrastructure” to maintain natural systems and protect  buildings. Green infrastructure is a concept that emphasizes  the importance of the natural environment in decisions about  land use planning. For example, the installation of permeable  pavements, rain gardens, bioretention ponds and constructed  wetlands help reduce the volume of runoff that enters sewer  systems and increase absorption. Instead of relying heavily on  pipes and concrete, green infrastructure takes advantage of the  natural absorption, storage, evaporation and filtration services  that nature provides. As opposed to the quick, high-impact  flush that comes with traditional approaches to stormwater  management, lower impact green development seeks to mimic  the natural water cycle by allowing water to infiltrate down  through the ground and slowly release into the watershed.   The release of Beyond the Guidebook: Context for Rainwater  Management and Green Infrastructure in British Columbia  in 2007 has helped shift the focus of traditional stormwater  management to the integrated, holistic approach that rainwater  management embodies.   Climate change—and in particular the potential for more  frequent and more intense extreme precipitation events—is  an important consideration in this type of planning. Urban  flooding is now the leading cause of home insurance claims  in Canada, and is a priority of the insurance industry. For  more details refer to Hazard Perceptions: Public Education  Can Help Snap Flooding, from the Institute for Catastrophic  Loss Reduction. There is limited science on which to base  projections for a specific location; however, some jurisdictions  have identified voluntary planning contingencies for extreme  precipitation based on the best science available. For example,  on Vancouver Island, the Capital Regional District has identified  a planning contingency of a 15% increase in frequency and  duration of winter storms for the next 100 years. These  contingencies should inform decisions about which stormwater  management techniques to adopt and what the management  goals should be in terms of rate of runoff.  Characteristics, Benefits and Applications  Under the Environmental Management Act (Municipal Sewer  Regulation), stormwater management planning is a formal  requirement of Liquid Waste Management Plans, which is one of  several mechanisms used by the Province to regulate stormwater  in BC. Although municipalities are generally not required to have  Liquid Waste Management Plans, they often opt to complete  such plans because the plans allow a suitable length of time to  develop and implement effective and affordable solutions.   The outcome of integrated stormwater planning includes regional  or watershed level objectives and priorities, integration of these  objectives into community planning, and implementation of on- site practices that reduce volume and rate of run-off and improve   36    water quality. Stormwater management plans need to be integrated with Official Community   Plans and zoning bylaws that regulate the location of development and density of use. 5  Some benefits of undertaking stormwater management planning and implementing   completed plans include:   ▪  Protection of the aquatic environment, including water quality and stream flow,   and protection from flooding;  ▪  Protection of community assets and infrastructure from localized flooding;  ▪  Protection of water supply (e.g., groundwater recharge areas);   ▪  Management of erosion and sedimentation processes; and  ▪  Protection of aesthetic values and recreational uses of water.  Key Elements and Steps  The Stormwater Planning Guidebook provides a detailed explanation of the various   stages of preparing a plan. It outlines three key steps and associated methods that   work towards integrated stormwater management solutions, and five guiding   principles to uphold in the process, as outlined below. They include the following:  Stormwater Planning Steps  1.  Identify at-risk catchments; 2.  Set preliminary performance targets; and, 3.   Select appropriate stormwater management site design solutions.  Guiding Principles of Integrated Stormwater Management (ADAPT)  1.  Agree that stormwater is a resource; 2.   Design for a complete spectrum of rainfall events; 3.  Act on a priority basis in at-risk catchments; 4.   Plan at four scales (regional, watershed, neighbourhood and site); and, 5.   Test solutions and reduce costs by adaptive management.  1   Watershed Watch Salmon Society et al (2009).

Several common themes emerged from the literature that was  reviewed during the preparation of this guide, from discussions  with project advisors, from interviews with practitioners and  community representatives and from research about water  and watershed planning initiatives. These recurring themes are  explored in this section and shared to help communities build a  broader understanding of the dynamics of watershed planning.  These are important considerations for any water or watershed  planning process and for any individual or organization involved   in planning processes.  The themes explored in this section of the Guide include:   ▪Re-thinking Watersheds and Planning  ▪Community Collaboration and Engagement  ▪Regional Approaches  ▪Resourcing Planning Initiatives   ▪ Information and Knowledge.  38    8.1 Re-thinkinG WAteRsheds And PlAnninG  “When we try to pick out anything by itself, we find it hitched to everything else in the universe”  – John Muir, Naturalist, Conservationist  Historically, the traditional approach to water management has been fragmented, not integrated to  reflect the connections within a watershed. Water quality and water quantity have been managed  separately, and decision making around water resources has been governed more by political  boundaries than by natural ones. More recently, however, watersheds have received renewed attention  as an important unit for planning, and there is wide acceptance that the management and planning  of water should occur at a watershed level. For example, at a national level, Canada’s Federal Water  Policy adopts watersheds as the preferred spatial unit for water resource planning.    An integrated approach to watershed planning considers the interactions between the biophysical,  constructed and human landscapes within a watershed (Figure 4). An integrated approach  recognizes the interdependencies in both natural and human systems, as detailed in the table below.     Integration in the Natural System Integration in the Human System  Between land and water use  Mainstreaming water in the national economy  Between surface water and groundwater  Ensuring coordination between sectors  Between water quantity and quality  Ensuring partnership between public and private sector management  Between upstream and downstream  Involving everybody  Between freshwater and coastal waters   Integrated watershed planning provides a means for coordinating decisions among government and  private agencies in order to resolve land use and resource management conflicts and issues. The  resolution of these issues is typically done through multi-stakeholder collaborative planning; through  monitoring, research and consultation; by negotiating consensus; and by ensuring accountability  through open communication, education and public access to information. Integrated watershed  planning combines scientific and technical information with cultural and social values to resolve  conflicts and identify a desirable future outcome.  Integrated watershed management is also  referred to in some regions as ecosystem-based  management. By this approach, “instead of  managing a watershed as an adjunct to the  water supply, maintaining healthy watersheds is  considered a prerequisite to water management;  water allocations are constrained by the larger  need to ensure that the natural processes are  maintained”.1 More recently, the terms “water  centric planning”, “design with nature”, and the  “soft path” approach have been used in BC to  discuss and promote the concepts embedded in  integrated watershed management. Water centric  planning is described next. See the web version  of this guide for information on design with nature  and the soft path approach.  39  Watershed  Integrated  Watershed   Management BuildingsHumans  Landscape  Figure 4 – Components of Integrated   Water and Watershed Management    8.1.2 WAteR CentRiC PlAnninG  Water centric planning refers to planning with a view  to water, on any scale. The underpinning premise  of water centric planning is that resource use, land  use and community design will be done with an eye  towards their potential impact on a watershed. This  approach puts water stewardship and sustainability  at the centre of land use, development, or resource  planning initiatives. Water centric decisions consider  the amount of water available, the amount of water  needed, the use of innovative efficiency strategies, the  quality of water leaving an area, how rain and snow  water are managed, and the impact of development  on the natural environment. As such, it requires  that missions, mandates and accountabilities of  participating agencies be ultimately integrated.   Water centric planning is founded upon an earlier  concept used in BC— the watershed landscape- based approach to planning. Water centric planning  can be used at the watershed, sub-watershed, or site  level. Its objectives include:   ▪  Protection of people and property from   natural hazards;  ▪  Preservation and conservation of   self-sustaining ecosystems;  ▪  Continuation and growth of resource-based  economic activity; and  ▪  Provision of an affordable, sustainable   and maintainable infrastructure.  Many policies and tools are available to local  governments to implement water centric   planning, including:    ▪  Regional conservation strategies that identify land  and water to be protected;  ▪  Official Community Plans that include development  permit areas around all types of watercourses and  associated habitats;  ▪  Liquid Waste Management Plans that have an  increased emphasis on non-point source pollution  and water;  ▪  Zoning bylaws that promote high-density  developments;  ▪Regional Growth Strategies;  ▪  Regulatory bylaws, such as watercourse protection  bylaws and subdivision bylaws;  ▪Watershed and Well (Aquifer) Protection Plans;  ▪  Tax incentives for land conservation, brownfield  development, infill and low-impact development;  ▪  Infrastructure funding directed to designated growth  areas; and,   ▪  Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design  (LEED) Green Building Rating System.   The water centric approach also builds on lessons  learned from past and recent practices related  to integrative planning and implementation  of planning decisions. It operates within the  context of existing regional and municipal  strategies, such as Regional Growth Strategies  and Official Community Plans. It can also involve  inter-municipal cooperation where watershed  boundaries cross local government boundaries. 3  The South Okanagan Regional District’s Regional Growth Strategy (RGS) was used as a  pilot for water centric action in BC. The policy clearly recognizes the relationship between  land and water, both in terms of water use and water runoff. A toolkit was developed to  accompany the RGS and to guide decision making on the ground in terms of how land  will be developed and water will be used, and to assist with benchmarking, monitoring and  measuring key objectives within the policy.     8.2 COmmunity COllAbORAtiOn And enGAGement  “The hope for achieving sustainability in water management lies in the establishment of  interdependent, community-based partnerships and increased stakeholder involvement.”    “Simply put, transformational change will result when decision-makers in government  collaborate with grass-root visionaries in the community to create a legacy”    The value of collaboration among, and engagement with, different orders of government,  different water use sectors, stewardship organizations, and the multitude of community  stakeholders is a recurring theme throughout this guide. Collaboration is often cited as  a key success factor in watershed planning. Basically everyone has a role to play, and a  responsibility to fulfill when it comes to the use, protection and sustainable management  of water resources and healthy watersheds. Specific benefits associated with community  engagement and collaboration include:   ▪  Stronger relationships between participants in terms of trust, respect, information sharing,  and improved negotiation;   ▪  More comprehensive and widely accepted land use decisions as a result of improved  communications, demonstrated commitment, and information sharing;  ▪  Greater likelihood of successful implementation of the plan as a result of the involvement of  all stakeholders, whose values and interests are reflected in the plan; and,   ▪  Greater accountability of all community members involved in the planning process with  regards to their own actions and behaviours in a watershed.   These benefits of collaboration are considered by many to be critical success factors for  effective planning and implementation.  The sections that follow identify some key aspects of collaboration in water and watershed  planning in BC. Recommendations for developing collaborative planning processes with local  governments in BC are provided, the importance of working with First Nations is discussed,  and suggestions for strengthening these critical relationships are profiled. Finally, some of the  concerns, challenges and barriers associated with collaborative planning are highlighted, along  with some of the opportunities or breakthroughs that BC communities have experienced when  navigating through these challenges.  Multiple Planning Partners of Local Governments in BC  A growing interest and willingness within BC communities to get involved in watershed  planning has emerged over the last two decades. Whether for site-specific issues or for  broader regional land use considerations, collaboration is becoming a preferred model of  decision making in many parts of the province. At the community level, a greater emphasis on  collaborative planning for watersheds has put local governments in touch with a wide range  of partners from different government organizations as well as representatives from both the  business and stewardship communities. The following are a few examples of the partners that  work with local governments in planning as well as some common roles these partners play.  This information is from 21 in-depth interviews with local government staff from across BC.  See also Section 4 of this guide for information on roles and responsibilities in water planning,  management and governance.   ▪  Federal Departments (Environment; Fisheries and Oceans; Health; Aboriginal Affairs and  Northern Development and others) – Regulatory and/or approval roles; infrastructure funding;  advisory roles; monitoring and reporting; research and educational roles.  ▪  Provincial Ministries (Environment; Health; Forests, Lands and Natural Resource Operations  and others) – Regulatory and/or approval roles; water licenses and allocation; infrastructure  funding and planning grants; advisory roles; monitoring and reporting; research and  educational roles.  ▪  First Nations, Municipalities and Regional Districts – Provision of water services and  related infrastructure and/or service agreements (drinking water, wastewater treatment,  stormwater/drainage); advisory roles; monitoring and reporting; coordination and liaison;  shared planning and co-management; funding partners; information sharing; and research  and educational roles.  40     ▪  Academic Institutions – Research roles including research funding and student support roles.  ▪  Industry and Businesses – Advisory roles; monitoring and reporting; funding partners; research and educational roles.  ▪  Community – Community members are engaging in various aspects of planning and management such as:   ▪ Attracting landowners to planning tables;  ▪Gathering information on watershed history and resource use;  ▪ Identifying community and watershed values and identifying priorities;  ▪Collecting input, feedback and advice on key issues and documents;  ▪Organizing special events and open houses;  ▪Collecting resource data;  ▪Reporting violations; and,  ▪Managing communications and media relations.  Good Practices for Collaborative Multi-stakeholder Processes  Bringing the right people together to discuss the myriad of issues within a watershed is no easy task, but when done well, it can be an  efficient, credible, and cost effective means of developing integrated and robust solutions. There is no single approach to designing a  multi-stakeholder process; however, a broad set of principles, or good practices, that contribute to successful outcomes of collaborative  decision-making processes is emerging. The following table identifies several key elements and expected results of stakeholder  engagement for successful watershed planning.  Criterion    Description  Purpose and incentives    The process is driven by a shared purpose and provides incentives to participate and to work towards achieving consensus in the process.  All participants should agree on the types of issues to be addressed by the planning process. A clear “terms of reference” may allow groups  to decide whether to participate or not.   Stakeholder participation      All parties with a significant interest in the issues and outcome are involved throughout the process. These could include residents, farmers,  ranchers, businesses, industries and others. Representatives should be selected in a fair and open manner by each of the groups that have  an interest in the outcome. Timelines for the planning process need to accommodate stakeholder participation and engagement.  Voluntary participation and commitment  Parties, who are affected and/or interested, participate voluntarily and are committed to the process.  Self-design    The parties involved work together to design the process to suit the needs of that process and its participants.  Clear ground rules    As the process is initiated, a comprehensive procedural framework is established which includes clear terms of reference and operating  procedures. This part of the process can also help to clarify realities and expectations in terms of roles, responsibilities and limitations.  Equal opportunity and resources  The process provides an equal and balanced opportunity for effective participation of all parties.   Principled negotiation and respect   Multi-stakeholder planning proceeds from the assumption that everyone has something to gain by reaching agreement. The process  operates according to the conditions of principled negotiation, including mutual respect, trust and understanding.  Accountability    The process and its participants are accountable to the broader public, to their constituents, and to the process itself.  Flexible, adaptive and creative  Flexibility is designed into the process to allow for adaptation and creativity in problem solving.   High-quality information    The process incorporates high-quality information into decision-making. All participants should share information and cooperate to gather  what information is needed for effective planning.   Cooperation    Cooperation and working relationships between participating groups is improved both during and after the process is completed.   Time limits    Realistic milestones and deadlines are established and managed throughout the process.  Commitment to implementation and monitoring The process and final agreement include clear commitments to implementation and monitoring.  Effective process management  The process is coordinated and managed effectively.   Independent facilitation    The process uses an independent trained facilitator throughout. This may not be necessary in all cases, particularly where the planning  issues may be less conflicted, where the community is not polarized, or where the lead facilitator of the planning process has established  trust and credibility within the community.   Adapted from both WCEL (2010) and Frame et al. (2004)  41    Collaboration with First Nations  Intergovernmental relations around water and  watershed management are challenging, and  the case is no different with First Nations. A  key observation that emerged from workshops  held with First Nations in the summer of 2010 is  that “First Nations are often not consulted, not  consulted enough, or not consulted soon enough”.  In some cases, this is attributed to existing policies  and structures that limit participation by First  Nations, and there is a sense that addressing  First Nations’ rights can slow down a planning or  decision-making process.  There is significant concern among First Nations  that “although First Nations across Canada are  already experiencing the impacts of climate  change, they are often left out of policy discussions  that will affect water health and security in their  territories”. 8 Although stakeholder engagement  sessions were conducted specifically for direct First  Nations input some Bands have indicated the need  for more direct participation in the modernization of  BC’s Water Act.  In some cases, limited participation by First Nations  relates to limited capacity within their communities.  It can be challenging for smaller First Nation  communities who have limited resources to keep  up with government invitations to participate in  a multitude of referrals, and other planning and  decision-making processes. There is also concern  that participating in such processes can sometimes  be misinterpreted as “representing the First Nation  community”—a mandate that may not actually be  afforded to one individual. 8  Working towards more effective collaboration  with First Nations requires building government- to-government relationships that acknowledge  Aboriginal title and rights. To foster these  relationships, it is important to develop a shared  vision that celebrates differences as well as areas  of common ground. A shared vision enables the  identification of key issues, shared goals, and action  plans, and a commitment to shared decision- making. Through trial and error, experiences  across BC have culminated in the identification of  some beneficial practices for collaboration with  First Nations. A series of recommended best  management practices for building successful and  positive relationships between First Nations and local  governments was developed at a workshop with  regional districts in 2005. Many of these practices  also apply to other relationships within collaborative  decision-making processes:   ▪ Establish a relationship before there is a problem;  ▪  Respect each other’s differences   (i.e., do not try to change each other);  ▪  Recognize and understand that history and   past experiences impact current perceptions   and opinions;  ▪  Focus on learning about each other’s history  and initiate information-sharing events early in  the process to learn about the respective roles,  responsibilities and history of each   other’s organizations;   ▪Recognize the importance of a First Nations Chief and Council;  ▪  Focus on slow, incremental steps and recognize that success   cannot be measured in the short term;   ▪  Work towards the project agenda after individual relationships are  solidified and unified;   ▪  Define the nature and scope of the relationship early (including an  understanding of each other’s needs and the reason for interaction);   ▪ Focus on areas of common concern or interest;  ▪  Identify the elements of uncertainty and work towards addressing   them before they create friction in the relationship;   ▪Be prepared to resolve disputes and agreements;  ▪ Establish a process and forum for communication and dialogue;  ▪  Exchange staff lists to allow for quick and effective contact between  organizations; and,    ▪  Confirm expectations and assumptions throughout the relationship.  Leadership and Local Champions  Collaborative planning processes benefit significantly from good  leadership. Having a champion behind a planning initiative can really  help motivate a group, and keep it focused on the end goal. This can  be particularly important to sustaining interest, support and momentum  over the long term during the development and implementation of  the plan. Planning can take time, patience and persistence, and a  committed and passionate champion can help build and maintain the  necessary momentum. This is especially important during periods of  conflict or other challenges.   A widely respected and credible leader can also inspire broader  participation and collaboration within a planning process. For example,  someone who has the respect of farmers, business owners and  community activists can strengthen the credibility of a planning process,  and thus inspire these and other stakeholders to participate in it. A leader  may be a mayor, chief, or chair of a regional district or other prominent  board. However, local champions can also be highly respected citizens,  volunteers, retired professionals, or other community leaders with less  official designations.   If there is no apparent single leader within a process, it can be helpful to  bring in people from around the region and/or country who have relevant  experience and expertise on key issues. For example, in the early stages  of developing the planning process for the Coquitlam River Watershed  Strategy, people from outside the watershed were invited to share their  successes and failures with their roundtable processes. This helped  set the bar and create inspiration within the planning group. From this  foundation, leadership emerged from different factions of the community,  including government and beyond.   8.3 ReGiOnAl APPROAChes  Being proactive by planning for watersheds and climate adaptation can  be especially challenging for communities that have limited human and  financial resources. Introducing water centric thinking can be particularly  challenging when facing common issues such as jurisdictional conflicts  or a lack of expertise. Changing the “old way of doing business” does  not happen overnight, and achieving water sustainability is less likely to  happen if communities work in isolation of each other.   In some cases, local leadership can be supplemented and/or strengthened  with collaborative approaches at the regional scale. This can be particularly  appropriate when implementing a watershed-based approach and an  integrated approach. For example, Convening for Action on Vancouver  Island, the Okanagan Basin Water Board and the Fraser Basin Council  offer several opportunities to collaborate at regional scales to strengthen  community resiliency, protect watershed health, prepare for climate change  and advance sustainability.   42    8.3.1 COnVeninG fOR ACtiOn On VAnCOuVeR islAnd  Convening for Action on Vancouver Island (CAVI) is an exciting initiative that has  emerged in response to the need to plan for sustainable water resources within the  context of a rapidly growing population. CAVI is not a formal organization; rather, it could  be considered as an “ad hoc group” designed to provide leadership, coordination,  research and education for practitioners, specifically local government administrators,  engineers, planners and elected officials.  CAVI’s focus is to build an understanding about how we should be dealing with water  as it relates to conservation, development and land use. CAVI does not use a particular  planning tool or process. Instead, it uses the informal process of collaboration to build  capacity and a network of like-minded individuals across Vancouver Island so these  individuals can harness the tools of local government (e.g., Official Community Plans,  bylaws) to bring about positive change in local watersheds. Education and communication  are other key tools that CAVI uses. Its aim is to move from talk to action by developing  tools, providing training and building capacity.   At the heart of the initiative is the concept of water centric planning. Through education and  awareness-building initiatives, including learning lunches, CAVI demonstrates how water centric  approaches and specific tools can be integrated into existing planning processes.   “At CAVI, we bring together those who plan and regulate land use (local governments), those  who build (developers), and those who provide the legislative framework (the Province). We  provide the expertise and support to municipalities and organizations with a focus on achieving  water sustainability and then help them to share their ideas and successes so that others can  see how they too can get on board”    Since its launch in September 2006, CAVI has witnessed considerable success in getting  its message out, and is seeing mindsets beginning to shift towards water centric thinking,  planning and decision-making. Participants in the CAVI process include the BC Water and  Waste Association, Real Estate Foundation of BC, Ministry of Environment, Ministry of  Community and Rural Development (now Community, Sport and Cultural Development),  municipalities and regional districts, POLIS, private consultants, developers, academics, First  Nations and citizens’ groups.  Participants attribute some of this success to the fact that “CAVI has no baggage, no  requirements, no regulatory authority—it simply provides a forum for people to talk about  common problems and solutions, and interact through workshops, the Waterbucket website,  conferences, and seminars”. The emphasis on collaboration within CAVI, and focus on  integration across the Vancouver Island region have also been critical success factors. Finally,  many of CAVI’s activities fulfill the principles of Living Water Smart, British Columbia’s Water  Plan, and aligning with these principles has proven beneficial for local governments that are  seeking funding to support water planning and management.   “On Vancouver Island, local governments are demonstrating what can be accomplished through  partnerships and collaboration. Success in moving from awareness to action is ultimately keyed  to a regional team approach that is founded on the notion of shared responsibility”   –John Finnie, CAVI Chair  8.3.2 OkAnAGAn bAsin WAteR bOARd  The Okanagan Basin is one of BC’s fastest growing regions. With increasing demands for water  by residents, tourists, and agricultural producers (which accounts for as much as 70% of water  use in the basin), it is a region under pressure. Significant water shortages occur in the summer  months, and groundwater resources are vulnerable to contamination and drawdown.   In the Okanagan Valley, a regional approach has proven useful for advancing water management  decisions. “The Okanagan Basin Water Board (OBWB) was initiated in 1968 (legislated in 1970)  as a water governance body tasked with identifying and resolving critical water issues at the  scale of the Okanagan watershed…The overall objective of the organization is to undertake  strategic projects and programs at the Basin scale that meet the collective needs of Okanagan  citizens for long-term sustainable water supplies while supporting the capacity of member  jurisdictions to meet their own water management goals” (www.obwb.ca/about/).   The Board is comprised of representatives from each of the three regional districts in the  basin: Okanagan-Similkameen, Central Okanagan and North Okanagan. The Board also has  representation from First Nations, the Water Supply Association of BC, and the Okanagan  Water Stewardship Council, which was formed in 2006. The Board is unique in its powers  to tax and pass bylaws, and is supported through annual property tax assessments within  the basin. The Board does not have regulatory authority but seeks to improve water  management by providing a basin-wide perspective and improving communications among   regions to reduce fragmentation in policy and  planning. The Board also works to improve  links between local and senior governments by  participating as a partner in Okanagan water  research and infrastructure funding.  Whereas municipalities and regional districts  continue to plan for local water needs, watershed- scale considerations are addressed at the regional  level through the leadership of the OBWB. Some  key activities of the Board include:   ▪  Implementing basin-wide programs for millfoil  control, sewage infrastructure funding, water  science and management;   ▪  Acting as a hub for water information by  increasing communication, building partnerships  and reducing duplication;   ▪  Acting as a voice for okanagan water interests  by advocating and representing local needs to  senior governments;   ▪  Providing science-based information to  decision makers;   ▪  Expanding local capacity by providing a stable  source of funding and in-kind partnerships,  and by being a single organizing body for  coordinating watershed projects; and   ▪  Providing a forum for debate about   watershed priorities.    Through its work, the OBWB has sought to  integrate Okanagan water policy and planning on  a basin-scale by bridging the interests of multiple  jurisdictions and shifting towards implementing  policies and agreements that protect water  supplies. The Okanagan Sustainable Water  Strategy (2008), which identifies top priorities for  implementation in the basin in the coming years,  illustrates how a regional approach can be applied  to water planning and management. Numerous  recommendations made in this action plan are  being implemented incrementally, and successes  in groundwater monitoring and establishing a   43    water use reporting process have already been  achieved. Many of the actions identified in the plan  require inter-jurisdictional arrangements so that  communities of the basin can prepare for climate  change and population growth in the watershed.  The OBWB is the mechanism for bringing these  groups together on a regional basin scale to plan  and manage water resources. 12  8.3.3 fRAseR bAsin COunCil  In the Fraser River Basin, the Fraser Basin   Council (FBC) strengthens regional and  watershed-based approaches to address a wide  variety of sustainability issues. Formed in 1997,  the FBC is a charitable, not-for-profit organization  with a primary mandate “to advance sustainability  in British Columbia with a core focus on the  Fraser River Basin.” FBC has a collaborative  governance structure, which is led by 37 directors  from the four orders of government—federal,  provincial, local and First Nations—and from the  private sector and civil society.   Well into its second decade of service, the FBC  works to bring people together to find practical,  common sense solutions to long-standing  and emerging sustainability issues, such as  community planning, watershed health and  climate change adaptation.   To achieve its goals, the FBC serves as an impartial,  trusted facilitator operating under a unique model  of collaborative leadership. The FBC was founded  on the belief that the major sustainability priorities,  including management of the Fraser Basin, cannot  be effectively addressed by any one jurisdiction but  rather by bringing together the diversity of interests  and jurisdictions to solve complex problems.  The reason so many contentious issues remain  unresolved is often because leaders in different  sectors are working in isolation of each other.   The overall framework for the Fraser Basin Council’s  work is the Charter for Sustainability. The charter  is a good-faith agreement, signed in 1997, by  representatives from multiple sectors across the  Fraser Basin who believed in collaborative action for  a more sustainable future.   From the charter comes FBC’s vision statement and guiding principles, along with a definition  of sustainability, described as:  “Living and managing activities in a way that balances social, economic, environmental and  institutional considerations to meet our needs and those of future generations.”    The Fraser Basin Council delivers programs and projects in each of the five regions of the  Fraser River Basin: Upper Fraser, Cariboo-Chilcotin, Thompson, Fraser Valley and Greater   Vancouver-Sea to Sky.   The following are a few highlights of Fraser Basin Council accomplishments, all of which were  undertaken with regional and collaborative approaches. The FBC:   ▪  Worked with more than 100 local governments and 26 first nations across bc on community  sustainability planning and climate change adaptation;   ▪  Improved fraser basin salmon habitat, stock management, fisheries information and re¬lated  outreach with a high level of aboriginal engagement and many working partnerships for the  health of bc fisheries;   ▪  Launched and contributed directly to the development of a land use planning process for  the shuswap lakes system to encourage development in less sensitive areas of shuswap  and mara lakes, to improve waste¬water management and to study recreational impacts.  Current priorities and next steps include protecting and restoring foreshore habitat,  maintaining and improving water quality, informing and educating the public and industry  groups, and initiating coordinated development and recreation plans;   ▪  Led a panel of independent experts, result¬ing in canada’s first provincial legislation on  drinking water protection;   ▪  Published four comprehensive sustainabil¬ity snapshot indicators reports, and several  regional reports, on the health of the fraser basin and province of bc to raise awareness and  encourage action across sectors on economic, social and environmental issues; and,   ▪  Developed the strategy for, and created bc’s first council on, invasive plants, which has  received national recognition.  8.4 humAn And finAnCiAl ResOuRCes  “Water is a liquid more precious than oil”  –Tony Blair, former British Prime Minister   Integrated water and watershed planning requires a dedicated and skilled team of people.  Ongoing involvement in a collaborative planning process is a significant commitment for local  governments and others, who often cite inadequate resources and overtaxed staff as primary  limitations on being more proactively engaged in certain aspects of watershed protection. Some  local governments also note that watershed planning is a specialized skill that is beyond the  training of many people. Without the necessary financial and human resources it is challenging  for some communities to effectively manage and/or participate in collaborative processes.   Within this challenging context of limited financial and human resources, the BC experience  is showing that success in advancing water and watershed planning often comes down to  creative initiatives and well-conceived projects. While an increase in both financial and human  resources is desirable, it may not be realistic in many communities. Instead, communities are  required to work more creatively with both internal and external resources in order to advance  their goals for water and watershed protection.   44    8.4.1 stRenGthen humAn   ResOuRCes  Human resources, both in terms of availability  and expertise, can be a limitation to water and  watershed planning and to climate adaptation.  Both areas require a strong team of experts with  specialized knowledge, expertise and skill sets.  Contracting out portions of the work to supplement  or complement staff skills and expertise may be  possible in some circumstances; however, this  option is not always available to local governments,  which often have limited funds.   Capacity may be limited in smaller BC  communities, where there may be only one or two  municipal staff to cover planning responsibilities,  and where funds may be too limited to cover the  costs of hiring consultants. This may be a particular  challenge for proactive initiatives, such as water  and watershed planning, and for integrating climate  change adaptation into such plans.   First Nations also have limited capacity to undertake  water planning, management and governance due  to small staff sizes and limited resources for training  community members in key water planning and  management skills. Compounding these challenges  are circumstances where there are many other  priorities for First Nations that compete for limited  resources and staff capacity.    In contrast, larger local governments, such as Metro  Vancouver and the Capital Regional District, which  have greater staff capacity, are able to attract more  funds, and advance planning and management  initiatives. These larger communities are also better  able to interact with other initiatives and institutions,  which can lead to more learning opportunities.   The Value of a Coordinator  Many communities have found that having a  project coordinator is often key to the success  of water and watershed planning initiatives.  In the case of the Bowker Creek Urban  Watershed Renewal Initiative, having a part-time  Coordinator, whose salary is cost-shared by all  three participating municipalities, has been key  to securing project funding. This person is able  to dedicate time to writing grant applications,  and having a Coordinator has given the project  greater credibility. A Watershed Coordinator  has also helped secure funds for the Theodosia  Stewardship Roundtable and Watershed Recovery  Plan, and as a result, he is able to focus on both  land and water management within the watershed.   8.4.2 stRenGthen finAnCiAl  ResOuRCes  Resourcing can significantly influence the success  of planning, and is commonly cited as a limiting  factor in planning processes. Resources are  needed to establish and manage a planning  process, and to implement its outcomes (i.e.,  the plan’s recommendations). Effective strategies  for resourcing water and water planning  arrangements include:   ▪  Working with the financial resources that you and your partners have;  ▪  Using consultants only when necessary (often best for technical work);  ▪  Writing the plan with in-house staff can save money; and   ▪  Hiring a coordinator to oversee the planning process.   Whether a planning initiative is just beginning, in mid process, or ready for implementation,  financial resources play a significant role in the timing, momentum, and in some cases, the  outcomes of the process. The funding environment for water and watershed planning in BC is  challenging and competitive. Funds are limited; therefore, competition for grants is high. Local  governments indicate that funds are available for infrastructure work but are more difficult to  obtain for watershed based planning work unless the work relates specifically to drinking water.  Local governments also have limited human resources for developing project proposals and  writing and submitting grant applications.   The situation is similar for climate adaptation planning processes. While funds may be  available for climate adaptation planning, it is more difficult for local governments to  secure funds to implement adaptation measures. Even in communities that have been  actively developing climate adaptation plans, it is difficult to justify spending substantial  sums of money on implementing those plans. For example, making proactive choices  to upgrade municipal utilities may make sense on one level, but when there may be no  immediate, tangible benefits, it can be difficult to persuade taxpayers and elected officials  to commit to large investments.   Develop a Financial Strategy  Planning processes invariably take longer than expected. Thinking the process through  in terms of phases and how those phases will be financed is an important step. It is first  necessary to know what needs to be accomplished and what the measurable objectives are  for the various aspects of the project. For each objective, consider:    ▪When will the money be needed?   ▪Where will it come from?   ▪How will it be directed?   “If you wait until you have enough money, you’ll never do it.”    –  ToM ruTherFord, Georgia Basin Living Rivers Program  When developing a funding model or strategy it is important to be creative. There is no single,  certain way of securing funds for a watershed project. Each community has its own set of  challenges and opportunities. A successful financial strategy will take both challenges and  opportunities into consideration. The following are recommendations, gathered from various  communities across the province, for successfully obtaining project funding:   ▪  Be strategic; look at the bigger picture. Design your project so that it can advance multiple  objectives, such as climate change mitigation and/or adaptation and environmental  enhancement. Recently, the integration of climate change adaptation into planning projects  has become strategic from a funding perspective. Local governments, such as the Capital  Regional District, intend to draw on this to the best of their abilities by tapping into funds for  pilot initiatives. Another “big picture approach” is to integrate watershed planning within land  use decisions. This may open up new opportunities by diversifying funding sources.   ▪  Align with common objectives. Identifying how various departments and/or external  organizations can contribute to project objectives is important for moving a project forward,  both within the planning process and during implementation. The approach adopted within  the Whistler 2020 Plan was intended to allow the community to use community resources  in a more strategic and coordinated way. The community of Whistler invested time in  identifying common goals and a shared vision across organizations within the community.  Rather than requiring new resources, the Whistler2020 approach is based on the alignment  of existing budgets and resources to ensure that all relevant organizations and individuals  are dedicated to moving toward a shared goal rather than working inefficiently or at cross- purposes. This approach seeks to make the best use of existing resources.   ▪  Be realistic about project timelines and budgets. The Bowker Creek Initiative adopted  a 100-year timeline because the work that needs to be done in the watershed is too  costly to be funded all at once. Rather than getting bogged down in the high costs of  implementation, the team developed a long-term plan that focuses on specific reaches  of the creek and on achieving incremental progress. Municipalities can agree in principle  about the scope and direction of the plan without being held responsible for spending  a specific amount of money. The idea behind this strategy is not to deflect responsibility  and “do nothing”; rather, once the regional district saw past the financial challenges, they  committed to moving the plan forward by working on key short-term actions now that  would set them up for bigger things in the future.   45     ▪  Leverage funds. Grant leveraging entails using one  source of funds to attract and match funds from  other sources. It is an effective means of bringing in  additional money to support an expanding project  or one with an extended timeline.   ▪  Consider what can be accomplished without  financial contributions. Participants in the  Theodosia Stewardship Roundtable state that  planning groups do not need a lot of money to  initiate watershed planning. In-kind contributions  can be a significant source of resources for  getting a project started. Once successes  start to be demonstrated through the use  of these contributions, it becomes easier to  attract funds from other sources. Participants  in the Theodosia planning process expect that  down the road, when they have established a  good mechanism for making watershed-based  decisions, their Roundtable will actually attract  money rather than cost money. They expect that  outside funders will see value in the process, and  will want to support it.   Consider Alternative Sources of Funds  Various means of generating funds for water  management projects have been tried in different  communities. Some of these are listed below. It  is important to consider the potential that these  may bring, within the context of each community.  Conducting an economic analysis of which  mechanisms are most appropriate to a community  would be beneficial, as would an assessment of  public and political support for those mechanisms.    ▪  Development Cost Charges (DCCs) have been  used in some BC communities to support  operational initiatives in water management. As  a pilot project, the town of Oliver, BC received  approval to use DCC funds collected from new  development to help establish water meters for  existing homes with the resulting water savings  becoming available to provide water services to  new homes. DCCs have also been a key part of  the City of Surrey’s strategy to build sustainable  drainage infrastructure. Surrey has used the funds  to pay for a roadside storm water management  swale/multi-use greenway in a new development,  rather than the usual purchase of 5-6% of the  area for the purposes of a detention pond.   ▪  Volume-based Water Use Fees can be applied  either to individuals or water suppliers to target  heavy-use water consumers and to provide  incentives for water conservation. The fee structure  needs to be equitable to avoid creating economic  hardship for low-income residents and the  agricultural community.   ▪  Municipal Drainage Utilities can be formed as  an alternate source of raising funding. This  approach can help ensure dedicated funding for  drainage and stormwater planning, infrastructure  and operations.   ▪  Water Licence Fees collected by the Ministry of Forests, Lands and Natural  Resource Operations currently go into provincial general revenue. In theory,  a portion of these funds could be directed to specifically support water and  watershed planning. If local government becomes actively involved in licence  administration at any level, some of these funds could be used to fund water  conservation and management projects at the local level.16   ▪  Recreational User Fees applied to powerboat or off-road vehicle rentals are a  means of targeting polluting activities of tourists or seasonal residents who do  not otherwise contribute funds to water management in a region.16   ▪  Reserve Funds can be established by implementing changes in service delivery  systems (e.g., contracting out a regional service), which can sometimes translate  into savings for a local government. In the Region of Peel, in Ontario, such a savings  translated into a permanent, annual cost reduction of 1.5% on water rates. Staff  commitment and forward thinking leadership enabled these savings to be channeled  into a fund, which is not constrained by the normal budget cycle. The City of Toronto  directed revenue from property sales into the “Toronto Atmospheric Revolving Fund”,  which finances innovative greenhouse gas emission reduction projects. Interest and  royalties from these projects are returned to the fund. One merit of this approach is  that it does not require any additional taxation.   8.5 infORmAtiOn And knOWledGe  The importance of accurate, relevant and meaningful data, information and  knowledge cannot be underestimated in relation to water and watershed planning.  Although subtle nuances differentiate data from information and knowledge, for the  purposes of this section of the guide, the term “information” will be used explicitly, and  data and knowledge will be considered as being related implicitly.  Information is critical to water and watershed planning in a variety of ways. Information  about current (or historical) water issues, challenges and conflicts alerts communities  and decision makers about the need for planning, policy and/or operational  management actions. Information about future scenarios, such as population  projections or climate change scenarios, can help inform planners and others about  possible issues they may need to address. Information about the effectiveness of  management options can be used to assess recommended actions in response to  current or future challenges.  8.5.1 infORmAtiOn needs And sOuRCes  The following are some examples of data and information that may be beneficial  or necessary to inform a water and watershed planning process:  Current and projected future water supply:   ▪ Seasonal and annual streamflow (volume and timing);  ▪ Surface and groundwater reserves (extent and volume);  ▪Changes to precipitation and evapotranspiration as a result of climate change; and,  ▪Changes to storage and distribution capacity associated with water supplies.  Current and projected future water demand:   ▪Current water use by all human consumptive and non-consumptive uses;  ▪  Current instream flow requirements for fish, wildlife, habitat and ecosystem  functions; and,  ▪  Changes to water demand as a result of population growth, community and  economic development and/or climate change.  Current and projected future threats to water quality:   ▪Changes to settlement patterns, land use and associated pollutants; and,  ▪  Changes to hydrology and geomorphology as a result of land use, land cover  and/or climate change.  Data and information are also needed to monitor and measure performance in relation to  the objectives and desired outcomes of a water or watershed plan (or related regulatory  requirements). For example, it may be necessary to monitor compliance with water  licences, instream flow requirements, water use restrictions, wastewater discharges,  riparian area regulations and/or water quality standards or objectives. If performance  measures are not established and assessed, it may not be possible to determine if the  goals and objectives of a water or watershed plan are being achieved.  46    Some examples of information sources to support water and watershed planning  are listed below (in alphabetical order). In many cases, further analysis of available  information and/or more detailed local information will be necessary to support  planning processes. See Section 9 of this guide Tools and Resources for more  information (including web links) about where to go for relevant information on  water, watershed and climate science.   ▪BC Hydro – Regional Hydromet Data   ▪BC Ministry of Environment – Environmental Protection Division, Water Quality   ▪BC Ministry of Environment – Groundwater Wells and Aquifer Database  ▪  BC Ministry of Forests, Lands & Natural Resource Operations   – River Forecast Centre   ▪ Environment Canada – Meteorological Service   ▪ Environment Canada – Real-Time Hydrometric Data   ▪ Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium – Plan2Adapt   8.5.2 infORmAtiOn GAPs And limitAtiOns  Data for water, watershed and climate change planning is not available consistently  across the province. Numerous information gaps present a challenge to water and  watershed planning. For example, there may be gaps or limitations in:   ▪  Spatial coverage (e.g., available information may not cover a particular river,  stream, lake or watershed);   ▪  Temporal coverage (e.g., a full range of historical or current information,   or future projections may not be available); and,   ▪  Measured parameters (e.g., information may be available for only a subset   of the necessary water quantity or quality variables).  Basic hydrological information is not available for many streams, lakes and aquifers in  BC. Similarly, water quality information is limited. Although there are requirements for  measuring and reporting on drinking water quality, there are many information gaps  on instream water quality for waterbodies that are not used for drinking water.  In some regions, such as the Capital Regional District, where communities  are close to academic institutions, there is a relatively good supply of data  and information to inform planning efforts. However, in small to mid-sized  communities, less data is available both for climate and water and watershed  planning. Also, in some cases, loal governments do not always know what data  are available or how to source or use the data.   While it is widely recognized that in many regions of the province aquifers are  vulnerable to multiple sources of depletion and pollution, groundwater data are  relatively limited. The submission of well log information, which is housed by the  Province, is voluntary, and people are often slow in submitting the data or they  provide incomplete information. Accessing data for privately held upland areas  in watersheds is another significant challenge for local governments. Forest  companies are required to file detailed environmental plans for every cutblock;  however, this information typically is not made available.   Communities may be able to acquire data, but in many cases it is not in an  accessible format. Local governments have experienced considerable challenges  related to the format and completeness of data. Often, data are developed for  specific purposes and are not compatible with other purposes or a particular  study area. In other cases, available data may not be specific enough for  developing plans for a particular region or watershed. Regional districts report  that it is sometimes challenging to work with data from various member  municipalities because there is no standardized format for the data. Finally, the  level of detail in which data are presented is not always useful. For example,  in a community such as Tofino, which has very localized weather cells, it is  difficult to use general climate data because the nearest weather station is not  representative of the weather in Tofino.   Information gaps and limitations grow significantly when it comes to  understanding the complexity of watershed resources, health and function. In  an ideal scenario, a watershed inventory and assessment is undertaken to build  a broad understanding of the full resources, functions and characteristics of a  watershed. In many cases, watershed inventories and assessments have not   1   Brandes, Oliver et. al. (2005). At A Watershed: Ecological  Governance and Sustainable Water Management in Canada.

There is no single, comprehensive source  of watershed data.  Information resources should be considered in  a similar light as financial and human resources.  As with funding and people, information is a  critical element to support a water or watershed  planning process. However, there can be  significant limitations and constraints that need  to be understood and addressed in order to  acquire and use the information necessary to  develop and implement watershed plans.  47      9. tools & Resources  This section of the guide provides a listing of  tools and resources that are available to assist  organizations with water and watershed planning   as well as climate change adaptation.
