 How global warming will affect the climate and weather  patterns across Canada is complicated by the vast landscapes that comprise our nation, and the complex array of  direct and indirect effects that are already anticipated.  Our uncertain future should compel professionals and  decision-makers to be better informed and more capable of making effective and insightful decisions.    Our hope for a stable and sustainable future requires that action be taken today. Whether the goal is to reduce  the emissions that are warming the planet, or to prepare society for anticipated changes, efforts towards  mitigation and adaptation must begin now.  Everyone is responsible, everyone needs to act.     The PRIMERs are provided in a four-volume set.  PRIMER ONE summarizes the science on climate weather and  change.  PRIMER TWO provides information on how individuals, communities and organizations can begin now to  prepare for anticipated changes.  PRIMER THREE presents planning and design tools, existing and emerging, that  can help in the creation of resilient and prosperous communities and sustainable ecosystems.  PRIMER FOUR  summarizes approaches and tools focused on one of the fastest emerging challenges – rising water levels.     The Primers are intended to augment your basic understanding of the science on global warming and climate  change, to provide improved access to information on anticipated impacts to Canadian landscapes, and to promote  improved understanding of the options available to society through adaptive planning for change.  Should you wish  to expand your understanding on the topics discussed, access the materials referenced in the Additional Readings  and Resources on the Web, and reach out to do your own search for newer information.  Climate adaptation is a  rapidly evolving knowledge area.    The Primers rely on two categories of information: reports and papers that have been freely distributed on the  internet; and a selection of books and peer-reviewed papers.  Many of the reports and books referenced are  available from public or university libraries.  Should the URLs provided for material available on the internet  become inactive, it could mean only that the material has been moved, not that it is outdated or no longer relevant.   We encourage you to search by author and/or title to find the document.     Peer reviewed papers are included here because they are an important source of information on climate change  science, mitigation and adaptation, and the first access point for new knowledge.  Some journal papers are  provided freely on the Internet.  Unfortunately, digital access to other journals requires paid subscriptions, or  individual papers can be purchased on-line.  Most university libraries in Canada provide memberships to the public  for a nominal annual fee, but not all may include access to online journals.  However, in addition to borrowing  texts, hard and/or electronic copies of many journals can be viewed at the library.  Readers can also become  members of local, regional, or national communities of practice, where enrollment and access to many valuable  sources of information are freely provided.         PRIMER ONE:    CLIMATE, WEATHER AND CHANGE   Chapters One and Two provide users with a summary   of the current science on global warming, and the   current and projected future changes in weather and   climate throughout Canada.  Chapter Three   summarizes current thinking on the effects   anticipated environmental change will have on   ecosystems, on society and on local as well as   regional economics.     PRIMER TWO:    PREPARING FOR CHANGE   Chapter Four focusses on managing risk and   understanding the role played in decision-making by   uncertainty.  Chapter Five outlines the need to   change what we do, to mitigate and to adapt.    Chapter Six provides direction for those seeking a   better future, incorporating existing instruments and   tools with emerging principles and processes for   guiding change.   PRIMER THREE:   CREATING RESILIENT COMMUNITIES   Chapter Seven summarizes opportunities to create   resilient communities that integrate with their natural   environment and promote well being and   sustainability for humans and ecosystems.    PRIMER FOUR:   FACING RISING WATERS   Chapter Eight examines preventative and protective   measures to rising water, whether it is fresh water   (overland flooding) or the result of rising sea levels   and/or storm surges.       2 | P a g e    7 ELEMENTS OF A RESILIENT COMMUNITY  7.1 A NEW WAY OF THINKING   In 2015, the internationally respected scientist Johan Rockstrom gave an impassioned public  lecture in Waterloo, Ontario.  Rockstrom outlined already evident consequences of what he calls  the switch in perspectives from small world - big planet to big world - small planet (Rockstrom and  Klum 2015).  Rockstrom’s premise is that infinite material growth worked only when we were living  in a relatively small world on a large planet that was able to absorb all the stresses from human  society.  For over 25 years it has been increasingly apparent that the world of humans is a big world  on a small planet, a planet which is not doing so well anymore.  Climate change is but one situation  where often unforeseen thresholds have been crossed, and the natural environment has been  proven unable to cope.  While many scientists are pretty sure that life on the planet will continue  despite climate change, they are less confident that human society will be able to continue on the  same path.  It is readily becoming apparent that sustainability is no longer a utopian ideal, it is  critical to human well-being in an increasingly antagonistic world.     In his writing, Rockstrom and his highly accomplished peers seek to  establish an “authoritative baseline” for new thinking about human  development.  They provide a new narrative for humanity, one  based upon two realities: first - a thorough understanding of the  effects unbridled human development has had on reducing the  viability of the planet, and second the need to focus on the  opportunities to thrive that are ever present if we rely on core  values and use ingenuity and humanism to become wise stewards  of the natural world.         “Global warming allows us the most incredible opportunity to   change social systems, environmental systems, how we do   business, how we build, how we plan.     Wow, I mean to be young again, and to have this incredible   menu of challenges and to be able to weave them into robust   and vibrant communities. Dealing with climate change is a   question of economic competitiveness and of equity-to ensure   a high quality of life for all, across the world as well as our   future generations.”   Ron Sims, participant at the May 2008 Urban Leaders partner meeting,   Seattle WA   A NEW WAY OF THINKING (adapted from Rockstrom and Klum 2015):   • LOOK CLOSELY AT CLIMATE CHANGE:  The risks posed by human society are undeniable   • THIS CRISIS IS GLOBAL, LOCAL AND URGENT:  The world is already changing, and the future   depends on what we do next.   • EVERYTHING IS HYPER-CONNECTED:  Nature, the economy and politics.   • EXPECT THE UNEXPECTED:  Large systems are no longer predictable or reliable.  Change is now   the only constant.   • RESPECT PLANETARY THRESHOLDS:  Avoid triggering tipping points in fundamental physical and   ecological processes.   • CONNECT THE DOTS:  Actions are not without consequences.  Jobs and the environment are   interdependent.    • PROTECT NATURAL HERITAGE:  Not just for its own sake, but to safeguard our prosperity.   • TURN THINGS AROUND:  Reversing negative trends is an investment in future prosperity.  Business   as usual no longer works.   • UNLEASH INNOVATION:  Search for creativity for innovation and for profitable alternatives.   ‘It’s a future that is techier, cooler,  healthier, and therefore a very  exciting journey.’   Rockstrom and Klum 2015     3 | P a g e    7.1.1 CHANGE AS A POSITIVE FORCE   While we may have as few as 50 years to make the changes  needed to curb emissions and adapt to current and horizon  impacts, this may not be so very hard to accomplish.  Clearly,  the myriad communities of Canada looked dramatically  different in 1901 than they do today (Figure 7-1).  As Condon  (2010) noted, in the 50 years between 1950 and 2000, the  landscapes and dynamics of most North American cities were  dramatically transformed.  Driving largely replaced walking and  buses replaced street cars.  Most of these villages, towns and  cities not only changed their landscapes, significant changes  occurred in their supporting industries, in their demographics,  and in individual health and well-being.  Similarly, we can  anticipate that the coasts of today will not be the coasts of  tomorrow, and that change in and of itself can be a positive  force.    Change can also create opportunities if societies are positioned  to withstand the impacts and take advantage of the benefits.   Creating a resilient society will require significant and proactive  alteration of ‘business as usual’.     The first steps towards creating a resilient society should  include:   • conserving natural heritage to protect and to support  human society;   • adjusting regional and local planning and policy;   • greening the rural and urban landscape;   • building to last;   • caring for cultural landscapes; and   • preparing the home ground.                   “Whatever is the solution, we  know for sure the North American  city will need a dramatic retrofit.”    (Patrick Condon, 2010 p12)   FIGURE 7-1:  The Toronto waterfront in 1901 and in 2018 (Image Credits: Wikipedia Commons/ C. Mercer Clarke).     4 | P a g e    7.1.2 THE WAY FORWARD    In the historic development of many North American cities, amongst the first things built were streetcar  networks.  Streetcar cities provided easy access to public transit, a range of housing opportunities, and jobs and  services located a short walk (or streetcar ride) from home.  Prior to 1940, these urban centres had the  underpinnings of a sustainable city, producing almost no greenhouse gases in order to get around (Condon 2010).   In his seven rules for sustainability, Condon emphasizes the need to dramatically rethink our urban communities  from the ground up, and to substantively reinvest in technologies such as trolley buses and streetcar networks  that offer the potential for an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.   Condon is not the only urban designer advocating broad change in the structure and functioning of North  American communities.  Beatley (2000, 2009, 2014) also has concluded that for radical change to take place in  our use of fossil fuels for energy, and our capacity for resilience, we will need to alter many of the core attributes  and functions of our communities.  Luckily for us, it’s not entirely a new approach to city planning, but often a  return to older, proven ways of living, working and surviving.  In preparing for coming changes in the  environment, nothing is off the table.  Scientists, professionals and decision-makers must work collaboratively  with the public to assess the productivity and future benefit in current ways of living.  We must protect what we  consider invaluable, make existing structures and systems more resilient, adapt behavioural norms, and plan  now to build new stuff better.   Table 7-1 provides an additional summary of goals and objectives suggested by others that would support  community planning for resilience, transformation and sustainability.            CONDON’S SEVEN RULES    RULE 1.  Restore the streetcar city.    RULE 2.  Design an interconnected street system.    RULE 3.  Create and use local commercial services,   frequent transit, and schools within a   five-minute walk.    RULE 4.  Locate good jobs close to affordable   homes.    RULE 5.  Provide a diversity of housing types.    RULE 6.  Create a linked system of natural areas   and parks.    RULE 7.  Invest in lighter, greener, cheaper, and   smarter infrastructure.   (Condon 2010)   “We’ve already blown off ten years. We only have 40 years   left to reach our greenhouse gas target. I never thought   that I’d become a train nut—one of these guys with grey   hair who just goes cuckoo about trains. But I’ve become a   train nut in my later years because, after thinking about   this for a long time, I figured out that trains are a key part   of the answer.”    Patrick Condon (2010, p42), Canadian urban designer, planner and professor   FIGURE 7-2:  Vancouver street car.

Condon 2010; McVey et al. 2016; Nicol 2008; Thompson and Sorvig 2008).     6 | P a g e    7.2 CHANGING POLICY AND INSTRUMENTS    Regional and local planning will be the keystones in efforts to advance resilience, achieve positive transformation  in our communities, and promote sustainability throughout ecosystems, society, and economics.  Changes in  land use and in urban form can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, increase carbon sequestration, minimize  exposure to hazards, and improve the capacity for society and environments to withstand anticipated short- and  long-term changes in weather and in climate.  While we may not be able to stem the impacts of climate change,  we can alter social behaviour, reducing the pace and severity of the impact of anticipated environmental impacts,  and proactively planning for a future in which communities and industries are better positioned to respond.     Within regional and local governments there are a wide range of instruments that, with some changes, can be  used to enhance resilience to severe weather and to the changing climate and promote sustainability.  These  include provincial planning acts, environmental and protected area regulations, forest management policies,  shoreline management, town plans, comprehensive land use plans, zoning (including hazard zoning, setbacks  and easements), development agreements, clustered developments, special area plans (e.g., waterfronts,  commercial areas), as well as a range of financial tools that can encourage building retrofit, discourage  development in less than suitable areas, and reward builders who locate away from local hazards.     In most situations, planning activities should work across regional, community and neighbourhood scales,  responding to shared policies and insightful guidelines with implementable changes at the local level (Tables 7- 2, 7-3).  Where possible and practical, development of nested policy on management of land use and land cover  will facilitate effective change, implementation and enforcement in the many instruments that have direct and  indirect bearing on how we plan, design, construct, operate and decommission assets in the built environment.   Where science is still playing catch-up or has difficulties in projecting in absolute terms detailed information on  the maximum scope of change or on the timing for change, planning should employ precaution to ensure the  greatest degree of protection for human society, the lowest possible degree of residual risk, and the broadest  potential to seize new opportunities as they present themselves.   PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE   “The precautionary principle (or precautionary   approach) to risk management states that if an   action or policy has a suspected risk of causing   harm to the public, or to the environment, in the   absence of scientific consensus (that the action or   policy is not harmful), the burden of proof that it is   not harmful falls on those taking an action that may   or may not be a risk.   The principle is used by policy makers to justify   discretionary decisions in situations where there is   the possibility of harm from making a certain   decision (e.g. taking a particular course of action)   when extensive scientific knowledge on the matter   is lacking.  The principle implies that there is a social   responsibility to protect the public from exposure   to harm, when scientific investigation has found a   plausible risk. These protections can be relaxed   only if further scientific findings emerge that   provide sound evidence that no harm will result.”   (Wikipedia:    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precautionary_principle ).

A major contributing factor   to the difficulties with the decision-  making is the integral complexity of   ecological and social systems. “   (Golden et al. 2015, p410)      TABLE 7-3:  Checklist of changes needed in regional and local land use policy instruments (Adapted from Gibbs and Hill 2011).

Key goals for  planning efforts aimed at advancing resilience include (as adapted from Beatley 2009):   • Use a multi-scaled, long-term approach:  Planning processes must confront immediate needs, but must also  address longer-term impacts to ensure that decisions taken today do not restrict future options.  Planning  must take a nested approach, where local actions are in concert with broader policy and plans    • Solicit perspectives and values from all players:  Planning for adaptation will have its greatest success when  shared vision, perspectives and values have been documented.     • Plan for readiness, response and recovery:  Early preparation for extreme conditions (e.g., severe weather,  unanticipated flooding, and/or prolonged drought) will avoid damage, reduce the costs of recovery and  promote planning for a future in which opportunities associated with a changed environment result in  economic growth and individual well-being.     • Locate critical facilities and structures away from high risk areas:  Critical infrastructure, industrial and  commercial facilities, and homes will withstand extreme events and creeping changes if they are sited well.     • Plan for, design and construct resilient homes and buildings:  Passive survivability relies on local capacity  to withstand damage to structures and/or the loss of essential services without needing immediate external  intervention.    • Plan for, design and construct resilient public infrastructure:  Emphasis in regional and urban planning  should be on the creation of functional redundancy within public utilities (e.g., water supply, stormwater  and wastewater collection, treatment and disposal, energy distribution, transportation, communication).   • Protect, enhance and restore local ecosystems and cultural landscapes:  Natural systems need protection,  restoration and enhancement if the benefits they offer to mitigation and adaptation are to be realized.  Early  assessment of threats to cultural landscapes allows consideration of all plausible options for protection or  relocation.  New development should respect community cultural norms.    • Strive for long-term sustainability for ecosystems, communities, industries, and individuals:  Many of the  goals for sustainable living support the needs for a prepared, resilient, functioning society.  At a time when  dramatic changes may be required, changes that support sustainable living will result in short-term gains  and long-term prosperity.     • Promote a diverse economy:  A diverse economic base improves the capacity for the private sector to  recover from devastating single events, or from a downturn in any one sector.  Diverse local economies also  support locally sourced and distributed food, reducing dependencies on regional transportation systems  during times of crisis.    • Promote social resilience by encouraging social networks and improving institutions:  In difficult times,  communities rely upon relationships, volunteer activities and support networks.  Friendship contributes to  recovery from harm.  Support buffers the impact of damages.  Recovery is aided when many hands assist in  the work.       BASICS FOR A RESILIENCY FRAMEWORK   • Ensure current science and adaptation tools are   available to local and regional decision-makers.   • Engage citizens in planning, and in volunteer   participation in adaptation efforts   • Mainstream adaptation in provincial land use   planning instruments and municipal town plans.   • Require continual assessment of hazards    • Enhance readiness and response to disaster   • Reduce energy demand   • Limit urban sprawl and unsustainable development   practices   • Promote green/blue urbanism   • Protect natural and cultural heritage   • Alter building standards   • Ensure resiliency in critical infrastructure   • Plan for rising water   LOW CARBON RESILIENCE   Low carbon resilience (LCR) refers to climate change   strategies that integrate and achieve co-benefits   between efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions   (mitigation) and planning intended to reduce our   vulnerabilities to the impacts of climate change.  (Nichol   and Harford 2016, p1)/   Historically, greenhouse gas reduction (climate change   mitigation) and building resilience to climate change   impacts (adaptation) have been approached as separate   processes. Combining these strategies can achieve co-  benefits and save time and money. Municipalities are   moving forward on both adaptation and mitigation   planning, and we have a limited window of opportunity   in which to implement low carbon resilience to avoid   the risk of both building in vulnerability to climate   change impacts and inadvertently increasing emissions.     SFU/ACT 2017, p10     9 | P a g e    Until recently, much of the dialogue on climate adaptation has been at the regional, provincial/territorial and/or  national scale.  However, effective action towards enhancing resilience in communities will largely be the results  of actions by elected officials, by staff and by community organizations, private sector organizations and  individuals.     Specific activities to achieve the goals and objectives that support resilience can include;   • enactment of policies that encourage resilience and support sustainability;   • mapping local hazards and levels of risk;   • protection or relocation of critical infrastructure;   • protection or relocation of valued assets of natural heritage and cultural landscapes;   • reassessment of trends in demographics and land use;   • promotion of green and blue urbanism;   • encouragement for infill and brownfield development and discouragement of urban sprawl;   • promotion of resilient architecture and fast-tracking for retrofitting of existing buildings and systems;   • promotion of innovation in public transit and in walkable community design;   • protection and enhancement for urban canopies;   • planning and design that anticipates changes in freshwater and marine water levels;   • creation of open spaces suitable for enhanced public use and for festivals that encourage social interaction  and promote neighbourhood support systems;   • partnerships with local businesses, schools and colleges to broaden capacity and support innovation;   • support for locally sourced food;   • enhanced disaster response systems, and    • designated time intervals for the timing and scope of plan review.                   A VISION FOR RESILIENT CITIES:   “Such cities would be capable of withstanding   severe shock without either immediate chaos or   permanent harm.  Designed in advance to   anticipate, weather, and recover from the impacts   of natural or terrorist hazards, resilient cities   would be built on principles derived from past   experience with disasters in urban areas.  While   they might bend from hazard forces, they would   not break. Composed of networked social   communities and lifeline systems, resilient cities   would become stronger by adapting to and   learning from disasters. …”   “Resilient cities are constructed to be strong and   flexible, rather than brittle and fragile.  Their   lifeline systems of roads, utilities, and other   support facilities are designed to continue   functioning in the face of rising water, high winds,   shaking ground, and terrorist attacks.  Their new   development is guided away from known high   hazard areas, and their vulnerable existing   development is relocated to safe areas.  Their   buildings are constructed or retrofitted to meet   code standards based on hazard threats.  Their   natural environmental protective systems are   conserved to maintain valuable hazard mitigation   functions. Finally, their governmental, non-  governmental and private sector organizations   are prepared with up-to-date information about   hazard vulnerability and disaster resources, are   linked with effective communication networks,   and are experienced in working together.”    (Godschalk 2003, p.136-137)      The Climate Atlas of Canada combines climate science, mapping and storytelling to bring the global issue   of climate change closer to home for Canadians. It is designed to inspire local, regional, and national action   that will let us move from risk to resilience.    In a series of research papers on Calgary and Edmonton, the Prairie Climate Centre outlines steps that   communities can take to move towards climate resilient cities.     https://climateatlas.ca/building-climate-resilient-city    https://climateatlas.ca/building-climate-resilient-city   10 | P a g e    7.3 CONSERVING OUR NATURAL HERITAGE   Natural environments are increasingly recognized for the many important roles they play in mitigating  greenhouse gas emissions, and in minimizing the impacts of a changing climate on human society.  The natural  heritage of natural environments and human settlements in Canada can play a significant role in sequestering  carbon, improving air and water quality and in buffering communities from the effects of sea-level rise,  inundation, and extremes of heat, cold, wind and precipitation.  Yet throughout Canada, too much of our natural  heritage has already been destroyed or impacted by human activities on both the land and the water.     All ecosystems (aquatic, terrestrial, marine) will be affected in some way by the changing climate.  In most of  Canada, scientists have as yet been unable to anticipate the scope and pace of anticipated changes but are  concerned that stress from shifts in climate and weather may detrimentally affect resilience and sustainability in  species, habitats and systems.  Within local communities, natural heritage assets may need additional attention  to protection, conservation and enhancement to offset the coming environmental change.  In addition to  national and provincial parks and protected areas, many municipalities are now moving to establish Natural  Heritage Systems that recognize the diverse values society reaps from enhancing, sustaining and connecting  small and large areas of the natural environment and from ensuring that natural processes continue to function.     Ecosystem based approaches to adaptation to climate change are cropping up all over the world, from dune  management in New Zealand to enhance protection from coastal hazards (Dahm and Bergin 2005) to the role  of beaver in restoring sustainability in American watersheds (Pollock et al. 2015).  Efforts may be national,  regional, or provincial in scope and application, or may be the result of efforts by dedicated local volunteers  working to protect dunes, beaches, wetlands and urban forests.  Existing protected areas are seen now to  provide valuable knowledge on the mechanisms for integrated management of natural and human systems  (Lemieux et al. 2010).  New protected areas offer additional opportunities to conserve forest canopy cover,  protect special habitats (e.g., wetlands, salt marshes), and ensure that ecosystem functions and connectivity  continue.     Throughout Canada, cities such as Vancouver and Toronto, have initiated programs to assess, enhance and  sustain Natural Heritage Systems as integral elements of land use planning, and to ensure that the cities accrue  the maximum benefits offered by natural environments to mitigation of greenhouse gases and sheltering from  anticipated severe weather, altered temperature regimes and  changes in precipitation.       NATURAL HERITAGE refers to natural sites or   natural areas that have outstanding value to   science, conservation or natural beauty, including   ecosystems, species and habitats, as well as   physical features and systems.  Conservation and   management of natural heritage recognizes that   which has been inherited from past generations,   maintained and enhanced in the present and   bestowed upon future generations    A NATURAL HERITAGE SYSTEM is comprised of   natural heritage features and areas, as well as the   linkages intended to support connectivity (at the   regional or local scale) and the structures and   processes necessary to maintain biological and   geological diversity and natural functions.   ECOSYSTEM-BASED ADAPTATION:  is a   “complementary approach to other types of   climate change adaptation - emphasizes the   protection of biodiversity, the restoration of   ecosystem functions and the sustainable use of   resources to help nature and people adapt to   climate change”. (GOV/CAN/PARKS 2013, p3)   ROLES FOR PARKS AND PROTECTED AREAS    • Protecting safe havens for wildlife: helping   plants, animals and their habitats adapt;    • Working with partners to connect and restore   landscapes and seascapes;    • Protecting ecosystem services and supporting   healthy communities;    • Building knowledge and understanding of   impacts and solutions; and    • Inspiring and engaging Canadians.

Mercer Clarke   “Canada has a magnificent natural  heritage that defines our country in  the eyes of Canadians and the world  community. “   Karen Keenleyside, Chair, Canadian Parks   Council Climate Change Working Group     11 | P a g e    7.3.1 BLUE CARBON SHORES   At the margins of the lakes, rivers and coasts, where the land meets the water, riverine wetlands, salt marshes  and seagrass beds, some of the world’s most efficient carbon sinks have been accumulating and sequestering  carbon for centuries.  Even without the anticipated changes to climate many of these valuable ecosystems have  already been impacted by exploitation, dredging and infilling, diminished by increasing levels of contaminants  and nutrients, and/or transformed to other land and water uses.  As sea levels rise, coastal salt marshes may be  trapped against coastal bluffs or aspects of the built environment and have nowhere to go.  Throughout North  America, there is considerable concern for the future viability of wetlands, salt marshes and seagrass beds.     In addition to sustaining their carbon sequestering properties, blue carbon shores support critical habitat for  ensuring resilience to extreme events, ice and wave damage, and sea level rise.  Protection and enhancement of  these habitats can directly and indirectly support adaptation initiatives such as (NROC 2015):    • enhanced protection for nearshore roads and other infrastructure located in areas at risk of inundation  and worsening storm conditions exacerbated by sea-level rise;   • reduction of vulnerabilities of communities to storm surge, wave damage, and flooding; and   • improvement in non-point source water quality through interception and removal of nutrients and  other contaminants.   Between 340,000 and 980,000 hectares of blue carbon habitat are estimated to be destroyed every year (The  Blue Carbon Initiative: Available at http://thebluecarboninitiative.org/blue-carbon/).   When degraded or lost,  these habitats can themselves become significant resources for greenhouse gas emissions.         WETLANDS are small or large areas of land where the   water table is at or near the surface, or where the land   is covered by shallow water for much of the growing   season or long enough to promote soil development   and support the types of plant and animal   communities adapted to saturated conditions.   Wetlands in Canada include peatlands, bogs, fens,   swamps and marshes   TIDAL SALT MARSHES are wetlands located in   sheltered areas of the coast.  Salt marsh flora can   include a range of grasses, sedges and rushes,   providing habitat and nutrients for a range of fauna.    Salt marshes act as sinks for many pollutants and are   a first line of coastal defence against the destructive   forces of storms.  Salt marsh soils are exceptional   carbon sinks.     SEAGRASSES are underwater marine flowering plants   that root in the sediments and produce flowers,   pollen and seeds below the surface of the coastal   ocean.  They rely on the light that penetrates the   water column for growth and can be badly impacted   by suspended silt.  Seagrass meadows can range in   size and exist in waters as deep as 90 metres.  It is   estimated that while seagrasses cover only 0.2% of   the global ocean, they store as much as 20% of   oceanic blue carbon. Throughout much of Canada’s   coasts, seagrasses are poorly mapped.   Image Credits: C. Mercer Clarke   http://thebluecarboninitiative.org/blue-carbon/   12 | P a g e    7.3.2 RESPECTING NATURAL FEATURES AND CULTURAL FORMS   Integration of human settlement with natural systems will require changes to existing norms for  development and a departure from approaches such as strip development along major roads  (Figure 7-3).    In New South Wales Australia (GOV/Austral/NSW 2008) and New Zealand (GOV/NZ 2009),  governments are developing urban design guidelines that preserve the unique cultural  characteristics of coastal and inland villages and towns, while promoting progressive principles for  urban planning and management. Chief amongst the changes recommended for development  planning and design are:    • ensure important ecosystems and natural features (e.g., beaches, dunes) are protected  and, where needed, enhanced;   • use setbacks and other development instruments to prevent development and use from  encroaching on aquatic and marine habitats, shoreline and bankside vegetation and other  natural elements;   • protect and enhance urban canopy;   • move away from linear, multiple access approaches to development to cluster lots and  retain land for other purposes (e.g., forest cover, wetlands, agriculture);   • integrate sustainable management of natural features as components of settlement that  contribute important services (e.g., stormwater management, shelter, water supply  protection);   • provide inland area for migration of natural features as sea levels rise;    • avoid subdivision of lands that are not suitable for development (e.g., backshore areas,  dunes, eroding bluffs, wetlands, areas of steep topography);   • respect the cultural and historic values of communities, and protect historic and important  views and vistas;   • ensure pedestrian friendly connections are maintained and enhanced in all new  development;   • align roads to follow natural topography to minimize the need for cut and fill operations;   • maintain public open space and protect public access to the shoreline, including marine,  river and lake shores;   • promote low impact development and infiltration measures for stormwater management;    • integrate services and utilities into the natural landscape to reduce visual impact;    • avoid extensive street parking, by clustering parking in small lots;    • reinforce visual and physical linkages to shorelines and to other natural features; and   • define municipal/rural boundaries and expectations to limit development creep into  agricultural areas and forests.       THIS   NOT   THIS   FIGURE 7-3:  Alternative approaches to coastal development   that secure greenspace and create quality neighbourhoods   (as opposed to highway strip development).       13 | P a g e    7.4 GREENING THE LANDSCAPE   Throughout North America, most urban communities reflect a style of planning and  management that is often wasteful of land and resources.  Few have made serious  commitment to setting ecological limits or objectives, and many consume  disproportionally large areas of land for residential development and urban growth  (Beatley 2000).  Our communities sprawl across the landscape, destroying sensitive  habitats, consuming farmlands and forests, and creating large demands for energy,  and water.  We have built low density towns and cities where public transit is difficult  to achieve efficiently and economically, and where generated wastes are costly to  recover, to treat and to dispose.  Global warming and the associated environmental  changes that threaten our communities and our industry are but the latest  consequences of the demands of human society for conscienceless living.     In 2014, seven out of ten Canadians made their home in a major city or in the closely  connected suburban areas (Figure 7-4).  One in three lived in either Toronto, Montreal  or Vancouver.  It is not by accident that each of these three cities had their origins on  a freshwater or marine coast.  These were places from which goods, services and  people could travel widely to other towns and other nations.  Coastal living, while  undeniably the result of diverse resources and economic opportunities, has also  prospered because human society has an emotional attachment to the places where  the land meets the water.  Canada is not unique in the distribution of its population.   Coastal living is evident throughout the globe, where half the population lives within  60 km of the sea, and 75% of all large cities are located on the coast (UNEP 2016).  As  the planet warms, those living and working on the coasts will be among the first to  experience major threats to infrastructure and to life style.  Seas are already rising,  and storms are becoming increasingly frequent and more intense.     While the challenges posed by the changing environment are diverse in scope and may be difficult to resolve, cities and  towns can play significant roles in reducing energy demands, lowering greenhouse gas emissions, sequestering more  carbon, and making buildings and activities more resilient to impending impacts.  Land cover change and forest reduction  has contributed as much as 25% of greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere.  We will need to adjust our vision of  community living, our approach to planning and design, and the speed with which we implement change.  North American  cities have more than twice the greenhouse gas emissions of European cities.  Urban dwellers in Canada consume more  than twice as much water as households in Europe.     The future for Canadian cities will rely on connectivity, resilience and sustainability.  Unlike the Post WW II era, when  North Americans used access to a personal automobile to conquer the distance between home, work and services, the  new urban dweller will need affordable housing accessible to public transit.  As electronic connectivity grows, the spatial  boundaries and distances between provinces and nations blur, and communication linkages become increasingly more  important to trade, to commerce and to individual well-being.  Environmental changes will need to be addressed, not  conquered, by innovation and adaptation.  To meet the coming challenges and opportunities, cities and towns in Canada,  and the industries that support them, must become greener, more resilient and more sustainable centres of well-being.     FIGURE 7-4:  Changes in Canada's urban populations 1851-2001 (Statistics Canada).     14 | P a g e    7.4.1 URBAN HEAT ISLANDS   Urban areas are known to experience air and surface temperatures that are  higher than those occurring in nearby rural areas (Figure 7-5).  In large cities,  higher temperatures can also increase the concentrations of contaminants in the  air, further exacerbating the impacts on health and well-being.  The  preponderance of hard surfaces (e.g., concrete, brick, asphalt), the lack of green  space (e.g., grass, trees, shrubs), and the lack of open water (e.g., lakes, ponds,  streams); collectively contribute to an increase in heat absorption, and a decrease  in evaporative cooling (GOV/CAN/Health 2011a, b).  Increasing the reflectivity of  urban hard surfaces, and enhancing natural spaces through expansion of urban  forests, parks and open spaces and green roofs, can assist in reducing urban heat  island effects (Figure 7-6).                                 FIGURE 7-5:  Urban heat island effects created when cities become warmer than   neighbouring rural areas because pavements, roofs, buildings and other infrastructure   remove sources of shade and retain heat (Image Credit: Wikipedia, Public Domain).   FIGURE 7-6:  Vegetation protects soils, improves infiltration and moderates local climate   (adapted from Thompson and Sorvig 2008).     15 | P a g e    7.4.2 LAND COVER RATIOS   Change in land cover can have a significant contribution to global warming and  exacerbate the scope of knock-on changes experienced by the environment and  by society.  It has been estimated that carbon dioxide emissions from land cover  changes contribute as much as 20% of annual global emissions of greenhouse  gases.     In the natural environment, plants and soils sequester the carbon dioxide that is  absorbed through photosynthesis.  When vegetation is removed or changed  and/or when soils are disturbed, the stored carbon dioxide, together with other  greenhouse gases (e.g., methane and nitrous oxide), re-enters the atmosphere.   Plants decompose, releasing carbon and methane.  Without shelter from the sun,  soils warm, creating inhospitable conditions for micro-organisms, which die and  decompose, releasing their stored carbon.  Burning plant material, and/or the  consumption of plant and animal material also releases carbon.  Land clearing can  also detrimentally affect the physical condition of soils, contributing to erosion  and to the leaching of nutrients and other entrained contaminants (e.g.,  pesticides, heavy metals), leading to deterioration in the quality of local surface  and groundwater, and increasing the stresses on aquatic species.     Deforestation in northern climates can affect atmospheric and local conditions,  changing the amount of heat radiated back to the atmosphere, reducing local  transpiration rates and contributing to warmer conditions.  At a time when  Canada has committed to reductions in our annual contributions of greenhouse  gas emissions, all types of deforestation, whether from forest sector clear-cutting  or loss of urban canopy, will directly affect our ability to sequester carbon and  increase contributions to radiative forcing (a change in the balance between the  sun’s warming of our atmosphere and emissions of radiation from the Earth that  act to cool the atmosphere).  Increasing urban density, sprawling cities, and aging  infrastructure will compound the effects of climate change, restricting water  infiltration and altering hydrological capacity (Figures 7-7 and 7-8), reducing our  capacity to withstand extreme weather events, and exacerbating damages and  threats to human well-being.             LAND USE is how the land is used by humans (e.g., urbanization, agriculture,   transportation, mining)   LAND COVER refers to the kind of vegetation, or the type of built environment that   cover the land (e.g., forests, wetlands, barrens, exposed soils and bedrock, impermeable   surfaces).     URBAN SPRAWL is low density, automobile dependent development that takes place   beyond the edge of most commercial services and at distance from employment, and   that has limited constraints to continuing outward expansion from urban core areas.     FIGURE 7-7:  Deforestation in urban development contributes to the release of carbon dioxide   and other greenhouse gases to the atmosphere.  (Image Credit: C. Mercer Clarke).     16 | P a g e    In the four hundred years since European  colonization of Canada, changes have been wrought  on the landscape through agriculture, forestry,  mining, transportation and urbanization.  While the  more populated southern areas of the country have  demonstrated the most significant change in land  cover and land use, expanding human use of the  landscape is changing conditions even in sparsely  populated areas.     In recent years, a number of agencies and researchers  have attempted to identify limits for sustainable land  cover change within watersheds (Figure 7-8).   Intended primarily to conserve biodiversity, and to  improve surface and nearshore water quality, the  guidelines offer minimal targets for regional and local  planners responsible for decisions related to land  development and resource extraction (GOV/CAN/EC  2004, 2005; Degnbol 2002; Mercer Clarke 2010;  Mercer Clarke et al. 2008) (Table 7-4).  These targets  could assist in promoting conservation of natural and  urban forests, in reducing impermeable surfaces and  in protecting and sheltering waterways and  shorelines.

While the past 50 years has seen many new  developments in urban and rural planning, and in the design and operation of  infrastructure, few initiatives have made significant gains in mainstreaming  ecological criteria as an integral element of planning and design processes.  As  the demand grows for more economically sustainable communities and  industries, the greatest potential is achieved when working within environmental  constraints and capitalizing on the assets and supporting capacity of the natural  environment.     With the advent of a changing climate, and increasingly severe weather patterns,  the value inherent in natural systems is coming to the fore.  In addition to the  contributions made to mitigation of GHG emissions and to the sequestering of  carbon, natural areas can offer protection and shelter, reducing the impact of  periods of severe heat or cold, dampening the effects of high winds, and  providing protection from storm waves.  Increasingly, scientists are  demonstrating the economic as well as cultural values in the creation and  maintenance of high quality natural environments within community boundaries.    Green urbanism, as a departure from old ways of thinking about cities and  communities, expands urban policy and practice to encompass forms of living and  settlement that are more ecologically responsible (Figure 7-9).  As a philosophy  for moving forward, for planning cities resilient enough to adapt to changing  environmental conditions, green urbanism offers significant potential, especially  when applied across scales of development planning, construction and operation  that include close attention to greening infrastructure and greening buildings.     Green infrastructure is a term that was initially applied only to urban green space  such as parks and natural areas.  More recently, green infrastructure has  expanded to include the network of open spaces and ecological processes that  contribute to the well-being of the human population.     Green infrastructure differs from traditional approaches to land use planning to  provide for an enhanced community structure in which a network of natural  systems can enrich social well-being, while ensuring benefits to the economic  foundations of the community.  Green infrastructure promotes new approaches in  planning and design for stormwater management, for reductions in hard surfaces,  and for the development of functioning ecosystems within community boundaries.         GREENBELT: A policy and land use designation used to retain areas of largely   undeveloped, wild, or agricultural land, surrounding or neighbouring urban areas.     GREENWAY:  Similar designation of lands with a linear character that may run through   an urban area. (Wikipedia 2016)   GREEN URBANISM is an evolving approach to urban planning that promotes cities that   are ‘dramatically more ecological in design and functioning, and that have ecological   limits at their core.’ (Beatley 2000)   GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE is comprised of the interconnected natural areas, systems and   ecological processes that provide clean water, air quality and wildlife habitat, as well as   other benefits to people and to the environment.  Green infrastructure sustains a   community’s social, economic, and environmental health, and contributes to the safety,   protection and well-being of its residents.     (Benedict 2006, Green Infrastructure Center. Available at http://www.gicinc.org/index.htm ).   FIGURE 7-9:  The pillars of green urbanism (Adapted from Lehmann 2010)   http://www.gicinc.org/index.htm   18 | P a g e    Green urbanism and green infrastructure are more than Green  Wash, or Green Painting, terms used to describe increased  effort in site planting (e.g., street trees, ornamental beds), that  improve the aesthetic quality of an area, but are created with  little attention paid to other criteria, and as a result often serve  little other useful purpose.  Much can be done to advance  implementation of green infrastructure through immediate  appropriation of public spaces such as the grounds of public  and private buildings and other underutilized areas (e.g.,  schools, colleges, universities, public administration offices,  utility corridors).  Redesign and reuse of these areas as integral  elements of green infrastructure can demonstrate the benefits  and provide inspiration for use of these principles in other  areas.  Green infrastructure functions best when individual  landscapes and systems become part of a larger network such  as a greenbelt (Figure 7-10, GOV/CAN/NCC 2013).     The linkages between individual elements provide for  important opportunities for human use of the environment  and open corridors for wildlife movement.       Cities that have vested their future in green urbanism have committed to policies  that (adapted from Beatley 2000):   • strive to reduce their ecological footprint, to live within the limit of local and  regional ecosystems, and to acknowledge the host of ways the decisions made  in their city can affect the quality of the environment and life of other places,  and contribute to the overall health of the planet;    • overcome traditional views of a city as a space filled with built environments,  and encourage the retention, protection and development of nature within  city boundaries (e.g., urban forests, day-lighted streams, green rooftops);   • seek balance in the input and output demands of city life, working to connect  urban systems (e.g., wastewater collection, treatment and disposal) with  useful application of outputs (e.g., biogas for heating) so that systems can feed  off each other, and potential gains can be made in reducing, reusing and  recycling the by-products of human settlement and industry;   • strive towards local and regional self-sufficiency in activities such as the  production of food, the creation of jobs, the generation of power, the  consumption of water, and the disposal of wastes;    • facilitate and encourage more sustainable, healthful lifestyles; and emphasize  attaining a high quality of life for residents through the creation of livable  neighbourhoods and communities that are emotionally uplifting, aesthetically  inspirational, and that provide for the safe and affordable housing of all  members of society in environments that are socially supportive;   • seek balance in the input and output demands of city life, working to connect  urban systems (e.g., wastewater collection, treatment and disposal) with  useful application of outputs (e.g., biogas for heating) so that systems can feed  off each other, and potential gains can be made in reducing, reusing and  recycling the by-products of human settlement and industry; and    • strive towards local and regional self-sufficiency in activities such as the  production of food, the creation of jobs, the generation of power, the  consumption of water, and the disposal of wastes.   FIGURE 7-10:  The Ottawa greenbelt (Image Credit: National Capital Commission, used with permission).     19 | P a g e    BLUE URBANISM   Cities mindful of the role waterways play in providing potable water, managing  stormwater, and enhancing biodiversity are increasingly interested in blue  urbanism, whose focus is on protecting natural water resources, even in urban  areas.  Interest is growing in the creation of Bluebelts within urban and  developing areas (Ontario Friends of the Greenbelt. Available at:  http://www.greenbelt.ca/bluebelt).    Communities perched on the edge of the sea (or the Great Lakes, or any other  waterway) are pursuing the application of bluebelts to protect and enhance  shorelines, and to provide continuous linkages along their waterfronts for  wildlife as well as for humans.  Bluebelts can also play a significant role in the  protection of sources for potable water, in enhancing wetlands and in protecting  shorelines, beaches, dunes and backshore vegetation, all of which assists in  sheltering -community assets from changing water levels and storm impact.            BLUE URBANISM is guided by the principal understanding that all communities have a   direct connection to the water resources, and that human choices concerning the   consumption of materials, energy, and food will impact aquatic and marine organisms   and ecosystems and ultimately return to influence our own health and well-being.  Blue   urban cities consciously acknowledge that their ecological footprints extend beyond   their immediate communities, and that there is a terrestrial as well as an aquatic   hinterland that supports and sustains them.  As such, policies are carefully considered   regarding their impact on oceans and waterways (adapted from Beatley 2014).   BLUEBELT: A policy and/or land use designation that includes watersheds, surface   water corridors, and/or shorelines intended to link water resources, waterways and   coastlines in urban or suburban areas.  Bluebelts can be used as conservation and/or   recreation tools to protect biodiversity, secure potable water sources, improve   stormwater management, and provide access to water resources for humans and   wildlife.

Mercer Clarke   http://www.greenbelt.ca/bluebelt   20 | P a g e    7.4.4 ENHANCING URBAN FORESTS   In most communities in Canada, trees provide significant benefit to the aesthetic and cultural landscape.   For the last few decades, throughout North America, there has been a downward trend in natural areas  and forest cover.  In the United States, in the period between 1982 and 1997, the amount of land devoted  to urban and built-up uses (i.e., industry, transportation) has increased by more than 34% (City of Toronto  2013a).  In Canada, while much of the forestry industry has moved to sustainable forest management, some  unsustainable logging continues.  And in cities, existing tree cover can be reduced by development pressure,  removal of trees from private property, and removal of trees to control invasive pests and diseases (Figure  7-11).     Urban trees can also be stressed by restrictions to water and nutrients and impacted by wind and road salt.   At a time when the urban canopy in most communities will have an increased role in sequestering carbon,  sheltering from winds and reducing demands for energy for heating and cooling, Canadian urban trees will  face escalating changes to expected seasonal growing conditions, altering plant hardiness zones and  compromising their longevity.                        URBAN FORESTS include the trees and tree environments   found on public and private lands within large and small   communities, and include cultivated landscapes, natural   areas and managed forests.    URBAN FORESTRY is the management of treed   environments to provide a wide array of economic,   environmental and social services as a key asset of liveable,   healthy and vibrant communities.   TREE CANOPY COVER is the North American standard for   assessing the performance of urban forests.  Canopy cover   is based on how much ground area is covered by tree leaf   canopies when viewed from the air.   FIGURE 7-11: Existing land use practices can restrict opportunities for tree growth in urban areas (Image Credit: City   of Toronto, used with permission).   FIGURE 7-12: Minimized surface parking to maximize space for vegetation   (Image Credit: GOV/CAN/CMHC 2013)     21 | P a g e    Trees within urban and rural communities improve the livability, increase civic pride and  contribute significantly to the quality of life for residents.  Trees are good for business.   Shoppers stay longer, pay up to 10% more for goods and services, and overall spend more  money in commercial districts lined by street trees.   Communities can be enhanced by  tree cover, encouraging people to stop and visit.  Generally, communities with green space  and vegetation are seen to have more shopping, a higher standard of life and less crime  (Duinker et al. 2015; GOV/CAN/BC 2008).     Trees slow the production of ground-level ozone, filter particulates from the air, and  absorb air-borne pollutants such as sulphur dioxide.  A single mature tree can produce  enough oxygen for two people. Tree canopy can also reduce the costs of stormwater  management, intercepting rainfall, and reducing the quantity of stormwater to be handled  by 2% for every 5% of canopy cover.  By reducing heat on paved areas, shade trees increase  the life of pavements by 10-25 years.  In neighbourhoods with significant canopy cover,  crime rates are lower, there is less domestic violence, slower traffic speeds, and reduced  driver stress.   Property values are also generally higher in these areas and neighbourhood  noise levels are reduced.    Environmentally, even in cities, trees increase biodiversity by providing food and habitat  for a range of urban species.  Tree roots protect stream banks, reducing the potential for  erosion and sedimentation, while shading the water.  Trees also conserve and enhance soil  productivity by enhancing biological activity through support for insects, bacteria and  fungi, which in turn can improve the ability of soils to uptake water and nutrients.  Some  species of trees can also remove heavy metals and some toxins from contaminated soils  and groundwater.  In some situations, trees that were badly situated, poorly maintained,  or were the wrong species for the location, can prove to be a nuisance.  Tree canopy and  tree roots can interfere with electrical distribution systems, cable and phone lines.  Sap,  leaves and other droppings can coat vehicles, and pathways.  The pollens from some tree  species can aggravate human allergies.     SOCIAL BENEFITS OF URBAN FORESTS   • The net cooling effect of a young, healthy tree is equivalent to ten room   sized air conditioners operating 20 hours a day   • Shaded buildings, and air cooled by tree transpiration, can reduce energy   needed for cooling by up to 70%.     • Trees slow the wind and can reduce energy needed for heating by 30%.     • Trees planted as wind breaks reduce the need to plow roads & parking   lots.     • Trees can attenuate stormwater, provide habitat and improve air quality   • Property values are higher in treed commercial and residential areas   • Trees are good for business as people linger in shaded areas, and are   willing to pay more for goods and services in those locations   • Trees provide psychological and health benefits to rural and urban   dwellers and workers   (Image Credits: C Mercer Clarke)   34 metric tonnes of particulate matter (dust, smog, soot) are removed and 20,000 metric   tonnes of carbon dioxide are absorbed from the air every year by Vancouver’s urban   forest. (City of Vancouver)   Toronto’s urban forest has a value of $7 Billion, provides the equivalent of over $60   Million in ecological services each year and offers multiple social and economic benefits   to all citizens of Toronto   Carbon storage by Toronto’s urban forest is equivalent to: (City of Toronto 2013a)   • the amount of carbon emitted in the city in 29 days or the    • annual carbon emissions from 733,000 automobiles or the    • annual carbon emissions from 367,900 single family houses.     22 | P a g e    In Canada, in recent times, severe weather events (e.g., high winds, ice storms) have  resulted in damage to structures as branches break or trees fall.  In areas subject to  wildfire, poorly situated trees can increase vulnerabilities.  With proper species and  placement management, and better maintenance, most of the nuisance factors  associated with urban trees can be avoided.     We are losing urban forests because of:   • new development on greenfield sites, and infill development in the urban core;   • the replacement of parkland with active recreational areas;   • the interference of poorly planted and/or maintained trees with utilities,  services, foundations;   • invasive pests and species, wildfires, wind and ice storms;   • drought and heat;   • single aged forests that succumb at the same time;   • removal of trees to reduce the potential for damage during severe weather;   • removal of trees for parking;   • removal of trees to open views and vistas; and because   • we are not replanting trees that die.    We may now see additional stresses on urban forests as the environment and growing  conditions alter.  Climate change is bringing hotter summers that stress new plantings  and increase the need for watering in urban areas.  Precipitation is becoming more  unpredictable, and even when cloudbursts occur, in urban areas water runs off before  much of it can infiltrate into the soil.  Along river channels and shorelines, tree cover  is threatened by both high and low water levels, increased bank erosion, and ice and  wind damage.   Milder winters are favourable for many tree diseases and insect pests,  and for the arrival of new species as ranges extend.  Unseasonably warm, or cold  springs can affect bud production and flowering.  Warmer temperatures can also  increase ground level ozone concentrations that damage leaves and slow growth  (Clean Air Partnership 2007). As growing seasons alter, plant hardiness changes,  forcing some species further north, and opening the range for new species.     In addition to watering during dry periods and protecting from early and late frosts,  managers can prepare existing urban forests for anticipated changes in environmental  conditions by (Figure 7-13):   • creating a database on existing tree conditions;   • revising the list of tree species more suitable to future conditions;   • planting multiple species to gain the best resilience to change;    • providing incentives for private tree maintenance to reduce the potential  for damage from wind and ice;    • stabilizing soils in areas vulnerable to erosion and landslides; and   • initiating tree replacement, improving tree soil conditions, and planting   more trees.    IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON URBAN FORESTS    • Warmer winters and longer growing seasons   • Changes in the seasonality of precipitation and extreme weather events   like drought and heavy rain   • Expanded ranges of insects and increased over-winter survival rates   • Increased frequency and severity of storm events (wind, ice, snow)   FIGURE 7-13: Employing structural soils in parking lot design provides benefits for both   vehicular parking and stormwater management.  In some cases, the gravel base course can   be optional, as structural soil is designed to be as strong as such bases. Structural soils also   provide greater soil volumes for tree root growth than soils in traditional parking lots.    (Adapted from GOV/CAN/BC 2010).     23 | P a g e    7.4.5 STREET TREES   Development of urban forest management plans can slow or even reverse trends in tree loss through the promotion of urban forests as integral components of other municipal  planning and management instruments (e.g., town plans, development bylaws, urban core, waterfront and open space plans).  Proper siting of trees, coupled with provisions  for sufficient soil and water can contribute much to the longevity of the urban canopy.  New tree selection and planting should be guided by the following (adapted from Tree  Trust and Bonestroo 2007, City of Toronto 2016), (Figures 7-14, 7-15; 7-16):   • allow sufficient space for continuous tree rows along streets to provide overlapping canopies (i.e., shade at least 50% of streets, sidewalks, and parking);   • as street width increases so should the size of the tree canopy as well as the width of the boulevard in which trees are planted (e.g., minimum 3 m);   • provide space to accommodate the tree’s mature structure and canopy without adversely affecting utilities, accessibility, or increasing potential damage from storms,    • creatively reduce street widths and add bump-outs, central medians, and traffic circles to provide increased flexibility in coordinating street tree and utility locations;   • create wider tree planting spaces (e.g., > 1.5m) to promote stronger root systems and reduce blowdowns and increase the depth of structured soil;   • plant trees in soils and microclimates most favorable to sustaining tree health and longevity, minimizing stress, and providing adequate moisture and sunlight;   • select species and locate trees to best provide  summer shade (east and west facades of buildings)  and to allow winter solar gain (south facades);    • consider plantings of tree copses in under-utilized  areas such as traffic circles;   • install conduits (sleeves) and/or removable sidewalk  panels over continuous utility vaults to  accommodate maintenance as well as future utilities  and avoid disturbing tree roots;    • avoid planting shallow-rooting species near  sidewalks, curbs, and pavement and provide  continuous open planting beds flush with grade  where practicable; and    • discourage the use of tree grates and encourage use  of permeable pavers and porous paving for  sidewalks and other surfaces to reduce stormwater  runoff and to irrigate trees and landscape.   As understanding grows on the value of urban forests to  enhancing urban resilience and promoting more  sustainable approaches to energy use, communities such  as the Cities of Toronto and Vancouver are investing in  inventories of urban tree condition, and in improvements  to practice for tree siting and tree planting.     Avoiding conflict with utilities, provision of nurturing soil  and water conditions, and selection of tree species  capable of withstanding changing environmental  conditions are key to enhancing urban canopy.

Mercer Clarke)     25 | P a g e    7.4.6 CHANGES TO GROWING SEASONS AND PLANT HARDINESS   The length of a growing season indicates the amount of time that plants have to grow in  any given year.  Plant hardiness zones are practical tools used to ascertain the species of  plants that are most suitable for your environment, based on the local growing season.   Recent examination of changes in climate for the period from 1951-2010 (Figure 7-17) has  determined that growing seasons across the nation have already changed considerably  from conditions experienced from 1951-1980.  As the planet continues to warm, the  growing season throughout Canada will continue to change, especially if rapid reductions  to global emissions of greenhouse gases are not achieved soon and emissions continue at  current rates throughout the world (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change:  Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5) (Figure 7-18).   Using the new data on the anticipated climate changes to seasonality and to extremes of  heat and cold, Natural Resources Canada has adjusted information on plant hardiness for  the country (Figure 7-19), and through its website provides additional information on the  projected new ranges for 6303 species of plants (Available at: (http://planthardiness.gc.ca).        GROWING SEASON   The growing season is the period during which weather conditions are   conducive to plant growth.  In Canada, growing seasons are calculated as the   number of days between the last occurrence of 0⁰C in spring and the first   occurrence of 0⁰C in fall.  The length of a growing season can also be limited   by other factors such as frost days, rainfall, and/or daylight hours.

Design standards, building codes,  construction and operational inspection, and the array of policies and instruments that compel participation play a  significant role in making structures, indeed all forms of development, safer, more resilient to change, and more  likely to be sustainable in the long term.  Building to last MAY require more inventive design, and the use of non- traditional materials and techniques, but it offers the highest potential to reduce costs associated with damage  repairs, retrofitting, and replacement.  Building to last can also improve the safety and well-being of society, reducing  stresses on human health, and improving productivity.   As early as the 1980s, countries in Europe began to adopt guidelines that set new levels for coastal development, in  anticipation of rising sea levels.  Building to last can also include the construction of permanently or temporarily  floating structures and communities, changes in foundation design to accommodate for thawing permafrost,  stronger roofs and walls, flood-proofing for lower floors, redundant systems for access and egress from buildings,  and for the uninterrupted provision of services (passive survivability).  Building to last requires reduction in the  energy footprint of the structure through both passive and active changes in siting, in the management of the natural  and the urban landscape, and in expectations for quality of life during difficult times.    The National Building Code of Canada 2015 (NBC) is developed by the Canadian Commission on Building and Fire Codes and published by the National Research Council.  The  National Building Code is used in concert with other National Model Codes (e.g., the National Fire Code, the National Plumbing Code and the National Energy Code for Buildings).   The NBC sets out the technical provisions for the design and construction of new buildings, and for the change of use, and demolition of existing buildings.  Included within the  Code are provisions for services and site works associated with these structures.  While the NBC is enforceable only on land owned by the Federal government, in most cases  it has been adopted by provincial, territorial and municipal governments (Table 7-5).  In some cases, local governments can also enact additional requirements for building  within their jurisdiction.      “Because infrastructure built in   current times is intended to   survive for decades to come, it   is important that adaptation   options for the changing   climate be developed today and   that future climate changes be   incorporated into infrastructure   design whenever possible.”   (Auld and MacIver. 2012, p265)   TABLE 7-5:  Canada-wide adoption of the National Building Code (adapted from Feltmate and Thistlethwaite 2012)   PROVINCE DEGREE OF ADOPTION OF NATIONAL BUILDING CODE   New Brunswick, Nova Scotia,   Manitoba, and Saskatchewan  Province-wide adoption of the National Building Code, National Fire Code and National Plumbing Code with some modifications and additions.

The Ontario Fire Code, in   particular, is significantly different from the National Fire Code. Ontario also references the Model National Energy Code for Buildings in its building code.   Quebec  Province-wide building and plumbing codes that are substantially the same as the National Building Code and National Plumbing Code, but with variations that are   primarily additions. Major municipalities adopt the National Fire Code.        29 | P a g e    7.5.1 DESIGN CODES AND STANDARDS    Because Canada is such a large country, with widely different climate patterns as well as  a range of expected seismic conditions, the National Building Code includes a  Supplementary Standard titled Climatic and Seismic Information for Building Design.   Based on historical data on weather patterns and climate collected by Environment and  Climate Change Canada, the Standard is intended only for application to buildings that  would normally be designed by engineers an d architects and is not necessarily applied to  home design and construction.  Under this Standard, architects and engineers must  address the following conditions (Feltmate and Thistlethwaite 2012):   1. January Design Temperature:  The building must be designed to maintain a pre- determined indoor temperature, requiring greater insulation in more northern  structures.    2. July Design Temperature:  The building must be designed to maintain a pre- determined indoor temperature.   3. Heating Degree Days: The rate of consumption of energy that is needed to keep  the indoor temperature of a small building at 21 °C when the outdoor  temperature is below 18 °C.   4. Snow Loads:  The roof of a building must support the greatest weight of snow  that is anticipated to accumulate upon it.    5. Annual Rainfall:  The amount of total yearly rainfall is used to determine the  wetness of the local climate.   6. Rainfall Intensity:  Roof drainage systems must carry all the rainfall from the most  intense precipitation event anticipated to occur.  In the NBC, this anticipated 15- minute rainfall is expected to be exceeded once in every 10 years.   7. One-day Rainfall: Roofs must withstand the weight of the volume of water  anticipated from a 1-in-50-year storm.    8. Driving Rain Wind Pressure:  The building design is expected to minimize  opportunities for water to enter the building envelope.    9. Wind Effects:  The structural and secondary components of all buildings must  withstand the pressures and suction caused by the strongest winds (1-in-50-year  storm) anticipated to blow at that location.    The process for reform of the National Building Code can be complicated and political,  ensuring that changes are not made often and only as needed.  While the provisions  within the Code can allow for requirements to change based on current weather,  incorporation of predicted future weather conditions (anticipated over the life of the  structure) can be more difficult to achieve.  At a time when society is shifting from an  understanding of weather and climate based on factual averaging of experienced  conditions to a predictive understanding of what weather and climate is likely to be in the  future, proactive changes to standards such as the NBC are badly needed.    PASSIVE SURVIVABILITY is the ability of a building to maintain critical life-  support conditions for its occupants if services such as power, heating fuel,   or water are lost for an extended period.     Many of the design elements and building features that would help reach   passive survivability are ones that we will need and want to adopt for energy   conservation and for sustainability and well-being benefits often associated   with green buildings (e.g., passive solar design, incorporation of natural   daylight, natural ventilation, rooftop photovoltaic panels and/or wind   turbines to supply electricity during power outages).  In some areas,   designing for passive survivability could include the rediscovery and return   to building vernacular and early wisdom found in older structures   throughout the country.  (Beatley 2009)   TABLE 7-6:  Basic mitigation and adaptation options for buildings   POTENTIAL IMPACTS   FROM CLIMATE CHANGE   AND DISASTER EVENTS   MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION   OPTIONS   • Increased demand on   energy resources   • Periods of deteriorating air   quality   • Improve insulation and efficiencies in   heating and cooling systems   • Locate new construction in sheltered areas   • Plant trees and contour land to improve   protection from wind and to shelter from   sun   • Degradation and failure of   foundation   • Degradation and failure of   roof and building envelope   • Exposure to higher water   levels from sea level rise   • Increased damage from   flooding, wind, fire   • Update building and construction codes   • Retrofit existing structures   • Provide redundancy in energy, water and   wastewater systems.    • Improve protective measures (e.g., natural   features, seawalls, tree sheltering, and fire   breaks)   • Change occupational conditions and land   use   • Relocate buildings that are still in harms   way   • Improve emergency planning and   response systems for residents        30 | P a g e    7.5.2 GREEN BUILDINGS   One of the final pieces in greening the landscape is greening buildings.  Green building (green construction,  sustainable building) refers not only to the structure itself, but also includes the processes used to create and to  manage the structure.  Green building requires an environmentally responsible and resource-efficient approach that  is evident throughout the building life-cycle from siting and design, through construction, operation, maintenance,  renovation and demolition.  Buildings are one of the largest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, and also place  significant demands on energy, water, and materials.     More sustainable approaches to design and operation of buildings have been around for decades (Table 7-7; Figure  7-20), and while the emphasis has been on energy conservation, little additional attention has as yet been paid to  how buildings can be adapted, or built better, to reduce their contributions to GHG emissions, to withstand damage  from severe weather, and/or to better shelter residents and users from the changing climate.     In Canada, environments may face more significant extremes of heat, cold, wind and precipitation.  Existing  structures in some areas may not be well equipped to handle those changes and to maintain comfortable, safe and  efficient indoor environments.  It is important that government assistance for retrofit be examined to ensure that  all opportunities to better prepare buildings are captured.  Changes will also be needed in building code  requirements for new structures to not only enhance energy efficiencies but also to ensure that minimal standards  meet changing needs for environmental conditions such as snow loads, drainage, and severe wind.                  GREEN BUILDING is “the practice of creating   structures and using processes that are   environmentally responsible and resource-efficient   throughout a building’s life-cycle from siting to   design, construction, operation, maintenance,   renovation and deconstruction. This practice   expands and complements the classical building   design concerns of economy, utility, durability, and   comfort. Green building is also known as a   sustainable or high-performance building.”    Attributed to the GOV/US EPA   HEAT AND COLD AND HUMAN SOCIETY   HEAT EXPOSURE INDICATORS include a range of   parameters such as minimum, mean or maximum   temperatures or composite indices of temperature,   humidity, and/or other meteorological variables   that are utilized to quantify the effects of heat on   morbidity and mortality.   HEAT WAVES are broadly defined as periods of   unusually hot weather over an extended period of   time, relative to local conditions.  Impacts to human   health can occur after only one or two days of   elevated temperatures.    URBAN HEAT ISLAND EFFECT refers to the   occurrence of substantially higher temperatures   (especially at night) within an urban area than is   experienced in surrounding less-built-up areas. In a   major city, the heat island effect can increase   temperatures by more than 5°C and may enhance   the health risks of climate-related warming.

The challenge covers seven areas: site,   water, energy, health, materials, equity and beauty.   http://living-future.org/lbc    Novoclimat  A program of the Quebec Ressources Naturelles et Faune department focused on improving energy efficiency in new home construction.

Public infrastructure systems (or ‘Lifelines’)  generally include critical infrastructure material to a well-functioning society (e.g.,  energy generation and transmission; transportation hubs and networks; potable  water collection, treatment and delivery systems; wastewater collection, treatment  and disposal systems; communication systems; health care facilities; police and fire  services; food supply and distribution networks).  However, as was experienced in the  aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, resilient and sustainable communities also rely on  other systems not necessarily made of bricks and mortar, but equally critical to the  restoration of well-being, including (Glavovic 2008):   • Household infrastructure - the capacity to be self-reliant in the face of  disaster;   • Cultural and social infrastructure - the fabric that holds the community  together;   • Economic infrastructure - access to financial resources;   • Political infrastructure – established, transparent systems for leadership and  decision-making; and   • Ecological infrastructure – that sustains vital goods and services.   To ensure that critical systems remain viable as conditions change, and that severe  weather and other calamitous events cannot disrupt services, it is important to:   • locate critical infrastructure and buildings away from hazard areas;   • adjust building codes to meet current conditions as well as conditions  anticipated over the life of the structure;   • provide for redundancies in delivery of essential goods and services;    • assess all options to reduce damage and ensure rapid return to service;    • provide measures to prevent secondary impacts from damage to  infrastructure to the built and natural environments (e.g., wastewater  contamination of waterways), and to    • ensure that the public is well-informed and aware of the rationale behind all  changes.       INFRASTRUCTURE:  The man-made (built) environment, supporting systems   and facilities, including buildings, land use (e.g., parks and green space),   transportation systems and utilities (e.g., energy, water).   CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE includes those systems and assets, whether   physical or virtual, that are vital to society, such that incapacity or destruction of   these systems and assets would have a debilitating impact on public health and   safety, important economic sectors, and/or security.  (Adapted from Kinney et al.   2015)   LIFELINES are the systems or networks which provide for the movement of   people, as well as for the goods, services and information upon which the safety,   well-being, and economic stability of a community depends.  Lifelines are not   only the means by which a community can support its day-to-day activities, they   also include the methods and mechanisms used to respond to emergencies.     (Adapted from Johnston et al. 2006).

The Canadian Infrastructure Report Card estimates  that replacement of aging infrastructure will cost over $1  trillion (CIRC 2016, Table 7-9).  Aging infrastructure can be  more vulnerable to changing environmental conditions and  to more extreme weather.  Aging infrastructure also  presents the opportunity for inclusion of climate adaptive  measures (including relocation) when designing and  constructing upgrades or replacements.  As Canada moves  towards investing significant capital in infrastructure  improvements, opportunities exist to implement changes  in design and construction to proactively prepare the  country for impending changes associated with shifting  climate norms and more extreme weather.    Investment in mitigation and adaptation will drive  innovation, reduce future costs and improve resiliency in  critical lifelines, making Canada more efficient and more  competitive in the global marketplace.  Reinvestment of  carbon tax revenues could lower other taxes, drive  ingenuity in community planning and design, improve  public transit systems, and provide alternative measures to  assist low income populations and climate affected  businesses.

Reduction of emissions entails greater use of alternative energy sources as well as a  reduction in energy demands. For Canada, the transition to a low-carbon society  requires change in governing policies, as well as in local practice.  Climate policies that  could support the transition towards low-carbon energy, should be developed around  the following principles (Sustainable Canada Dialogues 2015):   • Environmentally effective:  Policies that meet GHG reduction targets should  not cause significant impacts to the environment   • Cost effective: Policies to achieve maximum reductions in GHG emissions  should rely largely on options with the lowest cost   • Administratively effective:  Policies should reflect the governance capacity of  implementing jurisdictions and organizations   • Equitable:  Policies should not place unfair burdens on any societal group or  area (e.g., region, sector, income group, gender, indigenous peoples).     Many communities in Canada today are substantively reliant on energy generated by  centralized fossil fuel, nuclear, and/or hydro-electric plants, often requiring long- distance transmission systems either for fuel and/or transmission of generated energy.   Remote communities are investigating the potential for locally generated energy (e.g.,  solar photovoltaic and water heating systems, tidal, geothermal, wind, and biomass), at  least as a supplemental resource.     Across the country, and especially along the coasts, energy delivery systems can go  down during severe weather either as the result of physical disruptions to generating  or distribution systems, or pre-emptive actions to reduce hazards, protect equipment  and reduce downtime following storms.  In New York City during Hurricane Sandy, close  to 2 million people lost electrical power for at least some period (City of New York 2013).   Shutdowns also occurred in the natural gas system as operators closed valves to isolate  flooded pipelines.  Damage to electrical systems can include wind and tree damage to  distribution lines, flooded utility tunnels, and damage to generating plants.  In Halifax,  following Hurricane Juan, power restoration to residential properties was in some cases  delayed by weeks because of the shortage of electricians to repair the electrical service  to individual homes.  Offshore petroleum production may need to shut-down and/or  disconnect to avoid catastrophic damage as storm wind and wave conditions become  more extreme.         Policy targets for transition to a low-carbon sustainable Canada    (adapted from Sustainable Canada Dialogues 2015)   • Develop a national energy policy based on transitioning to low-carbon   energy   • Adopt either a national carbon tax or a national cap and trade program as   well as ambitious sectoral targets for low-carbon electricity production   • Eliminate direct and indirect subsidies to the fossil fuel industry   • Support interprovincial electricity transportation infrastructure   • Harmonize regulatory frameworks with the transition to a low-carbon   economy   • Include energy efficiency goals in government standards, and procurement    • Update emissions standards for vehicles and support fuel diversification   • Support green infrastructure and resilient and sustainable city planning    • Integrate land use, transportation and energy policy and planning at multiple   scales    • Support new models of transportation that include improvements to existing   and investment in new intercity rail and intermodal transportation systems   • Invest in new renewable and ambient energy for new and existing buildings   • Reduce energy demand and improve energy efficiency in buildings   • Adapt the National Building Code to promote energy efficiency   • Safeguard biodiversity and water quality    • Support fisheries, forestry and agricultural practices that limit GHG emissions,   enhance carbon sequestering and protect biodiversity and water quality   • Facilitate transition through support for ingenuity and participatory   governance   LOW CARBON ECONOMY (LCE)   An LCE is an economy that relies primarily on low carbon energy sources,   minimizing greenhouse gas emissions (especially carbon dioxide).  Shifting to   low carbon economies can substantially benefit nations, through transition   strategies that support innovative approaches to alternative energy systems   and reduce the potential for future damage from increasingly severe weather   events and climate change.  Low carbon economies can provide benefits in   ecosystem resilience, job creation, economic competitiveness, and improved   trade policies.       35 | P a g e    In the transportation industry, interruptions in the  delivery of gasoline to local fuel stations, as well  as electrical outages affecting pump operations  can lead to fuel shortages, rationing, and trickle- down impacts to other systems related to  insufficient and/or undependable access to fuel  for vehicles.  Shortages of heating fuel can  interrupt education, health and transportation  services    Urban centres are responsible for more than 40%  of global energy use, and over 75% of energy  related GHG emissions (Polesello and Johnson  2016).  Many urban communities rely on fossil fuel  generation for energy to heat and cool buildings,  for transportation within buildings and across  towns and cities, and for the delivery of lifeline  services.  In addition to reducing reliance on fossil  fuels for energy supply, planning for mitigation  and adaptation will require retrofit of existing  structures to improve energy conservation and  promote internal resiliency, informed siting of  new structures to enhance passive energy  conservation (e.g., sheltering from winds), and  rigorous enforcement of new building and  construction standards (Table 7-10).  San  Francisco recently (2016) committed (by 2020) to  sourcing 100% of its electricity from renewable  sources and has adopted landmark legislation that  requires all new buildings with 10 floors or less to  be fitted with either solar photovoltaic cells or  solar thermal panels.         TABLE 7-10:  Examples of energy system adaptation strategies (adapted from Rosenzweig et al., 2011)      ADAPTATION   OBJECTIVE   ENERGY GENERATION AND   DISTRIBUTION  ENERGY DEMANDS   REDUCE SENSITIVITY   • Plan for increased energy   demands, potential   reduction in output, and/or   loss of supply   • Upscale energy   infrastructure and/or reduce   demand for energy   • Increase reservoir capacity in hydro-electric   generating systems    • Install supplementary energy supply systems   (geo-thermal, solar, wind) in buildings at   elevations above anticipated flooding levels    • Add capacity and promote redundancy in   energy transmission systems    • Site new generating stations to minimize   flood risk and other environmental damage   • Employ solar and wind power systems to   offset peak demands   • Install steam powered chillers to   reduce the demand for electrical   power on hot days    • Establish or expand instruments to   encourage consumers to conserve   energy during peak demand   periods and/or extreme weather   conditions (hot or cold)   ALTER EXPOSURE   • Reduce exposure to hazards   and damage from climate   changes   • Upgrade transmission and distribution   networks to handle additional loads   associated with temperature extremes   • Require updating of storm hardening plans    • Retrofit plants to use less cooling water   • Protect power plants from flooding   • Update and expand disaster preparedness   plans   • Install solar power systems to supplement   peak demands   • Establish or expand instruments to   encourage energy conservation   during peak demand periods    • Update and enforce energy   efficient building codes   INCREASE RESILIENCE   • Enhance urban capacity to   recover from damage   • Automate power restoration procedures to   improve speed of restoration after   interruption   • Locate refineries and bulk storage in less   vulnerable areas   • Provide support for networking of energy   distribution systems to spread risk over larger   area   • Educate public on less energy   dependent life styles   • Encourage passive building design   principles and practice   • Reduce or eliminate energy   subsidies to reflect true costs        36 | P a g e    When planning for energy conservation, it is important to consider all types of energy used in the construction and  operation of buildings and spaces.  Considerable savings in energy are possible when buildings are sited and designed  to increase sheltering, enhance the potential for passive heating and cooling, and conserve energy in the materials  selected for construction.  Energy savings in the landscape can capitalize on transitioning from traditional (cheap)  forms of outdoor lighting to newer approaches that focus illumination where it is needed, eliminating light pollution  in the landscape, promoting dark sky initiatives and reducing operational costs (Figure 7-21).                   ENERGY TYPES USED IN CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATION OF BUILDINGS AND LANDSCAPES   (adapted from Thompson and Sorvig 2008)   OPERATING ENERGY (end use energy) is the energy used in day to day functioning of structures and landscapes   (e.g., for heating, cooling, outdoor lighting, elevators)   FUEL ENERGY (inherent or specific energy) is the energy given off by a material when it is burned, and is applied   only to those materials that have practical value as fuel.  Fuel energy uses can include the production of electricity   from gas-powered generators and powering construction and maintenance equipment.   EMBODIED ENERGY (life cycle energy) refers to the energy used to manufacture materials (e.g., to extract raw   materials, to refine and/or combine them, to shape and assemble parts).  Embodied energy also includes the energy   used to transport the item from manufacturing site to location for use and the energy needed to dismantle and   dispose of the material at the end of its useful life.   FIGURE 7-21:  Different options for lighting the landscape include (Adapted from Thompson and Sorvig 2008):     A - Traditional non-cutoff lighting fixtures, cheap, wasteful and light polluting   B – Cutoff lighting that lights dead air, and still produces bounced up-lighting   C – Louvered lighting that puts light where it is most effective and least polluting,       37 | P a g e    7.6.2 TRANSPORTATION   Transportation of goods and services, whether by rail, road, ship or aircraft plays a significant  role in GHG emissions throughout much of Canada and is vulnerable to a wide range of both  short -term and longer-term impacts associated with the changing climate and increasingly  severe weather (Table 7-11).  We are a large country, whose resources and manufactured  goods must often travel considerable distance to consumers.  Our transportation networks are  a complex interaction between sea, water, road, rail and air traffic.     Central to many fresh-water and marine coastal communities are their ports and harbours, all  of which will face impacts from the changing climate, whether or not seas are rising in that  area.  Like much of Canada’s transportation infrastructure, wharves, docks, breakwaters,  seawalls, are all aging and in need of attention.  While rising seas may increase the potential  for some harbours to receive vessels with deeper draft, in other areas, higher high-water levels  will force adaptation to mooring and loading and offloading facilities.  In areas of the coast,  such as the Chignecto Isthmus between New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, important rail and  road systems are at risk should a combination of rising seas, high tides and storm surge all occur  at the same time.  In these and other areas of Atlantic Canada and parts of British Columbia,  historic and modern dykes which have protected settlements for as much as hundreds of years,  are now in danger of being over-topped during storm events.  Given the state of aging  infrastructure in the country, there is an opportunity to combine badly needed repairs and  replacements with planning and design for anticipated changes to environmental conditions.     Not all transportation systems will survive the coming changes.  In areas where road and rail  service has followed coastlines, the threats posed by erosion and inundation may require  relocation of some parts of the system to less hazardous lands.  Along the coasts in Nova Scotia,  road links to small villages are already regularly flooded during storm events, isolating what  can be aging and vulnerable residents.  In some situations, resolution of the problem may be  financially impractical.     Transportation linkages will be threatened by more than rising seas.  Wildfires, such as those  experienced in Fort McMurray Alberta in 2016, demonstrate how vulnerable even modern  communities can be when road and rail links and evacuation routes are blocked.  Planning for  redundancy in transportation may become necessary not only for transportation of goods and  services, but also to ensure human safety.       TABLE 7-11:  Basic mitigation and adaptation options for transportation infrastructure   POTENTIAL IMPACTS FROM   CLIMATE CHANGE AND   DISASTER EVENTS   MITIGATION AND   ADAPTATION OPTIONS   • Damage to port facilities from sea-  level rise and extreme weather    • Degradation and failure of road   and rail beds   • Storm damage to bridges and   overpasses   • Flooded tunnels   • Extreme weather Interruptions to   road and rail traffic resulting from   flooding across major corridors    • Interruptions to air travel    • Increased damage from flooding,   wind, fire   • Higher temperature, additional   freeze/thaw cycles, increased solar   radiation could reduce the life of   asphalt surfaces on roads, airports   and parking areas.   • Increased stresses on concrete and   steel as a result of   expansion/contraction and   movement from high winds and   freeze/cold cycles   • Impacts of sea-level rise (e.g.,   increased tidal and salt gradients,   changes in ground water pressures,   increased corrosion of materials)   • Deterioration in stability of ice   roads   • Deterioration of road networks in   permafrost areas   • Update construction   codes   • Retrofit existing   transportation structures   • Provide redundancy in   transportation systems.    • Improve protective   measures (e.g., natural   features, windbreaks,   seawalls)   • Adjust pier heights and   docking facilities to   account for higher high   water   • Proactively plan for   relocation of services and   infrastructure in harms   way   • Increase frequency of   periodic inspection of   transportation   infrastructure   • Provide warning systems   for potentially flooded   infrastructure (e.g., road   tunnels)   • Alter emergency planning   routes and relocate   resources        38 | P a g e    URBAN TRANSPORATION AND THE FAMILY CAR   The search for ways to reduce GHG emissions from transportation can not be limited to commercial  and industrial users but must also examine the use of personal vehicles for transportation to and  from work, education and access to goods and services.  One of the most significant gains that can  be made in mitigation would be in the reduction of emissions from those vehicles, and in reduced  use of personal vehicles on a daily basis.  Many governments in Canada have realized that it is no  longer practical for most residents to commute long distances from work to home to services,  especially when using their own vehicles.  However, the geometry of much of the urban  development that has taken place in the last fifty years remains dependent on the personal vehicle  as the preferred method for transport.     Throughout Canada, there have predominantly been two kinds of street systems in small and large  urban areas; interconnected and dendritic.  Interconnected systems developed largely before 1950,  were rich in connectivity (i.e., easy access by foot from homes to work and services) and  demonstrated a relatively high number of street intersections per square kilometre (Russel 2011;  Condon 2010).  Interconnected systems were typical of the early streetcar cities described by  Condon and are generally also characterised by easily accessible linkages to ports, railroads, and  airports.  Dendritic street systems, which have dominated urban landscapes since the 1950s, are  tree-like, hierarchical, meandering, and often culminate in cul-de-sacs.  Streets branch away from  major collectors, move traffic onto ever smaller streets, and separate the homes located on the cul- de-sacs from the noise and irritation of collector traffic.  In dendritic systems, there is less road  surface per lot, but it generally takes longer (by foot, bicycle or car) to travel to residential areas, or  to access work, goods and services.     Newer approaches to planning for resilience and sustainability are based on expectations that the  new building block for communities, including redevelopment of urban core areas, will reflect a  different approach to transit, where planning and design for car movement and parking does not  dominate the landscape, streets are attractive and walkable, and there is a mixture of land use and  population densities, all located within short walking distance of a public transit node.  Condon’s  Seven Rules (See also Section 7.3.2.2) are especially valid when considering opportunities for  adaptation of modes of public and private transportation in Canada.  While much can be done to  improve existing modes of active (e.g., cycling, walking) and public transit to make the options more  attractive, the best return on investment will be achieved when urban form and structure transition  to more interconnected and less vehicle-oriented settlement patterns.   When planning for adaptation to climate change, strategies for development and management of  transportation opportunities should focus on reducing linear forms of development, improving  walking and cycling options, and improving options for public transit.  Public transportation systems  can be less vulnerable to disruption from extreme weather as they often “experience lower levels of  damage, are quicker to restore functioning and service, and have fewer negative environmental  impacts” (Beatley 2009).     URBAN TRANSPORTATION POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS   • Require urban design features and the layout of major land   uses (e.g. institutions, green space, commercial areas) that   support higher order transit and active transportation.    • Promote access to rapid transit.   • Link transit to existing office/industrial/commercial hubs.   • Promote urban design that supports higher order transit and   public and active transportation   • Add passenger hierarchy planning to transportation planning   initiatives   • Promote addition of bicycle parking requirements to   requirements for new development     39 | P a g e    7.6.3 WATER AND WASTEWATER   Planning policy and decisions on the location and design of public water and  wastewater services have been described as ‘growth shapers’ because of the  influence they provide in either encouraging or discouraging development (Beatley  2009).  Since the 1950s, as people continued to relocate from rural to urban areas, the  amount of land and resources consumed by expanding North American communities  has far exceeded the rate of population growth.  The availability of relatively cheap  land on the boundaries of many communities, and the availability of the family car as  the preferred means for transportation, led almost to an abandonment of the inner  city as the preferred place for residential properties.  Development costs were often  cheaper in the outskirts, where provision of services such as drinking water,  wastewater and solid waste collection and disposal and the future availability of  schools, public transit, and health services were not the responsibility of the sub- division developer.  The opportunity to own larger, modern homes on bigger lots  encouraged many people to invest significant proportions of their income,  anticipating that the house would eventually provide a large proportion of their  retirement resources.  Municipalities eventually realized that the growth in sprawling,  low-density residential areas, would require significant investments in expensive  capital infrastructure, especially when it became clear that residential properties in  these areas consumed a disproportionate amount of resources per capita (e.g.,  drinking water).  Russel (2011) estimated that the costs to service a home in a new  subdivision with water and sewer were in the order of $50 to $60K US, as opposed to  costs of only $5 to $10K US in more established areas.    Maintenance and upgrade of existing water and wastewater services, as well as siting  decisions for new facilities, distribution systems and wastewater outfalls, must take  into account how local conditions will change in the near and more distant future.  The  lifecycles for much of Canada’s water and wastewater infrastructure are such that  planning and construction for environmental change would be a prudent and cost- effective decision for most municipalities.  Climate change issues such as continued  supply of uncontaminated water, increased loading on stormwater systems and the  impacts of rising seas and severe weather on nearshore facilities, and the effective  operation of outfalls are not minor distractions for current planning and design.  These  issues require considerable attention if the systems being constructed or updated will  continue to function under future conditions.         CASCADING EFFECTS ON POTABLE WATER SYSTEMS   • Warmer temperatures may drive greater water demand, lead to greater   evaporation and to lower groundwater tables   • Switching between surface and groundwater sources for public water supplies   may affect the integrity of water bodies   • Summer water supplies that depend on winter snow pack may disappear   • Changes in treatment processes may be required   • Increased growth of algae and microbes may affect drinking water quality   • Lower freshwater flows may not keep saltwater downstream of intakes   • Coastal aquifers may be salinized from insufficient freshwater input, from   higher demands on groundwater and/or from saltwater intrusion resulting   from rising sea levels and coastal flooding   • Maintaining passing flows at diversions may be difficult   • Water infrastructure may be vulnerable to flooding and/or erosion, which can   also increase downstream turbidity and affect water quality   • Rising sea levels or storm surges may push salt fronts upstream past water   diversions      CASCADING EFFECTS ON WASTEWATER SYSTEMS   • Lower snow cover may reduce spring or summer flows, and raise pollutant   concentration in receiving waters   • Warmer surface waters may mean that temperature criteria for discharges are   exceeded (thermal pollution), and/or increase pollutant toxicity    • Low-flow requirements for discharging may not be met   • Pollutant concentrations may increase if sources stay the same and flow   diminishes   • Combined sewer overflows may increase in frequency and volume   • Treatment plants may go offline during intense floods   • Rising water levels may affect treatment plant gravity-based discharges    • Treatment infrastructure may be susceptible to inundation with subsequent   contamination of flood and surface waters, soils, and buildings   • Sewage may mix with seawater in combined sewer systems   (Adapted from GOV/USA/EPA 2014)     40 | P a g e    Throughout the country, many wastewater treatment systems are gravity-based, and  facilities are in proximity to the shore, where they are vulnerable to wave action and  inundation.  In coastal areas, wastewater outfalls, designed to operate within  hydraulic parameters built upon mean water depths, will need retrofit to ensure they  are able to withstand bottom scouring from larger waves, and that dispersal rates for  effluent remain achievable.  As sea levels continue to rise, the hydraulic head driving  the outfall will decrease, leading to potential sewage backup and flooding or to the  need for additional pumping capacity to assist discharge of the effluent.     In more inland locations, changes in mean water levels in lakes and rivers, whether  periodic or sustained, may also affect the deposition and dilution of wastewaters.   Overland flooding may threaten not only plant infrastructure, but the operating  parameters of the systems themselves.    Cities which have allowed stormwater piping systems to be combined with sewerage  systems, should move to rectify this situation before increasing stormwater flows  impede the continued functioning of treatment facilities and/or before contaminant  levels in overflows to the natural environment reach unacceptable levels. In high rise  buildings and other structures, power outages can cause interruptions to pumping  systems needed for the distribution of potable water and for the movement and  treatment of wastewater.  Power outages can also render inoperable pumping  stations needed to move sewage and stormwater past unsupportive topography,  resulting in stagnation, sewer backups and potential flooding and contamination of  streets and of the lower stories of buildings and homes.            MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION OPTIONS FOR WATER AND WASTEWATER   SYSTEMS   • Value water for its contributions to ecosystems and to society   • Assess the potential for future drought, and increased flows resulting from   cloudbursts and overland flooding, and plan accordingly   • Adopt innovative land use instruments to protect critical water resource areas   • Avoid urban sprawl   • Update municipal plans, as well as subdivision regulations   • Encourage municipalities to recover the full cost of sewerage works and   operations   • Separate stormwater and sanitary sewage collection and treatment systems   • Conduct regular inspection and maintenance on dams, wells, reservoirs, and   collection and piping systems.    • Protect existing drinking water sources, identify alternatives   • Minimize the use of road salt, and manage snow dumping to protect water   resources   • Assess potential for intrusion of saltwater (and other contaminants) in drinking   water sources   • Assess potential for new pathogens in drinking water and in discharged   wastewater   • Encourage water conservation   • Work across jurisdictions to coordinate water extraction permits   • Assess effect of higher/colder temperatures on wastewater treatment systems   • Assess wastewater treatment technologies to minimize GHG emissions   • Build resiliency into water and wastewater distribution/treatment systems   • Ensure that contaminant levels in effluents do not adversely affect the quality   of surface and marine waters, seafood or other flora and fauna   • Move effluent outfalls to more appropriate locations      41 | P a g e    7.7 STEWARDING CULTURE AND HERITAGE    Cultural landscapes and heritage sites are interrelated elements which share  important similarities with regards to climate change impacts and adaptation  strategies.  While the term heritage sites (or historic sites) has been used for many  years and appears well understood, the term cultural landscape is relatively new to  many people.     As determined by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization  in their World Heritage Convention and related guidelines (UNESCO 1972, 2008),  cultural landscapes are defined relative to the human societies that they have shaped  or, in turn, been shaped by.  The value of a site as a cultural landscape is dependent  on the intermingling of human and natural environment rather than on unique  attributes or contributions to geological or natural heritage.     Conversely heritage sites can be designated based entirely on either their contribution  to human cultural heritage, or to their contribution as a natural feature of outstanding  ecological or physical value.  In some cases, sites will have both cultural and natural  heritage features of importance and are then considered to be of ‘mixed cultural and  natural heritage’.     Simply put, sites of cultural heritage usually exist within a wider cultural landscape  and can be the major focal component when defining the value of the landscape.   Natural heritage sites can exist outside of cultural landscapes, especially when the  heritage value is unrelated to the development of human society.                                    CULTURAL LANDSCAPES are properties that represent the combined works of   nature and of man.  They are illustrative of the evolution of human society and   settlement over time, under the influence of the physical constraints and/or   opportunities presented by their natural environment and of successive social,   economic and cultural forces, both external and internal.  (UNESCO 1972)   HERITAGE SITES are separated into two broad categories by UNESCO (1972):    “CULTURAL HERITAGE includes:   • monuments: architectural works, works of monumental sculpture and   painting, elements or structures of an archaeological nature, inscriptions, cave   dwellings and combinations of features, which are of outstanding universal   value from the point of view of history, art or science;    • groups of buildings: groups of separate or connected buildings which,   because of their architecture, their homogeneity or their place in the   landscape, are of outstanding universal value from the point of view of history,   art or science;    • sites: works of man or the combined works of nature and of man, and areas   including archaeological sites which are of outstanding universal value from   the historical, aesthetic, ethnological or anthropological points of view.”   NATURAL HERITAGE includes:   • natural features consisting of physical and biological formations or groups of   such formations, which are of outstanding universal value from the aesthetic   or scientific point of view; geological and physiographical formations and   precisely delineated areas which constitute the habitat of threatened species   of animals and plants of outstanding universal value from the point of view of   science or conservation;    • natural sites or precisely delineated natural areas of outstanding universal   value from the point of view of science, conservation or natural beauty.”   Members of the First Nations of Canada… “recognized the need to   develop anticipatory reactions to rapid climate change and to   evolve activities in continuity with the land, while still staying the   same as a people and retaining their cultural identity.”    (Golden et al. 2015, p410   (Image Credits: C Mercer Clarke)     42 | P a g e    7.7.1 VALUING PLACE   Cultural landscapes and heritage sites share specific values that are important to climate change adaptation planning.   These are the values that celebrate our heritage and provide a foundation for the future of societies.  These deeply  held convictions define our communities, and provide inspiration for creative planning and design and include:   SENSE OF PLACE   Cultural landscapes are the expression of human interactions with a specific location in the environment, tied there  by ecological or physical attributes, by the history of the space, or by cultural events that have taken place, do take  place, and/or will continue to take place in that location.  This sense of place has a permanence, a stability and a  timelessness about it that resonates throughout society.  Cultural landscapes represent a unique challenge to planning  for adaptation, because they do not lend themselves to being altered (protected) adapted (accommodated) or moved  (migrated), without significantly changing the features that make them outstanding or unique.  Natural heritage sites  tend to exist because of an ecological or physical feature in the landscape that is specific to its location.  With heritage  sites, their attachment to place could easily be lost by movement of structures or cultural elements, losing the link  between humans and environment.  In cases along the coasts, where threats are unavoidable, and damage is  unacceptable, there may be no other plausible option than to move as much of the site as possible, but this should be  considered only in extreme conditions and as a last resort.  For many cultural landscapes, it is neither physically nor  economically practical to consider migration of the assets, so communities must prepare themselves for the loss.    LIFESPAN   Unlike most other physical expressions of human development, for the most part, we do not project lifespans for  cultural landscapes and heritage sites and appear to expect that (with maintenance) they will continue into an  undefined future.  Heritage sites have often exceeded their originally intended structural lifespan by the time they  have accrued cultural value, which can result in buildings and structures that have acquired a degree of fragility and a  sensitivity to changes in their physical environment.  For some heritage assets, the response to climate change can  often be a relatively simple solution, based on the expected lifespan of the existing infrastructure, and the cost of  relocation or rebuilding in the new location.  Given that cultural landscapes and/or heritage sites generally do not have  a projected expiration date for structures and features around which you can plan for changes, and the constraint  posed because their value to society is linked to their location, decisions to significantly alter the local environment as  a protective measure, or to remove the assets to another, safer site could render the cultural values moot.  Given that  there can be serious limitations for practical adaptation and few acceptable exit options, decisions on the future of  cultural landscapes and heritage sites must be made with considerable care and insight.   CULTURAL IDENTITY   In communities where the cultural landscape or heritage site is the basis for cultural identity (e.g., the Peggy’s Cove  lighthouse, NS), planning for adaptation must find creative and non-intrusive ways to protect and sustain those unique  attributes.  By protecting these cultural touchstones, the core features of the community remain stable, ensuring that  other adaptive changes are made more palatable.  Consideration of cultural value and cultural identity (in terms of  the long-term benefits that will accrue to the community in the future) should be an integral component of any  framework developed to guide adaptation planning.  The values inherent in cultural landscapes and heritage sites will  continue for decades, or even centuries, if they are adequately protected.

Mercer Clarke)     43 | P a g e    7.7.2 CHALLENGES TO PERSISTING   Canada’s cultural landscapes and heritage sites are scattered across a wide array  of natural environments and human settlements, and as such represent a  collection of challenges for mitigation and adaptation, many of which are unique  to each setting.  While not often unsurmountable, these challenges require  careful consideration not only of what is possible, but of what will best ensure  continuation of the special relationship between humans and the environment,  even if that means that a special and valued place will be lost.     Table 7-12 provides an outline of some of the specific challenges facing cultural  landscapes and heritage sites and the context for responses to those challenges.   Each of the challenges posed by the changing climate represents a clear, present  or future threat to the continued viability of these important assets, requiring  early attention to the documentation of existing and anticipated risks, and  immediate initiation of planning processes to consider options for action.     (Image Credits: C Mercer Clarke)   TABLE 7-12:  Challenges of climate change on cultural landscapes and heritage sites      CHALLENGE ADAPTATION ISSUES AND OPPORTUNITIES   SNOW   ACCUMULATION   Due to the age of many heritage sites, increased snow accumulation may   exceed the structural capacity of these assets, which may have already   been weakened by age.  Heritage districts within communities do not   readily support modern snow removal methods, compounding the issues.    In Charlottetown PE, narrow streets and density of structures in the   heritage downtown have posed increasing problems related to snow   accumulation and removal in recent years   FROST CYCLE   DEGRADATION    Increased freeze-thaw cycles can accelerate weathering and deterioration   on existing mortar and other materials, already made fragile by age, and   designed for climate conditions experienced over a century ago, resulting   in higher maintenance and repair costs.   THAWING   PERMAFROST   Sites in the far North are at special risk due to the thawing of the   permafrost which has previously contributed to the preservation of site   assets.  Destabilization of foundations, and erosion of coasts are but two   of the issues stemming from permafrost changes.    SEA-LEVEL RISE    Rising sea levels put coastal heritage and cultural landscapes at direct   threat of inundation and wave damage. Protection and/or migration   options are significantly more problematic for these sites, limiting   acceptable alternatives to persist in place or to relocate.     INCREASED   EROSION   Increased storm activity and rising seas combine to increase the rates of   erosion and deposition along fragile shorelines.  In areas of the coast such   as Prince Edward Island, where shorelines can be highly erodible,   changing conditions, including more frequent severe storms, has   increased the rate of shoreline retreat   EXTREMES OF   HEAT AND COLD   Higher temperatures and colder temperatures contribute to increased   deterioration in historic structures but can also lead to unexpected   impacts, such as the local extinction of critical plant or animal species that   are critical components of natural heritage   WIND   Increased wind speeds lead to increased deterioration of structures, and   also impact natural heritage sites, causing blow-down in coastal forests,   and damage or loss of beaches, dunes and habitat due to flooding and   erosion associated with wind driven storm surges.    STORM WAVES   As water levels increase due to sea-level rise and storm surge, larger   waves can reach exposed shorelines, increasing erosion and altering   coastal geomorphology.  Warmer winters reduce sea ice cover, also   increasing shoreline access for larger waves.        44 | P a g e    7.7.3 NOT ALL OPTIONS CAN WORK EVERYWHERE   Cultural landscapes and heritage sites are critical resources to local communities and to  Canadian society.  Their valuation and consideration must be included as a component in  planning for adaptation, by any community that is shaped by and benefits from their  presence, and by the larger society that values their existence.  Extreme care must be  taken that only qualified, interdisciplinary teams participate in decision-making, and that  public interests and concerns are valued through all steps of the planning and design  process.  One of the most important guiding principles should be planning for the  possibility of reversal, such that decisions taken now to ensure the longevity of structures,  can be reversed should those actions later prove to have been ill-advised.     But not all places can be saved for the future.  Available options to defray the impacts of  climate change may not work in all situations.  Cultural landscapes and heritage sites  represent an irreplaceable resource that should be protected and sustained - wherever  feasible.  Failing to act now to assess risks and examine alternatives will surely lead to a  reduction in practical options for adaptation, to potentially irreversible deterioration of  the asset, and will advance the potential for future loss.  Conversely, hasty, poorly  considered actions taken without inclusion of the latest in science and technology, and  without due consideration of all direct and indirect consequences, may not only fail to  adequately protect the assets, but may lead to further deterioration, preventable damage  and even loss of the attributes of important cultural significance.  Options for adaptation  of cultural landscapes and heritage sites must also be considered in concert with broader  community (i.e., local, regional, national) adaptation plans.  But there is no useful  argument that all cultural landscapes and heritage sites must be protected at all costs and  in all circumstances.  The reality is that some will not survive the coming changes.     By way of example, in Nova Scotia, the Fortress of Louisbourg is an important National  Historic Site; an 18th-Century fort that has been restored, and recreated, a major tourist  mecca in the region.  However, because Fortress Louisbourg is a coastal fortress, it is sited  just back from the shore of the Atlantic coast of Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia, a very  active section of coastline, relatively exposed to the sea.  Fortress Louisbourg is facing not  only rising sea levels, but also sinking land.  In this part of Nova Scotia, the land is subsiding  due to vertical land movement and the combination of rising seas and sinking lands are  significantly altering the coastline.  Since construction of the Fortress seawall along the  harbour in 1743, high tide water levels have already risen a metre (Figure 7-22).  Faced  with additional changes in water levels in the next 100 years, and beyond, the future  viability of the recreated Fortress of Louisbourg appears bleak.  Situated as it is, over such  an expanse of land, it is unlikely that adequate, cost effective protection can be provided.         “Given the scale of the problem and the cultural value of the   places at risk, it is not enough merely to plan for change and   expect to adapt.  We must begin now to prepare our threatened   landmarks to face worsening climate impacts; climate resilience   must become a national priority and we must allocate the   necessary resources.”     (Holtz et al. 2014, p 13)   FIGURE 7-22:  Historic changes in tide levels at Fortress Louisbourg. Cape Breton NS   (Image Credit: Lemmen et al, 2008)     45 | P a g e    7.8 PREPARING THE HOME GROUND   Mitigation and adaptation do not only fall to governments, organizations and commercial enterprise.  Much can be  done and should be done on the home front, by residents and volunteers working to improve neighbourhood parks  and waterways and to put available lands to better use.  For years, many of the practices in home design,  construction and maintenance have worked in opposition to the principles that build resiliency and support  sustainability.  Across Canada, municipalities are working to redress subdivision and housing requirements that can  exacerbate the impacts of the changing environment.  New designs for housing advocate for smaller, more resilient  homes, better suited to local climate, situated to optimize local topography and working to capitalize on passive  heating and sheltering.  Some of the changes possible on the home front can be simple and easy to accomplish.   Others might require capital investment, but many demonstrate a positive return on that investment over a  relatively short period of time.  Simple changes include (Beatley 2009 and others):   • Improve the resilience of homes to wind, rain, snow and ice through flood proofing lower levels, installing  sump pumps, adjusting site grades and replacing aging roofs, windows and doors.    • Incorporate high levels of insulation, high-performance windows (e.g., multiple low-emissivity coatings and  low-conductivity gas fill), and airtight construction to promote passive survivability.    • Minimize cooling loads and reduce solar heat gain by orienting buildings on an east-west axis with the long  facades facing south and north.     • Minimize east- and west-facing windows, specifying glazing that uses low solar-heat-gain-coefficient on the  east and west.   • Use overhangs and other building geometry features to shade windows, and plant trees to shade the  building and provide wind shelter.    • Even when the home design includes air conditioning, ensure windows are opened for natural ventilation  during cooler days.   • Replace impervious pavement surfaces with pervious materials.   • In drought prone areas, store water on-site in cisterns to provide supply during periods of crisis.     • Practice water conservation measures to reduce demand pressures and especially during periods of water  supply reduction.    • Disconnect roof gutters from stormwater systems, and drain the water instead into rain barrels for use on  gardens and lawns   • Provide opportunities for reuse and for infiltration of rainwater.   • Ensure septic systems are working well.   • Support local food resources through protection of agricultural lands, community gardens, and individual  back yard plots.     • Volunteer with local organizations to promote greenspace, restore streams and wetlands, and care for  urban forests.

COASTAL GEORGIA DESIGN GUIDELINES  http://www.prosserhallock.com/gcr_guidelines.html    The document applies primarily to design elements and improvements that influence the public  realm. Generally, focus on those influences that impact viewshed, identity, micro-climate,  sustainability and in limited cases public safety. They are a framework to meet the State of  Georgia's regional planning goals and implied procedures to implement portions of the Coastal  Georgia Regional Plan. The articulation of mass, form, materials, theme and design methodologies  are the primary constituents of the guidelines.
