                                          CHAPTER FIVE  LONDON’S  RESPONSE TO  CLImATE CHANgE    176 T H E  LO N D O N  P L A N  m A R C H  2 0 1 6  5.1 The Mayor is committed to making London a world leader in tackling climate  change and the policies in this chapter will support delivery of the Mayor’s vision  for London and the objectives set out in Chapter 1, in particular that London  should be:  •  A city that becomes a world leader in improving the environment locally  and globally, taking the lead in tackling climate change, reducing pollution,  developing a low carbon economy and consuming fewer resources and using  them more effectively.  5.2 This chapter sets out a comprehensive range of policies to underpin London’s  response to climate change, including underlying issues of resource management.  These policies cover climate change mitigation and adaptation, waste, aggregates,  contaminated land and hazardous substances. Rising to the challenge of climate  change is a theme that runs through this Plan, and is central to the economic,  social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development, as set out in  the NPPF. There are relevant policies in all chapters of this Plan – particularly those  on London’s Economy (Chapter 4), Transport (Chapter 6) and Living Places and  Spaces (Chapter 7).   5.3 Climate change – the rise in average global temperature due to increasing levels of  greenhouse gases in the earth’s atmosphere – is a fundamental challenge facing  the world. There is mounting evidence of its seriousness and its potential impacts.  It is caused by the emission of greenhouse gases (primarily carbon dioxide) that  prevent the radiation of heat into space. Unless these are reduced, temperatures will  continue to rise. Eventually, a tipping point could be reached, overcoming the earth’s  natural buffering systems, bringing catastrophic climate change.   5.4 Even if all greenhouse gas emissions stopped now, it is projected that the world  would still need to adapt to at least a century of irreversible climate change.  London is already feeling the effects. It is particularly vulnerable to flooding,  overheating and drought conditions which can lead to water supply shortfalls.  Climate change will increase the probability and severity of these effects through  rising sea levels, heavier winter rainfall, higher tidal surges, hotter summers  and less summer rainfall. The effects of climate change could seriously harm  Londoners’ quality of life, particularly the health and social and economic welfare  of vulnerable people.  5.5 The latest UK Climate Projections 2009 (UKCP09)162 have helped inform the  development of the London Plan. Like previous projections (UKCP02) these show  how the UK’s climate is likely to change over the next century but provide greater  detail regarding London’s future temperature, rainfall and seasonal changes. They  point to warmer and drier summers, and wetter winters, with appreciable changes  seen by the 2020s. UKCP09 suggests that London could:  •  by the 2020s, see an increase in summer mean temperature of 1.5 degrees  Celsius, a decrease in mean summer rainfall of six per cent and an increase in   162 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra).

Under the Greater London Authority Act  2007, the Mayor has a new statutory duty to contribute towards the mitigation of,  and adaptation to, climate change in the UK. The Mayor will use all of his powers,  resources and influence to work with other agencies to raise awareness and  promote behavioural change. He has already produced a strategy for Climate  Change Adaptation163 (the first for a major world city) and a strategy for Climate  Change Mitigation and Energy164. He has also produced other strategies related  to Waste Management, Air Quality, Water and Biodiversity, to manage London’s  resources and to protect and enhance its environment. The Mayor will ensure  that policies in this Plan are complemented by those in other mayoral strategies  (particularly the Mayor’s Transport Strategy, which sets carbon dioxide reduction  targets to be achieved in the transport system), and by supportive national,  European Union and international policies and programmes (such as the Kyoto  Protocol or any successor).    5.7 The London Plan supports the Mayor’s strategies for tackling climate change  particularly in relation to the built environment. The biggest challenge for London  is to improve the contribution of the existing building stock (80 per cent of which  will be still standing in 2050) to mitigating and adapting to climate change. While  the London Plan’s influence may be limited in this regard, its policies can strongly  influence the way in which new development in London responds to the challenge  of climate change, and creates opportunities for existing areas with respect to  both mitigation and adaptation.   5.8 For development proposals the early design stage is the most cost effective time  to incorporate relevant design and technological measures, enabling proposals to  realise their full potential to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and adapt to climate  change. Responding to climate change has to be an integral and essential part of  the development process and not a set of ‘bolt-ons’ – increasingly, this will be seen  as a key part of ensuring buildings are fit for purpose into the future. Preventative  and adaptive measures will generate long term savings (particularly for energy  and water use), and over time the inclusion of such measures should have positive  impacts on property values as occupiers become more aware of the impacts   163 Mayor of London.

Climate Change Mitigation and Energy Strategy, GLA, Summer 2011    178 T H E  LO N D O N  P L A N  m A R C H  2 0 1 6  of climate change on their environment. The costs and feasibility of measures  to tackle climate change within developments need to be balanced against the  potential cumulative costs that would come from failing to respond to the need for  mitigation and adaptation.  5.9 Tackling climate change will also require a move towards more sustainable energy  sources, and the London Plan seeks to support the development of decentralised  energy systems, including the use of low carbon and renewable energy and the  greater utilisation of energy generated from waste. This will also allow London to  generate more of its own energy needs and enhance the security of its energy  supply.  5.9a To support the Mayor’s energy ambitions and to mitigate climate change it is  essential that the additional energy infrastructure required to power a growing  London can support low and zero carbon energy supply. The long term vision  for London’s energy infrastructure is a resilient electricity network with capacity  provided where and when it is required to accommodate projected growth and  decentralised energy across the capital.   5.10 The Mayor believes that making better use of waste and careful husbandry of  London’s limited aggregate reserves have major roles to play in tackling climate  change. He believes that London’s waste is potentially a valuable resource that can  be exploited for London’s environmental, economic and social benefit.  Climate Change Mitigation  5.11 The Mayor expects all development to make the fullest contribution to the  mitigation of climate change – that is limiting the extent of future change beyond  what is already locked in. The following policies seek to reduce the emissions  of carbon dioxide, primarily by reducing emissions from new development and  supporting development of low carbon energy infrastructure to produce energy  more efficiently and exploit the opportunities to utilise energy from waste. These  policies also have the potential to enhance the security of London’s energy supply  and reduce overall energy consumption.  5.12 The Mayor’s Climate Change Mitigation and Energy Strategy contains further  proposals to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and to tackle climate change  through decarbonising London’s energy supply, reducing the energy consumption  of London’s existing building stock and moving towards zero emission transport in  London (see also Chapter 5.22 in the Mayor’s Transport Strategy).                    T H E  LO N D O N  P L A N  m A R C H  2 0 1 6  179     5.13 The UK is the world’s eighth largest emitter of carbon dioxide, and London is  responsible for 8.4 per cent of these emissions (the latest annual estimate is 44.71  million tonnes165). On a business as usual basis it is expected that annual carbon  dioxide emissions will actually fall to 40.34 million tonnes by 2025 (a 10 per cent  decrease on 1990 levels)166. London also has the lowest domestic carbon dioxide  emissions per person per year, at 2.26 tonnes, and the joint lowest transport  emission rate per person, at 1.38 tonnes, of all the UK regions167. This is largely due  to the higher use of public transport and the density of development in London.   5.14 There is growing scientific consensus that stabilising atmospheric carbon  dioxide emissions to levels at or below 450 parts per million is required to avoid  catastrophic climate change. The strategic target in Policy 5.1 represents the  emissions reduction required in London as a contribution to stabilising the world’s  emissions at this level by 2050. As part of the Climate Change Act 2008 the  Government established a target to reduce the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions  by 80 per cent by 2050 and has proposed carbon budgets as a means to work  towards this UK target.  5.15 The strategic target in Policy 5.1 will be extremely challenging but it will be  achievable with the full commitment and collaboration of all stakeholders,  particularly national government. Progress will be kept under review to ensure that  policies and programmes set out in the Climate Change Mitigation and Energy  Strategy are on track. Overall, the most substantial emissions savings London can  make will come from initiatives to decarbonise its energy supply and to reduce  the emissions from the existing building stock. In the planning context, the Mayor  expects that all new development will fully contribute towards the reduction  of carbon dioxide emissions, and this will be principally achieved through the  application of Policy 5.2 and the Mayor’s energy hierarchy.

GLA 2009  POLICy 5.1 CLImATE CHANgE mITIgATION  Strategic A The Mayor seeks to achieve an overall reduction in London’s carbon   dioxide emissions of 60 per cent (below 1990 levels) by 2025.  It is expected that the GLA Group, London boroughs and other  organisations will contribute to meeting this strategic reduction target,  and the GLA will monitor progress towards its achievement annually.   LDF preparation B Within LDFs boroughs should develop detailed policies and proposals   that promote and are consistent with the achievement of the Mayor’s  strategic carbon dioxide emissions reduction target for London.    180 T H E  LO N D O N  P L A N  m A R C H  2 0 1 6  regarding how the Mayor expects London to achieve this strategic target is  outlined in the Mayor’s Climate Change Mitigation and Energy Strategy.   POLICy 5.2 mINImISINg CARbON DIOxIDE EmISSIONS  Planning decisions A Development proposals should make the fullest contribution to   minimising carbon dioxide emissions in accordance with the following  energy hierarchy:   1 Be lean: use less energy 2 Be clean: supply energy efficiently 3 Be green: use renewable energy  B The Mayor will work with boroughs and developers to ensure that  major developments meet the following targets for carbon dioxide  emissions reduction in buildings. These targets are expressed as  minimum improvements over the Target Emission Rate (TER) outlined  in the national Building Regulations leading to zero carbon residential  buildings from 2016 and zero carbon non-domestic buildings from  2019.  Residential buildings:   Non-domestic buildings:  year Improvement on 2010 building Regulatons  2010 – 2013 25 per cent (Code for Sustainable Homes level 4)t  2013 – 2016 40 per cent  2016 – 2031 Zero Carbon  year Improvement on 2010 building Regulatons  2010 – 2013 25 per cent  2013 – 2016 40 per cent  2016 – 2019 As per building regulations requirements  2019 - 2031 Zero Carbon    T H E  LO N D O N  P L A N  m A R C H  2 0 1 6  181  5.16 Carbon dioxide emissions from new development should be reduced by  sustainable use of energy in accordance with the Mayor’s energy hierarchy. The  first step in the hierarchy, to reduce energy demand, should be met through  adopting sustainable design principles outlined in Policy 5.3. The second step, to  supply energy efficiently, should be met by prioritising decentralised energy, as  outlined in Policies 5.5 and 5.6. The third step, to use renewable energy, is outlined  in Policy 5.7.   5.17 Over time both the Mayor and the Government expect all new development  will be zero carbon. The Government has expressed the aim that all new homes  should be zero carbon by 2016 and new non-domestic buildings should be zero  carbon by 2019. This will result in a significant step change in the national Building  Regulations (Part L) in terms of the minimum improvements over the Target  Emission Rate (TER)168 for new development.   5.18 The targets set out in Policy 5.2 are minimum improvements over the TER for  London as advances are made towards zero carbon development. This approach  conforms to the Government’s Code for Sustainable Homes (CSH), which outlines   168 TER is the calculated target carbon dioxide emission rate for a development, expressed in kilograms of  carbon dioxide per annum  C Major development proposals should include a detailed energy  assessment to demonstrate how the targets for carbon dioxide  emissions reduction outlined above are to be met within the framework  of the energy hierarchy.   D As a minimum, energy assessments should include the following details:  a calculation of the energy demand and carbon dioxide emissions  covered by Building Regulations and, separately, the energy  demand and carbon dioxide emissions from any other part of the  development, including plant or equipment, that are not covered by  the Building Regulations (see paragraph 5.22) at each stage of the  energy hierarchy  b proposals to reduce carbon dioxide emissions through the energy  efficient design of the site, buildings and services  c proposals to further reduce carbon dioxide emissions through the  use of decentralised energy where feasible, such as district heating  and cooling and combined heat and power (CHP)  d proposals to further reduce carbon dioxide emissions through the  use of on-site renewable energy technologies.  E The carbon dioxide reduction targets should be met on-site. Where it is  clearly demonstrated that the specific targets cannot be fully achieved  on-site, any shortfall may be provided off-site or through a cash in  lieu contribution to the relevant borough to be ring fenced to secure  delivery of carbon dioxide savings elsewhere.     182 T H E  LO N D O N  P L A N  m A R C H  2 0 1 6  targeted improvements, as individual code levels for residential buildings, towards  the achievement of zero carbon housing.   5.19 The targets for 2010 to 2013 in Policy 5.2 are equivalent to the energy  requirements for code level 4 of the CSH for residential buildings. These targets  are informed by the observed performance of new development since the London  Plan was first published in 2004, and have been established as achievable and  suitable for London. The GLA’s most recent monitoring information169 shows that  on average development proposals approved by the Mayor since September  2007 have achieved typical savings between of 30 and 40 per cent above  Building Regulation requirements, with about a quarter of applications meeting or  exceeding 40 per cent savings.  5.20 The targets outlined apply to all major development proposals. The highest level  of carbon dioxide emissions reduction will be sought in every proposal, and the  Mayor will actively encourage zero carbon development where appropriate. Overall  carbon dioxide emissions reductions should reflect the context of each proposal,  taking account of its size, nature, location, accessibility and expected operation.  The targets will be used by the Mayor in the consideration of proposals that come  before him for determination and to guide the development of proposals within  opportunity and intensification areas as well as for monitoring purposes. They  may also influence proposals falling within the ambit of the wider GLA Group. At  borough level, the steeper trajectory towards meeting the Government’s target  of zero carbon residential development by 2016 and non-domestic buildings by  2019 should be sought from major developments taking account of such factors  as ease and practicability of connection to existing networks, context, size, nature,  location, accessibility and expected operation.  5.21 Every major development proposal should be accompanied by an energy  assessment demonstrating how the targets for carbon dioxide emissions  reduction will be met within the framework of the energy hierarchy. Boroughs are  also encouraged to require energy assessments for other development proposals  where appropriate. Full details regarding how to prepare an energy assessment  are outlined in Appendix D of the supplementary planning guidance on Sustainable  Design and Construction.  5.22 Some developments (such as offices, industrial units and hospitals) have  significant carbon dioxide emissions related to energy consumption from  electrical equipment and portable appliances that are not accounted for in  Building Regulations, and therefore are not included within the calculations for the  Target Emissions Rate. The strategic aim is to reduce carbon emissions overall,  so that while planning decisions and monitoring requirements will be underpinned  by the targets expressed in Policy 5.2B, the requirement in Policy 5.2Da for energy  assessments to include separate details of unregulated emissions is to recognise  explicitly the additional contribution that can be made through use of efficient   169 London South Bank University.

Demand side management enables non-essential  equipment to be turned off or to operate at a lower capacity to respond to the  wider availability of energy in the network – that is, the wider energy demand  and generation across the network. Developments are encouraged to include  infrastructure to enable demand side management.  5.23 Where it is demonstrated that the specific targets for carbon dioxide emissions  reduction cannot be fully achieved on-site the shortfall may be provided off-site,  but only in cases where there is an alternative proposal identified and delivery is  certain, or where funding can be pooled to support specific carbon dioxide  reduction projects or programmes. Further guidance on the criteria for off-site  provision, the types of acceptable projects and programmes and a London wide  funding scheme will be set out for boroughs.  POLICy 5.3 SuSTAINAbLE DESIgN AND CONSTRuCTION  Strategic A The highest standards of sustainable design and construction should   be achieved in London to improve the environmental performance of  new developments and to adapt to the effects of climate change over  their lifetime.   Planning decisions B Development proposals should demonstrate that sustainable design   standards are integral to the proposal, including its construction and  operation, and ensure that they are considered at the beginning of the  design process.   C Major development proposals should meet the minimum standards  outlined in the Mayor’s supplementary planning guidance and this  should be clearly demonstrated within a design and access statement.  The standards include measures to achieve other policies in this Plan  and the following sustainable design principles:  a minimising carbon dioxide emissions across the site, including the  building and services (such as heating and cooling systems)  b avoiding internal overheating and contributing to the urban heat  island effect  c efficient use of natural resources (including water), including  making the most of natural systems both within and around  buildings    184 T H E  LO N D O N  P L A N  m A R C H  2 0 1 6  5.24 The principles underlying sustainable design and construction reflect a number  of policies in this Plan. In particular they seek to improve the environmental  performance of buildings, including consideration of climate change mitigation  and adaptation. Policy 5.3 is intended to ensure that buildings minimise carbon  dioxide emissions; are efficient in resource use; protect the environment;  recognise the uniqueness of locations; are healthy and adaptable; and make the  most of natural systems including, for example, the use of passive solar design  or local ecosystems. It should be considered alongside policies dealing with  architecture and design in Chapter 7.  5.25 Design features such as green roofs (see Policy 5.11) can enhance biodiversity,  absorb rainfall, improve the performance of the building, reduce the urban heat  island effect and improve the appearance of a development. Use of appropriate  materials is also key, and where practicable those with a high embodied  energy (see glossary) should be avoided. The Mayor’s supplementary planning  guidance on Sustainable Design and Construction and on Housing reflect key  sustainable design principles and outline the standards that are applicable to all  developments. These standards should be considered early in the design process  and should be addressed in the design and access statement to show how they  have been integrated into the development proposal.   5.27 In support of the London Housing Strategy the Mayor has produced a Housing  Design Guide170 (see Chapter 3), which provides further guidance on the standards  outlined in the Mayor’s Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance.  5.28 Sustainable construction is also a key consideration.

This addresses the environmental impact of construction171,  including minimising emissions of dust and construction plant and vehicles  emissions. The Mayor also encourages the use of the Demolition Protocol172  developed by London Remade to support recycling and reuse of construction  materials.  5.29 Retrofitting buildings can make a significant contribution to the climate change  and resource management aims of this Plan – for example, London’s existing  domestic buildings contribute 36 per cent of the region’s carbon dioxide  emissions alone. Along with other non-domestic buildings, retrofitting the existing  building stock presents a significant opportunity to help meet the strategic carbon  dioxide reduction target of 60 per cent by 2025.  5.30 Policy 5.4 applies the principles in Policy 5.3 to existing building stock where  retrofit opportunities arise (for example, large estate refurbishments). The Mayor  supports an integrated, multi-agency approach, to promote the retrofitting of  existing buildings, and where possible policies and programmes supporting  zero carbon development and deployment of decentralised energy should also   171 Mayor of London and London Councils.

In particular, programmes should reduce carbon dioxide emissions,  improve the efficiency of resource use (such as water) and minimise the  generation of pollution and waste from existing building stock.  LDF preparation B Within LDFs boroughs should develop policies and proposals regarding   the sustainable retrofitting of existing buildings. In particular they  should identify opportunities for reducing carbon dioxide emissions  from the existing building stock by identifying potential synergies  between new developments and existing buildings through the  retrofitting of energy efficiency measures, decentralised energy and  renewable energy opportunities (see Policies 5.5 and 5.7).     186 T H E  LO N D O N  P L A N  m A R C H  2 0 1 6  be applied to existing buildings. The Mayor will support measures through the  Building Regulations and other regulatory and funding mechanisms to improve the  performance of London’s existing buildings, increase energy and water efficiency,  and to make full use of technologies such as decentralised energy and renewable  energy.  5.31 Further details regarding programmes for retrofitting can be found in the Mayor’s  Climate Change Mitigation and Energy Strategy and in the London Climate Change  Adaptation Strategy. The London Housing Strategy also outlines actions to retrofit  existing homes with an emphasis on increasing energy efficiency and reducing  carbon dioxide emissions. In addition, useful guidance for retrofitting existing  homes is provided in the report Your home in a changing climate published by the  Three Regions Climate Change Group173, and on English Heritage’s climate change  website174.   173 Three Regions Climate Change Group.

The  forecasting of requirements should take into account the opportunities  and impacts of decentralised energy and demand management  measures.   Planning Decisions B Developers, especially of major schemes, should engage at an early   stage with relevant boroughs and energy companies to identify the gas  and electricity requirements arising from their development proposals.  C The Mayor will work with relevant boroughs, energy companies and  other relevant parties to support where appropriate development  proposals for gas and electricity infrastructure which address identified  energy requirements.  LDF preparation D Boroughs should work with the relevant energy companies to establish   the future gas and electricity infrastructure needs arising from the  development of their area and address them in their local plans.  Boroughs should cooperate across boundaries (including outside  Greater London where appropriate) to identify and address potential  capacity shortfalls in the wider energy network serving their area.     T H E  LO N D O N  P L A N  m A R C H  2 0 1 6  187  5.31A Electricity and gas infrastructure is essential for the functioning of any modern  city. The relevant markets are complex with a range of stakeholders involved in  the planning of required gas and electricity distribution capacity and different  companies covering different parts of London. In addition, National Grid is  responsible for energy transmission infrastructure.  Electricity Supply  5.31B UK Power Networks (UKPN) is London’s main Distribution Network Operator (DNO)  for electricity serving all except the London boroughs of Hillingdon, Hounslow and  Ealing. Scottish and Southern Energy serves these boroughs. UKPN is responsible  for distributing electricity from National Grid’s Grid Supply Points to London’s  homes and businesses.  5.31C The high level of network utilisation, especially in central London, is a particular  concern because of the level of development required to accommodate  anticipated population and business growth. According to UKPN, some of the  large buildings being built in London have a maximum demand equivalent to a town  with a population of around 50,000. It is expected that at least in the short term,  electricity demand could increase by up to 4 per cent annually. A mechanism has  therefore been put in place to provide UKPN with regular, up-to-date information  from the London Development Database to ensure that their demand forecasts are  as robust as possible.  5.31D There are concerns over the potential lack of strategic investment ahead of  specific connection requests and the need to facilitate more cost-effective  and timely connection of developments to the network. The current regulatory  framework does not fully address demands likely to be generated by London’s  distinct levels of growth and density. The Mayor has therefore established a  London Electricity High-level Working Group175 to investigate requirements for  more strategic provision of electricity infrastructure in advance of need.   5.31E Boroughs and DNOs should work together to assess future capacity requirements  and constraints so that land for new electricity distribution infrastructure can be  identified strategically and efficiently in advance. It is particularly important to  avoid situations arising where the viability and space use of new development  proposals are constrained disproportionately because inadequate account has   175 This initiative emerged from the Mayor’s Electricity Summit in November 2012 and marked the starting  point of a commitment to on-going, closer co-operation with the electricity industry, its regulator, the  development and business sectors and interested local authorities. In addition, the High-level Working  Group supports decentralised energy and demand management since they help to reduce the need for  additional infrastructure investment. Further details about the Working Group can be found at: https:// www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/planning/who-we-work/planning-working-groups/london-electricity- working-group   Where land is required for infrastructure, boroughs should allocate  suitable sites.    188 T H E  LO N D O N  P L A N  m A R C H  2 0 1 6  been taken of the cumulative effect of earlier development on infrastructure  capacity. Account should also be taken of the cumulative impact of anticipated  developments on electricity transmission infrastructure requirements.  Gas Supply  5.31F Two companies share London’s gas distribution network. National Grid serves  the area north of the Thames as well as Battersea to Lambeth, and Southern Gas  Networks the area south of the Thames. National Grid owns and operates the high- pressure transmission system, which transports gas from terminals to the two  distribution networks, which operate at lower pressure.  5.31G Partly because of improvements in operational efficiency, the industry is  currently not expecting a general increase in gas demand. However, alongside  the continuing programme of replacing old metal gas mains, local infrastructure  improvements may be required to supply growth areas such as Opportunity Areas.  This may also require the provision of new pressure reduction stations.  5. 31H There are numerous low-pressure gasholders in London. Only a few are still  operational and both gas distribution companies pursue de-commissioning  strategies, which will result in brownfield land becoming available for development.  The Mayor will work with them to prioritise de-commissioning of those gasholder  sites which have significant potential to contribute to the provision of new homes  and jobs on and around them. Planning guidance for hazardous installations (see  Policy 5.22) will be prepared in cooperation with relevant stakeholders including  the Health and Safety Executive to facilitate the de-commissioning process.    POLICy 5.5 DECENTRALISED ENERgy NETwORkS   Strategic A The Mayor expects 25 per cent of the heat and power used in London   to be generated through the use of localised decentralised energy  systems by 2025. In order to achieve this target the Mayor prioritises  the development of decentralised heating and cooling networks at  the development and area wide levels, including larger scale heat  transmission networks.   LDF preparation B Within LDFs boroughs should develop policies and proposals to identify   and establish decentralised energy network opportunities. Boroughs  may choose to develop this as a supplementary planning document and  work jointly with neighbouring boroughs to realise wider decentralised  energy network opportunities. As a minimum boroughs should:  a identify and safeguard existing heating and cooling networks b identify opportunities for expanding existing networks and   establishing new networks. Boroughs should use the London Heat     T H E  LO N D O N  P L A N  m A R C H  2 0 1 6  189  5.32 The Mayor supports the greater use of renewable and low carbon generation  technologies, and has set a target for London to generate 25 per cent of its heat  and power requirements through the use of local, decentralised energy (DE)  systems by 2025. DE generates power at point of use, making more efficient use  of primary energy by utilising generated heat that would otherwise be wasted in  large-scale thermal power generation plants. Supported by planned development,  London’s future district heating networks will evolve from natural gas CHP to being  supplied by energy from waste. Depending on future technologies, the systems  could mature into low temperature networks taking advantage of low grade  surplus heat, minimising the need for primary energy input. Renewable energy DE  opportunities including the use of energy from waste and biomass schemes are  also supported. Shifting 25 per cent of London’s energy demand to be supplied  through decentralised systems could save up to 2.57 million tonnes of carbon  dioxide a year. Greater use of DE will also help London become more self-sufficient  and secure in relation to its energy needs.  Map tool and consider any new developments, planned major  infrastructure works and energy supply opportunities which may  arise  c develop energy master plans for specific decentralised energy  opportunities which identify:  – major heat loads (including anchor heat loads, with particular   reference to sites such as universities, hospitals and social  housing)  – major heat supply plant – possible opportunities to utilise energy from waste – possible heating and cooling network routes – implementation options for delivering feasible projects,   considering issues of procurement, funding and risk and the  role of the public sector  d require developers to prioritise connection to existing or planned  decentralised energy networks where feasible.     190 T H E  LO N D O N  P L A N  m A R C H  2 0 1 6  5.33 London has the potential to increase its DE capacity ten-fold176. The Mayor is  working to stimulate a major increase in investment in the necessary district  energy infrastructure required to maximise the opportunities it can deliver. Map 5.1  shows heat demand density across London, which when used in conjunction with  other relevant spatial factors (such as social housing density, major development  and regeneration areas) can help identify opportunities for DE networks (see  paragraph 5.35).   5.34 Some boroughs have already undertaken technical and financial feasibility work  to progress district-wide heat and power schemes, and it is expected all boroughs  will actively promote DE in their LDFs. This will enable systematic identification of  key opportunities across London for different types of DE systems. The scale of  opportunity can vary from CHP systems on specific development sites, through  town centre wide district energy projects such as Elephant and Castle and the  Olympic Park/Village schemes, to connecting into large scale infrastructure such  as the London Thames Gateway Heat Network. This could ultimately extend to 23  kilometres and supply the heat requirements of 120,000 homes and properties,   176 DEFRA. Analysis of the UK potential for Combined Heat and Power.

Boroughs  and others (including developers) are encouraged to update information to this  tool and utilise the heat map to develop more detailed local energy masterplans.  The tool continues to be developed and updated as boroughs and others  add further information into the map on heat loads, heat supply plants and  networks in their areas. The Mayor and London Councils have also developed a  comprehensive decentralised energy masterplanning support package, tailored  to boroughs’ individual requirements and ranging from organisational capacity  building to the identification, development and implementation of specific  projects.  5.36 Boroughs should work with significant energy users, potential energy providers  and Energy Services Companies (ESCOs)178 to identify and develop DE network  opportunities. Where an opportunity for a DE network is taken forward, the  borough should connect its own buildings to the network wherever possible  and identify potential sites for energy centres on either council owned land or in  buildings. The GLA are developing decentralised energy technical specifications  and standards in conjunction with the boroughs and other relevant stakeholders  to ensure compatibility between decentralised energy networks as they  are developed in London. Boroughs are encouraged to make use of these  specifications and standards when developing network opportunities in their  borough. They may also wish to explore the use of local development orders  (LDOs) for implementation purposes. Further information on proposals to support  the wider uptake of DE systems in London can be found in the Mayor’s Climate  Change Mitigation and Energy Strategy.  177 Details can be found on the Energy Masterplan for London website: www.emplondon.org.uk   178 London Energy Partnership.

LEP, 2007   POLICy 5.6 DECENTRALISED ENERgy IN DEVELOPmENT PROPOSALS  Planning decisions A Development proposals should evaluate the feasibility of Combined   Heat and Power (CHP) systems, and where a new CHP system is  appropriate also examine opportunities to extend the system beyond  the site boundary to adjacent sites.  B Major development proposals should select energy systems in  accordance with the following hierarchy:  1 Connection to existing heating or cooling networks; 2 Site wide CHP network; 3 Communal heating and cooling;     192 T H E  LO N D O N  P L A N  m A R C H  2 0 1 6  5.37 Development proposals should seek to connect to existing or planned DE  networks. Linking a new development to an existing CHP system may be the  most resource efficient option, allowing more effective use to be made of heat,  power and cooling. If it is not possible to link to an existing system, the feasibility  of CHP needs to be considered on a site-wide basis connecting different uses  and/or group of buildings or an individual building. Investment in heat and cooling  distribution infrastructure should be considered in all developments. CHP systems  must be designed to run efficiently and be optimally sized to maximise carbon  dioxide savings.   5.38 Opportunities to incorporate energy from waste or, where technically feasible,  renewable energy should be investigated. However, the design of such systems  should also seek to minimise impacts on air quality (see Policy 7.14). Where a  district CHP system provides part of a development’s power and/or heating and/ or cooling demand, suitable renewable energy technologies should be considered  in addition, in accordance with Policy 5.7 and the Mayor’s energy hierarchy. In this  area of policy, as all others, feasibility includes questions of financial and technical  viability. There are recognised ways of identifying and assessing these. These will  ensure that requirements are not imposed on the development that could lead to  uneconomic costs on occupiers.   POLICy 5.7 RENEwAbLE ENERgy  Strategic A The Mayor seeks to increase the proportion of energy generated from   renewable sources, and expects that the projections for installed  renewable energy capacity outlined in the Climate Change Mitigation  and Energy Strategy and in supplementary planning guidance will be  achieved in London.  Planning decisions B Within the framework of the energy hierarchy (see Policy 5.2), major   development proposals should provide a reduction in expected  carbon dioxide emissions through the use of on-site renewable energy  generation, where feasible.  LDF preparation C Within LDFs boroughs should, and other agencies may wish to, develop   more detailed policies and proposals to support the development of  renewable energy in London – in particular, to identify broad areas  where specific renewable energy technologies, including large scale   C Potential opportunities to meet the first priority in this hierarchy  are outlined in the London Heat Map tool. Where future network  opportunities are identified, proposals should be designed to connect  to these networks.     T H E  LO N D O N  P L A N  m A R C H  2 0 1 6  193  5.39 Use of renewable energy presents a significant opportunity to reduce carbon  dioxide emissions, and its development will also contribute to the security of  energy supply in London. Energy generated from waste provides a particularly  significant opportunity for London to exploit in the future. Preference should be  given to using advanced conversion technologies including anaerobic digestion,  gasification and pyrolysis (see glossary) that have the potential to achieve greater  efficiencies and carbon dioxide emissions savings.   5.40 The Mayor has outlined in the Climate Change Mitigation and Energy Strategy  projections for the installation of different renewable energy technologies to  increase London’s generation of both electricity and heat from such sources up to  2031. These projections will be supported by supplementary planning guidance.  The Government has adopted a UK wide target for 15 per cent of total energy to  be generated by renewable sources by 2020, and these projections represent  London’s contribution to this 2020 target and beyond. Further detail is set out in  the Climate Change Mitigation Strategy and alterations to the Plan will be brought  forward as appropriate.  5.41 Boroughs are encouraged to identify opportunities for developing renewable  energy systems in their areas, including large scale systems. Where land is needed  for the provision of renewable energy technologies, such as anaerobic digesters  and biomass plants, boroughs should encourage this provision through their  inclusion in development briefs and area action plans. The Mayor’s supplementary  planning guidance will set out broad guidelines to assist boroughs and, where  appropriate, neighbourhoods, to define locations where stand-alone renewable  energy schemes would be appropriate. The increased use of renewable heat  will also significantly depend on the growth of heat networks. The Mayor and  Boroughs will also encourage community-led initiatives for renewables and low  carbon energy and examine how they can be supported through neighbourhood  planning (see Policy 7.1).  5.42 Individual development proposals will also help to achieve these targets by  applying the energy hierarchy in Policy 5.2. There is a presumption that all major  development proposals will seek to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by at least  20 per cent through the use of on-site renewable energy generation wherever  feasible. Development proposals should seek to utilise renewable energy  technologies such as: biomass heating; cooling and electricity; renewable energy  from waste; photovoltaics; solar water heating; wind and heat pumps. The Mayor   systems and the large scale deployment of small scale systems, are  appropriate. The identification of areas should be consistent with any  guidelines and criteria outlined by the Mayor.  D All renewable energy systems should be located and designed to  minimise any potential adverse impacts on biodiversity, the natural  environment and historical assets, and to avoid any adverse impacts on  air quality.    194 T H E  LO N D O N  P L A N  m A R C H  2 0 1 6  encourages the use of a full range of renewable energy technologies, which should  be incorporated wherever site conditions make them feasible and where they  contribute to the highest overall and most cost effective carbon dioxide emissions  savings for a development proposal.   5.43 Use of alternatives to traditional fossil fuels is a way to help improve air quality,  reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve energy security. Opportunities  to develop the more widespread use of alternative energy sources include  supporting emerging technologies and innovations, and supporting the  development of supply chains, infrastructure and associated skill requirements.   5.44 Road vehicles account for around 80 per cent of transport related carbon  dioxide emissions, and the Mayor wants to accelerate uptake of greener fuels  and vehicles to address this. Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles are being trialled in  London and the Mayor actively supports the greater deployment of electric  vehicles. Hybrid vehicles are already widely available and offer carbon dioxide  emissions reductions of around 30 per cent over vehicles running on fossil fuels.  Electric vehicles emit much less carbon dioxide and other pollutants compared  to conventional cars, and have zero emissions at point of use. To promote their  uptake the Mayor has set up the London Electric Vehicle Partnership and has  published an Electric Vehicle Delivery Plan for London. Policy 6.13 also requires  the provision of electrical charging points in new developments as part of parking  provision requirements.   5.45 The Mayor will work with the London Hydrogen Partnership, boroughs and others  to support the development of a Hydrogen Action Plan, and the development of  energy infrastructure based on hydrogen as a principal energy carrier. The Mayor  will encourage boroughs to identify capacity for such infrastructure. Advanced   POLICy 5.8 INNOVATIVE ENERgy TECHNOLOgIES   Strategic A The Mayor supports and encourages the more widespread use of   innovative energy technologies to reduce use of fossil fuels and  carbon dioxide emissions. In particular the Mayor will seek to work with  boroughs and other partners in this respect, for example by stimulating:  a the uptake of electric and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles b hydrogen supply and distribution infrastructure c the uptake of advanced conversion technologies such as anaerobic   digestion, gasification and pyrolysis for the treatment of waste. LDF preparation B Within LDFs boroughs may wish to develop more detailed policies   and proposals to support the use of alternative energy technologies  (particularly in infrastructure and masterplanning opportunities).    T H E  LO N D O N  P L A N  m A R C H  2 0 1 6  195  conversion technologies for treating waste can be linked to highly efficient energy  generation methods such as gas engines and hydrogen fuel cells to achieve  greater greenhouse gas savings. Through his chairmanship of the London Waste  and Recycling Board, the Mayor will allocate funding to projects supporting the  development of advanced conversion technologies in London. The Mayor has  also set up a Food to Fuel Alliance Programme to promote the development of  exemplar projects turning London’s food waste into renewable energy including  renewable transport fuel.  Climate change adaptation  5.46 All developments should make the fullest contribution to London’s adaptation to  climate change and should be designed for the warmer, wetter winters and hotter,  drier summers the city will experience over their lifetime, and to withstand possible  natural hazards (such as heatwaves, flooding and droughts) that may occur.  The following policies are supported by the London Climate Change Adaptation  Strategy that contains further proposals to help London adapt to the major  impacts of climate change.    POLICy 5.9 OVERHEATINg AND COOLINg  Strategic A The Mayor seeks to reduce the impact of the urban heat island effect   in London and encourages the design of places and spaces to avoid  overheating and excessive heat generation, and to reduce overheating  due to the impacts of climate change and the urban heat island effect  on an area wide basis.  Planning decisions B Major development proposals should reduce potential overheating   and reliance on air conditioning systems and demonstrate this in  accordance with the following cooling hierarchy:  1 minimise internal heat generation through energy efficient design 2 reduce the amount of heat entering a building in summer through   orientation, shading, albedo, fenestration, insulation and green  roofs and walls  3 manage the heat within the building through exposed internal  thermal mass and high ceilings  4 passive ventilation 5 mechanical ventilation  6 active cooling systems (ensuring they are the lowest carbon   options). C Major development proposals should demonstrate how the   design, materials, construction and operation of the development     196 T H E  LO N D O N  P L A N  m A R C H  2 0 1 6  5.47 London will experience higher average temperatures. This is likely to intensify the  urban heat island effect – the way higher ambient temperatures are experienced  after sunset in urban areas in comparison with rural areas. This is most intense  at night and in London is principally experienced within the Central Activities  Zone, as buildings and roads absorb more solar radiation than green space and  vegetation. Combined with man-made heat emissions, this can make the centre  of London up to eight degrees warmer than the Green Belt on hot summer nights.  The GLA is developing with the Chartered Institute of Building Services Engineers  (CIBSE) guidance for developers to address the risk of overheating in buildings.  The guidance will allow developers to take a risk-based approach to reducing  overheating by providing different future hourly weather data to use in building  simulation models. These take account of the location of the development with  respect to the urban heat island and how sensitive the proposed use of the  development is to overheating. The Mayor encourages the use of this guidance in  the preparation of development proposals.  5.48 The cooling hierarchy in Policy 5.9 seeks to reduce any potential overheating and  also the need to cool a building through active cooling measures. Air conditioning  systems are a very resource intensive form of active cooling, increasing carbon  dioxide emissions, and also emitting large amounts of heat into the surrounding  area. By incorporating the cooling hierarchy into the design process buildings will  be better equipped to manage their cooling needs and to adapt to the changing  climate they will experience over their lifetime.   5.49 In accordance with sustainable design and construction principles, development  proposals should maximise opportunities to orientate buildings and streets to  minimise summer and maximise winter solar gain; use trees and other shading;  increase green areas in the envelope of a building, including its roof and environs  (see Policy 5.11); maximise natural ventilation; expand green networks across  London (see Policy 2.18); and wherever possible incorporate a range of public  and/or private outdoor green spaces. The Mayor fully supports urban greening  initiatives and further policies are outlined below and in Chapter 7.  would minimise overheating and also meet its cooling needs. New  development in London should also be designed to avoid the need for  energy intensive air conditioning systems as much as possible. Further  details and guidance regarding overheating and cooling are outlined in  the London Climate Change Adaptation Strategy.  LDF preparation D Within LDFs boroughs should develop more detailed policies and   proposals to support the avoidance of overheating and to support the  cooling hierarchy.    T H E  LO N D O N  P L A N  m A R C H  2 0 1 6  197  5.50 The Mayor has an ambitious programme to plant another 10,000 street trees by  2015, and wishes to see an additional two million trees in London by 2025 to help  with both mitigation of and adaptation to climate change. Urban greening is also  a key element of the much broader Climate Change Adaptation Strategy, which  encourages the use of planting, green roofs and walls and soft landscaping. The  research undertaken in the LUCID programme (The Development of a Local Urban  Climate Model and its Application to the Intelligent Design of Cities)179 has worked  towards providing information on reductions in temperature in London that could  be achieved by the addition of different types of urban greening.  5.51 London experienced a heatwave in 2003 that killed at least 600 people and its  impact was exacerbated by the urban heat island effect. Cooling the urban  environment through the use of green infrastructure, as part of a package of  measures to combat climate change, will have important health and social  benefits. It is particularly important to address the urban heat island effect in  central London. Further work will be undertaken to establish a methodology by  which major developments can be assessed for the contribution that they will  need to make to increasing green infrastructure in the Central Activities Zone.   179 Further information on: www.lucid-project.org.uk  POLICy 5.10 uRbAN gREENINg  Strategic  A The Mayor will promote and support urban greening, such as new   planting in the public realm (including streets, squares and plazas) and  multifunctional green infrastructure, to contribute to the adaptation to,  and reduction of, the effects of climate change.   B The Mayor seeks to increase the amount of surface area greened in the  Central Activities Zone by at least five per cent by 2030, and a further  five per cent by 20501.  Planning decisions C Development proposals should integrate green infrastructure from   the beginning of the design process to contribute to urban greening,  including the public realm. Elements that can contribute to this include  tree planting, green roofs and walls, and soft landscaping. Major  development proposals within the Central Activities Zone should  demonstrate how green infrastructure has been incorporated.  LDF preparation D Boroughs should identify areas where urban greening and green   infrastructure can make a particular contribution to mitigating the  effects of climate change, such as the urban heat island.   1 Mayor of London. Leading to a Greener London. GLA, 2009    198 T H E  LO N D O N  P L A N  m A R C H  2 0 1 6  Research undertaken in Manchester has shown that increasing urban green space  by 10 per cent can help to cool high density areas of the city by around three to  four degrees centigrade180. Urban greening also contributes to achieving a  network of green multifunctional infrastructure across London with the  consequent range of benefits that this can bring (see Policy 2.18).  5.52 Green roofs are an essential sustainable design consideration and can take many  forms in order to maximise their benefits in a given location. However, the design  and operational needs of a green roof should not place undue stress on water  supply and other natural resources. Vegetated roofs, including terraces and  gardens, can improve the thermal performance of the building, reduce the urban  heat island effect, support sustainable urban drainage by absorbing rainfall to  reduce flooding, enhance biodiversity, provide amenity for residents who may not  have access to private gardens, provide opportunities to grow food and improve  appearance.   5.53 High quality designs for green walls incorporating vegetation over a majority of  a building’s vertical surfaces should also be considered in new developments.  The Mayor’s supplementary guidance on Sustainable Design and Construction  contains further guidance on including green space in development proposals.  180 Climate Change and Cities: the Role of Green Infrastructure.

LDF preparation B Within LDFs boroughs may wish to develop more detailed policies and   proposals to support the development of green roofs and the greening  of development sites.

Planning decisions B Development proposals must comply with the flood risk assessment   and management requirements set out in the NPPF and the associated  technical Guidance on flood risk1 over the lifetime of the development  and have regard to measures proposed in Thames Estuary 2100  (TE2100 – see paragraph 5.55) and Catchment Flood Management  Plans.   C Developments which are required to pass the Exceptions Test set out  in the NPPF and the Technical Guidance will need to address flood  resilient design and emergency planning by demonstrating that:  a the development will remain safe and operational under flood  conditions  b a strategy of either safe evacuation and/or safely remaining in the  building is followed under flood conditions  c key services including electricity, water etc will continue to be  provided under flood conditions  d buildings are designed for quick recovery following a flood. D Development adjacent to flood defences will be required to protect the   integrity of existing flood defences and wherever possible should aim  to be set back from the banks of watercourses and those defences to  allow their management, maintenance and upgrading to be undertaken  in a sustainable and cost effective way.  LDF preparation E In line with the NPPF and the Technical Guidance, boroughs should,   when preparing LDFs, utilise Strategic Flood Risk Assessments to  identify areas where particular flood risk issues exist and develop  actions and policy approaches aimed at reducing these risks,  particularly through redevelopment of sites at risk of flooding and  identifying specific opportunities for flood risk management measures.  1 Technical Guidance to the National Planning Policy Framework, Department for Communities and  Local Government, March 2012 or any subsequent guidance on flood risk issued in support of the  NPPF    200 T H E  LO N D O N  P L A N  m A R C H  2 0 1 6  5.54 Proper consideration of flood risk is vital to ensuring that London is and continues  to be a sustainable city. Approximately 15 per cent of London is already within a  recognised flood risk zone from either tidal or fluvial flooding. The Regional Flood  Risk Appraisal (RFRA) produced alongside this Plan, investigates flood risk in more  detail and identifies that London is at risk from tidal, fluvial, surface water, sewer,  groundwater (see Glossary) and reservoir flooding as sources of flooding. It includes  recommendations that will be reported against in the Annual Monitoring Report.  5.55 The Government has endorsed the Environment Agency’s Thames Estuary 2100  (TE2100) Plan, which sets out recommendations for tidal flood risk management  for London and the Thames Estuary up to 2100. TE2100 recommends continued  maintenance, refurbishment and improvements to the current defences, with some  raising of river walls. This should continue to provide London with a high standard  of protection from tidal floods. TE2100 estimates that the arrangements for major  changes to London’s flood defences must be in place by 2070. In order to leave  room to raise river walls in a sustainable and cost effective way, some land may  have to be safeguarded, and development may need to be set back along the  Thames through London. If land is not available, the walls will reduce views across  the river and they will be much more expensive to build. There also remains a level  of risk, equivalent to 0.1 per cent chance per year – a low risk but not one that  could never happen. This means it is still vital at the planning and design stage to  consider what would happen to buildings if such a flood were to occur.   5.56 Fluvial flood risk is likely to increase significantly through the century, as a result of  climate change. Predictions of increases in peak flows of up to 40 per cent would  mean that we would have to expect increased flood risk on all of London’s tributary  rivers. The Environment Agency has produced Catchment Flood Management  Plans that examine the nature of flood risk and the approaches available to  manage it. These reinforce the need to follow the approach of steering  development to places with lower flooding risk and that new development and  redevelopment can often provide a means of reducing flood risk for example by  providing flood storage/conveyance or setting development back from rivers.  POLICy 5.13 SuSTAINAbLE DRAINAgE  Planning decisions A Development should utilise sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDS)   unless there are practical reasons for not doing so, and should aim to  achieve greenfield run-off rates and ensure that surface water run-off  is managed as close to its source as possible in line with the following  drainage hierarchy:  1 store rainwater for later use 2 use infiltration techniques, such as porous surfaces in non-clay   areas 3 attenuate rainwater in ponds or open water features for gradual     T H E  LO N D O N  P L A N  m A R C H  2 0 1 6  201  5.57 There will also be increased surface water flood risk, with the likelihood of  more intense storms. The Flood and Water Management Act 2010 gives  London boroughs clearer responsibilities related to surface water flood risk.  Implementation mechanisms including the national Sustainable Drainage Systems  Standards are emerging. Moreover, the Drain London Forum brings together the  key agencies involved in managing London’s drainage system and has delivered  draft Surface Water Management Plans for every London borough. As the RFRA  illustrates, it has also made significant progress in the understanding of surface  water flood risk. In the meantime, the now well established sustainable drainage  hierarchy contained within Policy 5.13 will lead to a steady reduction in the overall  amount of rainfall being discharged to the drainage system. The sustainable  drainage hierarchy in policy 5.13A is intended to ensure that all practical and  reasonable measures are taken to manage surface water higher up the hierarchy  (1 being the highest) and that the amount of surface water managed at the  bottom of the hierarchy, is minimised. The hierarchy is designed to apply across  the whole of London. In addition, green roofs (see Policy 5.11) can also make a  contribution to sustainable urban drainage by absorbing a proportion of surface  water and therefore reducing rates of water flow. Implementing such measures  will not only reduce run-off but provide multiple benefits to London amenity,  biodiversity and better water quality to name but three. Changes to the General  Permitted Development Order 2008 restricting permitted development rights  for impermeable surfaces within the curtilage of dwelling houses should also  contribute to a reduction of surface water run-off.  release  4 attenuate rainwater by storing in tanks or sealed water features for   gradual release 5 discharge rainwater direct to a watercourse  6 discharge rainwater to a surface water sewer/drain 7 discharge rainwater to the combined sewer. Drainage should be designed and implemented in ways that deliver  other policy objectives of this Plan, including water use efficiency and  quality, biodiversity, amenity and recreation.  LDF preparation B Within LDFs boroughs should, in line with the Flood and Water   Management Act 2010, utilise Surface Water Management Plans to  identify areas where there are particular surface water management  issues and develop actions and policy approaches aimed at reducing  these risks.    202 T H E  LO N D O N  P L A N  m A R C H  2 0 1 6  5.58 Most of London’s waterbodies fail to achieve ‘good’ ecological status/ potential  as set out in the Thames River Basin Management Plan. This sets out the  requirements of the Water Framework Directive. Sources of pollution include  misconnections of sewerage to surface water drains, contaminated run-off  and storm sewerage. Spatial planning measures helping to improve London’s  waterbodies are reflected throughout this Plan (see in particular policies 2.18, 5.10,  5.13, 5.14, 5.15, 7.18 and 7.24). Effective wastewater infrastructure is fundamental  to sustainable urban life and therefore investment and expansion are required.  Currently, Thames Water is implementing plans for additional sewage treatment  capacity at several major works, including additional capacity for the treatment of,  and energy recovery from, sewage sludge. While the impacts of these works need  to be minimised and mitigated, it is nevertheless essential that a positive planning  approach is in place to support this investment.  5.59 In 2007, the Government approved construction of the Thames Tideway Sewer  Tunnels in two phases (Lee Valley to Beckton and west London to Beckton). For the   POLICy 5.14 wATER quALITy AND wASTEwATER INFRASTRuCTuRE  Strategic A The Mayor will work in partnership with the boroughs, appropriate   agencies within London and adjoining local planning authorities to:  a ensure that London has adequate and appropriate wastewater  infrastructure to meet the requirements placed upon it by  population growth and climate change   b protect and improve water quality having regard to the Thames  River Basin Management Plan.  Planning decisions B Development proposals must ensure that adequate wastewater   infrastructure capacity is available in tandem with development.  Proposals that would benefit water quality, the delivery of the policies  in this Plan and of the Thames River Basin Management Plan should be  supported while those with adverse impacts should be refused.  C Development proposals to upgrade London’s sewage (including sludge)  treatment capacity should be supported provided they utilise best  available techniques and energy capture.  D The development of the Thames Tideway Sewer Tunnels to address  London’s combined sewer overflows should be supported in principle.  LDF preparation  E Within LDFs boroughs should identify wastewater infrastructure   requirements and relevant boroughs should in principle support the  Thames Tideway Sewer Tunnels.

This will address the long term problem of  combined sewer overflows, which has resulted in the discharge of millions of  tonnes of untreated sewage into the Thames each year. This is a strategic project  for London. Opportunities to reduce the construction and operational impacts, the  overall energy demand and the costs of the project should be taken. In addition,  there are continuing programmes to deal with problems of sewer flooding in some  areas of London; these need to be completed and where required, the lack of  sewer capacity addressed.  181 Defra: National Policy Statement on Waste Water (March 2012), p 17 -21  POLICy 5.15 wATER uSE AND SuPPLIES  Strategic A The Mayor will work in partnership with appropriate agencies within   London and adjoining regional and local planning authorities to protect  and conserve water supplies and resources in order to secure London’s  needs in a sustainable manner by:  a minimising use of mains water b reaching cost-effective minimum leakage levels c in conjunction with demand side measures, promoting the provision   of additional sustainable water resources in a timely and efficient  manner, reducing the water supply deficit and achieving security of  supply in London  d minimising the amount of energy consumed in water supply e promoting the use of rainwater harvesting and using dual potable   and grey water recycling systems, where they are energy and cost- effective  f maintaining and upgrading water supply infrastructure g ensuring the water supplied will not give rise to likely significant   adverse effects to the environment particularly designated sites of  European importance for nature conservation.

London’s consumption of water already outstrips available supplies  in dry years and ensuing a sustainable and secure water supply has to be an  urgent priority. Some steps have already been taken. Investment in recent years  to reduce leakage from Victorian mains supply pipes has had an effect (although  Thames Water still has a significantly higher leakage rate than the rest of the  country). An additional source of supply, the desalination plant at Beckton, has  been operational since 2010. These two measures have eased the pressure on  water resources in London.  5.61 But the fundamental problem remains. To remain sustainable, London needs  to reduce the level of water consumption per person. Currently the average  Londoner consumes 164 litres/day (l/d)182, around 20 l/d above the national  average. Projections for population growth in London and in the wider south east  will mean that over the period of this Plan, new strategic water resources will be  required. The need for this is exacerbated by the climate change predictions of  more sporadic and intense rainfall and a higher likelihood of droughts as well  as the need to protect the water environment implementing the Thames River  Basin Management Plan requirements. Thames Water, which provides over  three-quarters of Londoners with water, projects a significant (around 6 % by  2020) capacity deficit. To ensure London’s future water security, the prudent use  of water will be essential: all new development will need to be water efficient.  Residential development should be designed so that mains water consumption  would meet a target of 105 litres or less per head per day, excluding an allowance  of 5 litres or less per head per day for external water use. This reflects the  ‘optional requirement’ set out in Part G of the Building Regulations183. As all  water companies that serve London are located in areas classified as seriously  water stressed184, the ‘optional requirement’ should be applied across London. A  fittings-based approach should be used to determine the water consumption of  a development185. This approach is transparent and compatible with developers’  procurement and the emerging Water Label, which Government and the water  companies serving London are supporting.  5.61A Existing homes and workplaces will have to become more water efficient,  particularly through metering and water efficiency retrofits.

A rolling programme for the replacement of London’s  water mains will reduce wastage and London’s water companies will have to invest  in sustainable sources of water. Cooperation will be needed across boundaries  to identify and address potential capacity shortfalls of the wider network serving  their area. Further detail relating to London’s water and wastewater infrastructure  is contained in the Mayor’s Water Strategy.  5.62 The Mayor is committed to explore the concept of ‘water neutrality’ to help to  address these issues. The basic premise is that development should not lead to  an overall rise in demand for water. The definition of water neutrality used by the  Government and the Environment Agency is: “For every new development, total water use across the wider area after the  development must be equal to or less than total water use across the wider area  before development.”  The Mayor is working with the water companies to promote in particular demand  management measures in their Water Resource Management Plans and Business  Plans.   5.63 Alternative sources of water, such as rainwater and greywater, particularly for uses  other than drinking, will be increasingly important to reducing our consumption  of mains water. It is important to have a positive planning approach to providing a  more sustainable and secure water supply infrastructure.  5.64 After major industrial abstractions of groundwater stopped, parts of London  (including the Underground, basements and underground services) were at risk  of groundwater flooding. This issue has now been addressed with abstractions at  additional Thames Water boreholes. It is currently thought that groundwater levels  will not be particularly affected by climate change. The position will be monitored,  and alterations to the London Plan will be brought forward if necessary.  Waste  5.65  The Mayor is committed to a policy framework for waste management which starts  from the position the best approach is to reduce the amount of waste that arises  in the first place.  Where this is not possible, he supports an approach based on  the waste hierarchy that emphasises re-use, and then recycling and composting,  before energy recovery and disposal. Generally, applying the waste hierarchy will  achieve the greatest carbon dioxide equivalent savings. However, there are certain  circumstances where the waste hierarchy conflicts with achieving the greatest  climate change mitigation benefits. For example, depending on the condition  of wood, it may be better to generate energy using wood waste rather than to  recycle it. In these cases the approach that will deliver the greater climate change  mitigation benefits should be given preference. This Plan, and the Mayor’s waste  strategies, set out policies to achieve this.    206 T H E  LO N D O N  P L A N  m A R C H  2 0 1 6  5.66 The Mayor believes that making better use of waste has a major role to play in  tackling climate change and that London’s waste is a valuable resource that  should be exploited for London’s benefit, and not solely a disposal problem.  London cannot deal with these issues in isolation. The Mayor works closely  with neighbouring regions and local authorities to ensure these challenges and  opportunities are addressed in the most environmentally friendly and effective  ways possible. London has a leading part to play in ensuring this.   5.67 With this in mind, London should manage as much of the capital’s waste within  its boundaries as practicable, enabling London and Londoners to receive  environmental and economic benefits from its management. The Mayor  acknowledges that waste contracts do not recognise administrative boundaries  and that waste flows across borders. Consequently the aim of his waste policies  is to achieve net self-sufficiency for household and commercial waste by 2026. If  achieved, this would mean enough sites are identified within London to deal with  the equivalent of 100% of the waste apportioned to the boroughs as set out in  Table 5.3, regardless of the waste’s origin. PPS10 requires the Mayor to apportion  Household and Commercial Waste to each borough (see Table 5.3). PPS10 does  not require the Mayor to apportion Construction, Excavation and Demolition  Waste, consequently the Mayor has not done so. Hazardous Waste is not an  additional waste stream on top of Household and Commercial waste but a subset  of these waste streams.   5.67A The Mayor believes that reducing waste, boosting reuse and recycling  performance and generating low carbon energy from non-recyclable waste will  deliver environmental and economic benefits to London. The Mayor recognises  that in the short term waste may be exported outside of London – including  Europe – whilst London markets are established. In all cases this should only be  considered as an interim option with commercial agreements reflecting the  ambition to maximise management of the capital’s waste within its boundaries.  Equally, the Mayor encourages the flow of appropriate materials into London  where economically beneficial.  Policy 5.16 Waste net self-sufficiency  Strategic  A The Mayor will work with London boroughs and waste authorities, the   London Waste and Recycling Board (LWaRB), the Environment Agency,  the private sector, voluntary and community sector groups, and  neighbouring regions and authorities to:  a manage as much of London’s waste within London as practicable,  working towards managing the equivalent of 100% of London’s  waste within London by 2026  b create positive environmental and economic impacts from waste  processing    T H E  LO N D O N  P L A N  m A R C H  2 0 1 6  207  5.68 London produced about 15 million tonnes of waste in 2012. There are three major  types of waste produced in London:   •  household waste collected by or on behalf of local authorities, amounting to  approximately 3m tonnes (20 per cent of all waste)186  •  commercial & industrial waste (C&I) is waste generated by businesses and  industry in London, collected by the private sector and local authorities,  amounting to approximately 4.7m tonnes (32 per cent of all waste)187  •  construction, excavation and demolition waste (CE&D) is the waste  generated by development activity in London (for example, old buildings  being demolished, new ones being constructed), primarily dealt with by the  private sector and amounting to approximately 7.2m tonnes (48 per cent of all  waste)188.  5.69 The Mayor wants to see a step change in London’s reuse and recycling  performance. Although there have been considerable improvements in local  authority waste recycling rates (up from 8 per cent in 2001 to 30 per cent in  2012)189, the Mayor wishes to see an increase to 45 per cent by 2015 and then 50  per cent by 2020. There is also considerable variation in local authority recycling   186 DEFRA Local Authority Waste Management Statistics 2012. See glossary for definition of ‘household  waste’ (definition taken from Mayor’s Municipal Waste Management Strategy, Mayor of London,  November 2011)  187 GLA 2014 188 Ibid 189 DEFRA Local Authority Waste Management Statistics 2012  c work towards zero biodegradable or recyclable waste to landfill by  2026.  B This will be achieved by:  a minimising waste b encouraging the reuse of and reduction in the use of materials c exceeding recycling/composting levels in local authority collected   waste (LACW) of 45 per cent by 2015, 50 per cent by 2020 and  aspiring to achieve 60 per cent by 2031  d exceeding recycling/composting levels in commercial and industrial  waste of 70 per cent by 2020   e exceeding recycling and reuse levels in construction, excavation  and demolition (CE&D) waste of 95 per cent by 2020  f improving London’s net self-sufficiency through reducing the  proportion of waste exported from the capital over time  g working with neighbouring regional and district authorities to co- ordinate strategic waste management across the greater south  east of England.     208 T H E  LO N D O N  P L A N  m A R C H  2 0 1 6  performance across London, ranging in 2012 from 13 per cent to 48 per cent,  demonstrating that better performance is achievable. Overall, London reuses  or recycles 60 per cent of all waste190. Around 30 per cent of waste goes into  landfill sites that are located largely outside London191. It is estimated that London  currently manages 46 per cent (or 7 million tonnes) of its own waste, and imports a  further 2.6 million tonnes of waste each year.  5.70 Although this step change poses a big challenge, the proposed municipal waste  recycling targets match those set by the South London Waste Partnership, West  London Waste Authority, North London Waste Authority and the East London  Waste Authority, which together represent two-thirds of London’s municipal  waste authorities. The targets also recognise household waste recycling targets  that were set by two-thirds of London boroughs under local area agreements to  achieve, on average, 36 per cent recycling by 2011. Furthermore, DEFRA requires  boroughs to commit to 50 per cent household waste recycling performance  as a requirement for receiving Private Finance Initiative (PFI) credits for waste  procurement. The Mayor’s aspiration is for London to achieve 60 per cent  recycling of municipal waste by 2031. This performance level is supported by  research undertaken by WRAP showing that 85 per cent of household waste is  recyclable (including composting)192.   5.71 This Plan sets out the spatial policies to support the Mayor’s Waste Municipal and  Business Waste Strategies and includes its targets for recycling and reduction  of waste to landfill. Performance should improve for all forms of waste in London  in terms of greater efficiency of use, a reduction in amounts generated and an  increase in recycling. The greatest need and opportunity for improved performance  is local authority collected waste (LACW) from households and small businesses.  The Mayor believes that recycling and composting targets for commercial and  industrial waste are challenging but achievable, and reflects the current relatively  high level of commercial and industrial recycling, which in 2009 was estimated to  be 52 per cent. Recycling targets are carried forward from the 2011 version of the  London Plan. The Mayor is committed to working towards zero biodegradable or  recyclable waste to landfill by 2026.  5.72 The reduction of waste and the recycling targets included in this Plan and in the  Mayor’s Waste Strategies have a direct impact on London’s waste self-sufficiency.  5.73 The key objectives in terms of the spatial distribution of waste facilities within  London, as set out in PPS10: Planning for Sustainable Waste Management, are  that communities should take more responsibility for the management of their own  waste (self-sufficiency), and that waste should be disposed of in one of the nearest  appropriate installations (proximity). This means that waste planning authorities  should achieve the maximum degree of self-sufficiency possible commensurate   190 GLA 2014 191 ibid 192 Dr Julian Parfitt, Analysis of Household Waste Composition and Factors Driving Waste Increases   WRAP 2002    T H E  LO N D O N  P L A N  m A R C H  2 0 1 6  209  with their obligations for managing waste, while recognising that in some instances  the nearest appropriate installation might lie outside the Greater London boundary.  The Mayor, when determining local authority waste management contracts, will  adopt a flexible approach to self-sufficiency. In line with the objective of proximity,  preference may be given to facilities outside the Greater London boundary if they  are closest to the point of where the waste is produced. More detail on municipal  waste management contracts and self-sufficiency is set out in the Mayor’s  Municipal Waste Management Strategy.   5.74 The Mayor, through the London Waste Planning Forum193 continues to work  with London’s neighbours, in particular in the South East and East of England,  where most of London’s landfilled waste is exported to, to co-ordinate strategic  waste management across the regions to reduce the capital’s dependence on  landfill disposal outside London. He will adopt a flexible approach to how self- sufficiency is achieved, so that the carbon outcome of any treatment method and  transportation are given greater consideration in assessing proposals for waste   193 Formerly known as the London Regional Technical Advisory Board (RTAB)  POLICy 5.17 wASTE CAPACITy  Strategic  A The Mayor supports the need to increase waste processing capacity   in London. He will work with London boroughs and waste authorities  to identify opportunities for introducing new waste capacity, including  strategically important sites for waste management and treatment,  and resource recovery parks/consolidation centres, where recycling,  recovery and manufacturing activities can co-locate.  Planning decisions B Proposals for waste management should be evaluated against the   following criteria:  a locational suitability (see LDF preparation paragraphs F and G  below)  b proximity to the source of waste c the nature of activity proposed and its scale d minimising waste and achieving high reuse and recycling   performance e achieving a positive carbon outcome of waste treatment methods   and technologies (including the transportation of waste, recyclates  and waste derived products) resulting in greenhouse gas savings.  Facilities generating energy from waste will need to meet, or  demonstrate that steps are in place to meet, a minimum CO2eq  performance of 400 grams of CO2eq per kilowatt hour (kwh) of  electricity produced. Achieving this performance will ensure that     210 T H E  LO N D O N  P L A N  m A R C H  2 0 1 6  energy generated from waste activities is no more polluting in  carbon terms that the energy source it replaces (see paragraph  5.85 below).   f the environmental impact on surrounding areas, particularly noise  emissions, odour, air quality and visual impact and impact on water  resources  g the full transport and environmental impact of all collection,  transfer and disposal movements and, in particular, the scope to  maximise the use of rail and water transport using the Blue Ribbon  Network.  The following will be supported:  h developments that include a range of complementary waste  facilities on a single site  i developments for manufacturing related to recycled waste j developments that contribute towards renewable energy   generation, in particular the use of technologies that produce a  renewable gas  k developments for producing renewable energy from organic/ biomass waste.  C Wherever possible, opportunities should be taken to provide combined  heat and power and combined cooling heat and power.   D Developments adjacent to waste management sites should be designed  to minimise the potential for disturbance and conflicts of use.   E Suitable waste and recycling storage facilities are required in all new  developments.   LDF preparation F Boroughs must allocate sufficient land and identify waste management   facilities to provide capacity to manage the tonnages of waste  apportioned in this Plan. Boroughs may wish to collaborate by pooling  their apportionment requirements.   G Land to manage borough waste apportionments should be brought  forward through:  a protecting and facilitating the maximum use of existing waste sites,  particularly waste transfer facilities and landfill sites  b identifying sites in strategic industrial locations (see Policy 2.17) c identifying sites in locally significant employment areas (see Policy   4.4) d safeguarding wharves (in accordance with policy 7.26) with an   existing or future potential for waste management.  H If, for any reason, an existing waste management site is lost to non-  waste use, an additional compensatory site provision will be required  that normally meets the maximum throughput that the site could have  achieved.

The Mayor will work with all parties to achieve this. Through the London Waste  and Recycling Board (LWaRB), the Mayor will collaborate with boroughs and  other partners to make the capital a global beacon of best practice in waste  management.  5.77 PPS10 requires the Mayor through the London Plan to:  •  identify the tonnages of municipal and commercial/industrial waste requiring  management and to apportion them by waste planning authority area  •  evaluate the adequacy of existing strategically important waste management  and disposal facilities to meet London’s future needs, both for municipal and  other waste streams  •  identify the number and type of new or enhanced facilities required to meet  those needs  •  identify opportunities for the location of such facilities and, where appropriate,  criteria for the selection of sites.  5.78 Waste issues were thoroughly scrutinised in the London Plan Examinations in  Public in 2006, 2007 and 2010 and the Mayor sees no benefit in reopening recent  debates, particularly those around the borough-level apportionment methodology.  However, he has acknowledged that projected HH and C&I waste arisings at  borough level – the key to waste management, apportionment and self-sufficiency  – need updating. The GLA has accordingly brought forward new independently  reviewed borough-level projections of London’s waste arisings, and borough-level  apportionment of MSW and C&I waste using the 2007 methodology.  5.78A The revised figures, based on 2009/10 data194, show a 40 per cent drop in  commercial and industrial waste arisings apportioned compared with the 2011  London Plan figures. The Mayor acknowledges that although the new baseline  data may represent an underestimate of London’s waste arisings due to the  economic downturn, it is considered to be the most current and best available. The  Mayor will continue to monitor London’s waste arisings as updated data becomes  available for use in future iterations of the London Plan.  5.79 Table 5.2 gives projected HH and C&I arisings at borough level for key milestones  through to 2036. Table 5.3 sets out projected HH and C&I waste to be managed in  London apportioned to boroughs based on the methodology agreed for the 2008  version of the London Plan – ie each borough’s percentage share of waste to be  managed in London is the same as before. Waste is deemed to be managed in  London if:  •  it is used in London for energy recovery  194 DEFRA London C&I Waste Study 2010    212 T H E  LO N D O N  P L A N  m A R C H  2 0 1 6  20 16  20 21  20

The difference between apportioned and non-apportioned waste  tonnages is summarised in Table 5.4. It is expected that non-apportioned waste  will be exported.

Provided  the aggregated total apportionment figure is met, it is not necessary for boroughs  to meet both the municipal and commercial/ industrial waste apportionment figures  individually. Boroughs need to examine how capacity can be delivered in detail at  the local level as site allocations in LDFs to meet their apportionments. Boroughs  should aim to meet their waste apportionment as a minimum. Boroughs should  identify suitable additional sites for waste including waste transfer sites where  practicable. Boroughs working collaboratively must demonstrate that their joint  apportionment targets will be met, for example, through the preparation of joint  waste DPDs, joint evidence papers or bilateral agreements. Where a Mayoral  Development Corporation (MDC) exists or is established within a Borough the  MDC will co-operate with the Borough to ensure that the Borough’s apportionment  requirements are met.  5.81 Boroughs and waste authorities should identify sites which are potentially  suitable for a variety of technologies, depending on the particular site’s  opportunities and constraints, and assess how many facilities and what type of  waste processing facilities/technologies will be required locally to meet their  apportionments   5.82 It is envisaged that land in strategic industrial locations will provide the major  opportunities for locating waste treatment facilities (see Annex 3). Boroughs  should also look to locally significant industrial sites and existing waste  management sites. Existing waste management sites (including safeguarded  wharves with waste use or potential) should be clearly identified and safeguarded     T H E  LO N D O N  P L A N  m A R C H  2 0 1 6  215  for waste use. Suitable brownfield sites and contaminated land elsewhere may also  provide opportunities.   5.83 Allocations will need to balance the benefits of smaller, local sites against the  overall demand for land for waste and for a range of other activities in a situation  in which there are severe limitations of land supply, and against the benefits of  co-locating a range of facilities together in a smaller number of larger sites. The  Mayor will work with boroughs and waste authorities to identify opportunities for  introducing new waste capacity, including strategically important sites for waste  management and treatment, and resource recovery parks/ consolidation centres,  where recycling, recovery and manufacturing activities can co-locate.  5.84 For waste that cannot be recycled or composted (including anaerobic digestion),  the Mayor has a preference for waste processing technologies achieving the  greatest efficiencies but is keen that proposals for new facilities are evaluated by  carbon outcome (end-to-end) to ensure the best possible environmental impact.   5.85 To support the shift towards a low carbon economy the Mayor has developed a  minimum greenhouse gas performance for technologies generating energy from  London’s non-recyclable waste. This minimum performance, known as the carbon  intensity floor, has been set at 400 grams of CO2 eq generated per kilowatt hour  (kwh) of electricity generated. All facilities generating energy from London’s waste  will need to meet this level, or demonstrate they can practically meet it in the future  in order to gain Mayoral support. The GLA has developed a free on-line ready  reckoner tool to assist local authorities and applicants measuring and determining  greenhouse gas performance of waste management activities including waste- to-energy against the carbon intensity floor. This tool can be found at: http://www. london.gov.uk/priorities/environment/putting-waste-good-use/making-the-most- of-waste.   5.85A The carbon intensity floor has been set for waste-to-energy activities in London  to achieve at least a positive carbon outcome, whereby the direct emissions  from the technology are offset by emissions savings from the generation of low  carbon energy in the form of heat, electricity and transport fuel. This would, for  example rule out new mass burn incineration facilities of mixed waste generating  electricity only, but may allow combustion of waste with high biomass content  where both heat and power generated are used. This approach supports  technologies able to achieve high efficiencies particularly when linked with gas  engines and hydrogen fuel cells. More information on how the carbon intensity  floor has been developed and the ability to meet it can be found in Policy 2 of the  Mayor’s Municipal Waste Management Strategy. Waste to energy facilities should  be equipped with a heat off-take from the outset such that a future heat demand  can be supplied without the need to modify the heat producing plant in any way  or entail its unplanned shutdown. It should be demonstrated that capacity of  the heat off-take meets the carbon intensity floor at 100% heat supply. In order  to ensure the carbon intensity floor remains relevant, the Mayor will consider  reviewing the CIF level in future iterations of the London Plan.    216 T H E  LO N D O N  P L A N  m A R C H  2 0 1 6  5.85B Examples of ‘demonstrable steps’ as outlined in Policy 5.17 Be would be:  •  a commitment (via a Section 106 obligation) to deliver the necessary means  for infrastructure to meet the min CO2 standard, for example investment in the  development of a heat distribution network to the site boundary, or technology  modifications that improve plant efficiency;  •  an agreed timeframe (via a S106) as to when proposed measures will be  delivered;   •  the establishment of a working group to progress the agreed steps and monitor  and report performance to the consenting authority.   To assist in the delivery of ‘demonstrable steps’ the GLA can help to advise on heat  take-off opportunities for waste to energy projects, particularly where these are  linked to GLA supported Energy Master Plans.  5.86 Waste processing facilities, including materials recycling facilities and depots,  inert waste recycling plants, composting facilities, waste treatment and energy  recovery facilities, and reprocessing of recyclables, should be well designed.  They need not be bad neighbours and could be a source of new products and  new jobs. They should be developed and designed in consultation with local  communities, taking account of health and safety within the facility, the site and  adjoining neighbourhoods. Developments for manufacturing related to recycled  waste, deriving fuel from waste and recovering value from residual waste should  be supported. Where movement of waste is required, priority should be given to  facilities for movement by river or rail. Opportunities to provide combined heat and  power and combined cooling, heat and power should be taken wherever possible  (see Policies 5.5, 5.6 and 5.8). Developments adjacent to waste management sites  should be designed to minimise the potential for disturbance and conflicts of use.   5.87 Although no further landfill proposals in London are identified or anticipated in  the Plan, if proposals do come forward for new or extended landfill capacity or for  land-raising, boroughs should ensure that the resultant void-space has regard to   POLICy 5.18 CONSTRuCTION, ExCAVATION AND DEmOLITION wASTE  Planning decisions A New construction, excavation and demolition (CE&D) waste   management facilities should be encouraged at existing waste sites,  including safeguarded wharves, and supported by:   a using mineral extraction sites for CE&D recycling b ensuring that major development sites are required to recycle   CE&D waste on-site, wherever practicable, supported through  planning conditions.  B Waste should be removed from construction sites, and materials  brought to the site, by water or rail transport wherever that is     T H E  LO N D O N  P L A N  m A R C H  2 0 1 6  217  the Mayor’s Municipal Waste Strategy. 5.88 Re-use and recycling rates for construction, excavation and demolition   (CE&D) waste in London are already high – estimated at 82 per cent for 2008.  Nevertheless, the Mayor believes that there is room for improvement. Policy 5.16  sets a target of 95 per cent for recycling/ reuse of CE&D waste by 2020, and the  Mayor supports more beneficial and higher order uses of this inert waste, for  example, in conjunction with land reclamation or coastal defences. A combination  of on-site mobile facilities on construction sites, effective use of existing waste  processing sites and, where appropriate, safeguarded wharves, and the provision  of recycling facilities at aggregate extraction sites, should be capable of meeting  the anticipated future requirement within London to achieve a more beneficial re- use of this material.  POLICy 5.19 HAzARDOuS wASTE  Strategic  A The Mayor has prepared a Hazardous Waste Report for London, working   in partnership with the boroughs, the Environment Agency, industry and  neighbouring authorities to identify the capacity gap for dealing with  London’s hazardous waste and to provide and maintain direction on the  need for hazardous waste management capacity.  Planning Decisions B Development proposals that would result in the loss of existing sites   for the treatment and/or disposal of hazardous waste should not be  permitted unless compensatory hazardous waste site provision has  been secured in accordance with Policy 5.17H.  LDF preparation C LDFs should:  a make provision for hazardous waste treatment plants to achieve, at  regional level, the necessary waste management requirements  b as part of meeting waste apportionment identify suitable sites for  the storage, treatment and reprocessing of relevant or a range of  hazardous waste streams  c identify sites for the temporary storage, treatment and remediation  of contaminated soils and demolition waste during major  developments.  practicable.  LDF preparation C LDFs should require developers to produce site waste management   plans to arrange for the efficient handling of CE&D waste and materials.     218 T H E  LO N D O N  P L A N  m A R C H  2 0 1 6  5.89A The 2013 report on Hazardous Waste concluded that London needs to find  treatment capacity for at least 80,000 tonnes of hazardous waste currently  sent to landfill, mostly to landfills in the South East and East of England. The  Mayor, through the London Waste Planning Forum, will continue working with  neighbouring authorities, LWARB, the Environment Agency and London waste  planning authorities to monitor capacity of waste facilities (including landfills)  managing London’s hazardous waste and identify opportunities for new treatment  capacity in London.   5.89 In 2011 around 320,000 tonnes of hazardous waste was produced in London  – including 35 per cent from construction, excavation and demolition waste  (containing asbestos and contaminated soil), and 32 per cent from the Utilities  sector. Changes to the definition of hazardous waste has meant more types of  waste, in particular Waste Electronic and Electrical Equipment (WEEE) waste, is  deemed hazardous requiring separate collection and treatment from traditional  mixed waste management systems. The amount of such waste produced has  continued to grow in the short and medium term, and London, along with the UK  generally, will need more and better hazardous waste treatment facilities to cope  with this. Without sustained action there remains the risk of a major shortfall in our  capacity to treat and dispose of hazardous waste safely, in line with stringent EU  Directive rules. This could lead to storage problems, illegal disposal (including fly  tipping) and rising public concern about health and environmental impacts. There  is therefore a need to continue to identify hazardous waste capacity for London.  The main requirement is for sites for regional facilities to be identified. Boroughs  will need to work together and with neighbouring authorities to consider the  necessary regional/local facilities when planning for their hazardous waste, now a  requirement under the duty to co-operate.  Aggregates  POLICy 5.20 AggREgATES  Strategic  A The Mayor will work with all relevant partners to ensure an adequate   supply of aggregates to support construction in London. This will be  achieved by:  1 encouraging re-use and recycling of construction, demolition and  excavation waste within London  2 extraction of land-won aggregates within London 3 importing aggregates to London by sustainable transport modes.   B The Mayor will work with strategic partners to achieve targets of:  a 95 per cent recycling/re-use of construction, demolition and  excavation waste by 2020  b 80 per cent recycling of that waste as aggregates by 2020.    T H E  LO N D O N  P L A N  m A R C H  2 0 1 6  219  5.90 London needs a reliable supply of construction materials to support continued  growth. These include land-won sand and gravel, crushed rock, marine sand  and gravel, and recycled and alternative materials. Most aggregates used in the  capital come from outside London, including marine sand and gravel and land-won  aggregates, principally crushed rock from other regions. There are relatively small  resources of workable land-won sand and gravel in London.   5.91 The Mayor supports the Government’s objective of achieving an essential level  of supply in the most sustainable fashion, in order to ensure a good supply of  locally sourced land-won aggregates. For the 2008 London Plan, the London  Aggregates Working Party advised the Mayor that an annual output of 1.0 million  tons per annum (mtpa) of land-won sand and gravel, sub-regionally apportioned  50:50 between boroughs in east and west London, was more realistic than the 1.1  mtpa proposed in the 2003 guidelines. This was accepted by the Mayor to inform  London policy and was agreed by the Secretary of State.  C London should make provision for the maintenance of a landbank (i.e.  seven years’ supply) of at least 5 million tonnes of land won aggregates  throughout the plan period until 2031.  LDF preparation D LDFs should make provision for the maintenance of a landbank (i.e.   seven years’ supply) of at least 5 million tonnes of land won aggregates  throughout the plan period to 2031 by a landbank apportionment of:  a at least 1.75 million tonnes to LB Havering b at least 0.7 million tonnes to LB Redbridge c at least 1.75 million tonnes to LB Hillingdon d at least 0.7 million tonnes to LB Hounslow  E Mineral planning authorities in London should:  a identify and safeguard aggregate resources in LDFs b support the development of aggregate recycling facilities, subject   to local amenity conditions. F To reduce the environmental impact of aggregates, LDFs should;  a ensure that appropriate use is made of planning conditions dealing  with aftercare, restoration and re-use of minerals sites following  extraction  b safeguard wharves and/or railheads with existing or potential  capacity for aggregate distribution   c minimise the movement of aggregates by road and maximise the  movement of aggregates via the Blue Ribbon Network   d develop policies that support the protection and enhancement of  aggregates recycling facilities.     220 T H E  LO N D O N  P L A N  m A R C H  2 0 1 6  5.92 The previous Government’s land-won sand and gravel guidelines for London for  the period 2005-2020 proposed 1.1 mtpa195. Recent monitoring suggests that  this target remains very challenging for London, and the Mayor is not persuaded  that setting the target suggested in the 2009 guidelines would actually increase  production. Accordingly, and following discussions with boroughs and the industry  on reserve levels, plan allocations and deliverability, the Mayor supports a realistic  landbank figure (i.e. seven years supply) of at least 5 million tonnes of land-won  aggregates for London throughout the plan period, apportioned to boroughs as  set out in Policy 5.20D.  5.93 There remains some potential for extraction beyond the boroughs identified in  the London Aggregates Monitoring report196, including within the Lee Valley. Other  boroughs with aggregates resources should consider opportunities in line with the  policies in the plan. Adverse impacts on European biodiversity sites as a result of  aggregates activities should be avoided.  5.94 Aggregates are bulky materials and LDF policies should maximise their use and  re-use and minimise their movement, especially by road. Policy 5.3 on sustainable  design and construction will be important in helping to reduce the demand for  natural materials. The objective of proximity dictates the best and most local use  of materials that can be extracted in London. Boroughs should safeguard both  existing, planned and potential sites for all the uses and activities identified for  safeguarding in paragraph 143 of the NPPF. Sites for depots may be particularly  appropriate in preferred industrial locations and other employment areas. Existing  and future wharf capacity is essential, especially for transporting marine-dredged  aggregates, and should be protected in accordance with Policy 7.26.   5.94A The NPPF in paragraph 145 calls on mineral planning authorities to maintain  a steady and adequate supply of aggregates by preparing an annual Local  Aggregates Assessment (LAA). The four boroughs identified in Policy 5.20 will  prepare either their own or joint LAAs. The Mayor does not consider that it would  be proportionate or reasonable for the other 29 boroughs to produce their own  LAAs, but that production of a joint LAA would be appropriate.  195 National and Regional Guidelines for Aggregate Provision in England 2005-2020, DCLG June 2009 196 GLA Aggregates Working Party, London Aggregates Monitoring Report 2008, August 2009 http://  legacy.london.gov.uk/mayor/planning/lawp/docs/lawp_monitoring2008.pdf     T H E  LO N D O N  P L A N  m A R C H  2 0 1 6  221  Contaminated land and hazardous substances  5.95 In a city where space is increasingly at a premium, it is essential that wherever  practicable, brownfield sites – including those affected by contamination – should  be recycled into new uses. This also provides an opportunity to deal with any  threats to health and the environment posed by contamination. Any land that  is affected by contamination, whether or not identified under the regulations,  may require measures to prevent contamination being activated or spread when  building takes place.  5.95A Where potentially contaminating activities are proposed, development should  include appropriate measures to mitigate any potential harmful effects.  POLICy 5.21 CONTAmINATED LAND  Strategic  A The Mayor supports the remediation of contaminated sites and   will work with strategic partners to ensure that the development of  brownfield land does not result in significant harm to human health or  the environment, and to bring contaminated land to beneficial use.   Planning decisions  B Appropriate measures should be taken to ensure that development   on previously contaminated land does not activate or spread  contamination.  LDF preparation  C LDFs should encourage the remediation of contaminated sites and set   out policy to deal with contamination.   POLICy 5.22 HAzARDOuS SubSTANCES AND INSTALLATIONS  Strategic A The Mayor will work with all relevant partners to ensure that hazardous   substances, installations and materials are managed in ways that limit  risks to London’s people and environment. He will consider publishing  supplementary guidance to support the application of this policy.  Planning decisions  B When assessing developments near hazardous installations:  a site specific circumstances and proposed mitigation measures  should be taken into account when applying the Health and Safety  Executive’s Planning Advice Developments near Hazardous  Installations (PADHI)1 methodology   1 PADHI – HSE’s Planning Land Use Methodology Health and Safety Executive September 2009    222 T H E  LO N D O N  P L A N  m A R C H  2 0 1 6  b the risks should be balanced with the benefits of development and  should take account of existing patterns of development.   LDF preparation C In preparing LDFs, boroughs should:  a identify the locations of major hazards (including pipelines carrying  hazardous substances)   b consult and give due weight to advice from the Health and Safety  Executive to ensure that land use allocations take account of  proximity to major hazards  c consult utilities to ensure that the timing of decommissioning and  the implications for development are reflected in proposals  d ensure that land use allocations for hazardous installations take  account of the need to incentivise and fund decommissioning.  D Boroughs should periodically review consents granted under the  Planning (Hazardous Substances) Act 1990 to ensure they reflect  current conditions and the physical capacity of the site.  5.96 The EU Directive on the prevention of major accidents involving hazardous  substances requires land use policies to take prevention and minimisation of  consequences into account. Where appropriate, advice should be sought from  the Health and Safety Executive. Development decisions should take account of  CLG Circular 04/00 Planning Controls for Hazardous Substances and the guidance  in paragraph 109 of the NPPF (specifically the fourth bullet point). The Mayor will  consider producing supplementary guidance supporting the application of these  principles in the particular circumstances of London.  5.96A London boroughs are hazardous substances authorities for the purposes of the  Planning (Hazardous Substances) Act 1990 and associated regulations. Under  these provisions they grant consents for hazardous installations, specifying  the nature and quantity of hazardous substances that can be kept at each. It is  important that these consents are kept under review to ensure that changes that  could affect the location of development around installations (such as utilities’  plans to decommission gas holders) are taken into account. The Mayor will provide  further guidance on this issue.
