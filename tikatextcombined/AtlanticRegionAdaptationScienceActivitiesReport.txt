This places dykelands, coastal populations and their infrastructure and  industries at risk. Trends in hydrologic data are already beginning to appear in New Brunswick  hydrometric records to support the predictions of local climate scenarios developed using  statistical downscaling from global models. Ice on lakes, rivers and along the coast is forming  later, mid-winter break ups are occurring more often and the dates of spring floods have  advanced to earlier in the year. Saltwater intrusion into freshwater aquifers is a growing concern  as coastal municipalities and industries work to achieve a balance between changing demands  and availability. Impacts to municipal water supplies, agriculture, forestry, fisheries, tourism and  energy are also expected as water resources come under increased pressure. The predicted  regional impacts of climate change assembled from the general scientific literature and the work  presented at jurisdictional expert conferences and workshops held in New Brunswick are  summarized. Recognizing the importance and benefits of working collaboratively on regional  adaptation issues, the Atlantic Provinces have adopted a Climate Change Adaptation Strategy.  Within the framework of this Atlantic Adaptation Strategy, and as part of the Natural Resources  Canada Regional Adaptation Collaboration Program, a number of projects, informed by science,  are being proposed by the Atlantic Provinces. These projects are intended to develop tools and  approaches that will support appropriate adaptation planning and decision making for coastal  areas, inland waterways and for related infrastructure.    Keywords: adaptation, climate change, infrastructure, statistical downscaling, Atlantic Canada,  sea-level rise, flooding, regional collaboration       1. Introduction    The scientific consensus is that climate change due to human activities is occurring now, and  will become more pronounced in the future. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  (IPCC Working Group I, 2007) have deemed the evidence of climate change as “unequivocal”  as we observe increasing global air and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow and  ice and rising sea level. Computer models, used to simulate the changes to the global climate  induced by human activities, predict that the climate will become warmer, as global average  surface temperatures are predicted to rise between 1.1°C and 6.4 °C over the next hundred  years (IPCC Working Group I, 2007). Such changes in the earth’s temperature are  unprecedented in the last 10,000 years.     Efforts to decrease greenhouse gas emissions are required, but these efforts will not stop  further climate change from occurring. Climate changes have already begun and will continue  throughout the 21st century, thereby affecting our natural environment and resources  significantly.  What may appear to be relatively small changes in temperature are linked to  substantial changes in the physical environment. Changes in weather and climate have  numerous ancillary effects on other vital aspects of the total environment such as the water  cycle, vegetation, pests, diseases, fire risk, floods and droughts, food production, and human  health. Therefore, changes induced by climatic change will have a significant effect on the  health and economic well-being of all Atlantic Canadians. Adaptation to changing environmental  conditions is necessary to lessen the effects of climate change.       2     In the Atlantic region, unlike other parts of Canada, the predicted effects of climate change,  such as sea-level rise and the increased occurrence and intensity of extreme weather events,  are compounded in many coastal areas by post-glacial crustal subsidence. This will increase  coastal erosion and flooding, placing dykelands, coastal populations and their infrastructure and  industries at risk.    Scientific work (including monitoring, research, special investigations, and a review of scientific  literature) provides an understanding of the many risks posed by climate change, which natural  and human systems are likely to be most vulnerable, and what might be achieved by adaptive  responses. This scientific work, commonly referred to as adaptation science, is required in the  immediate future to provide a sound basis for policy, planning, and program delivery aimed at  offsetting the impacts of climate change.      This report focuses on adaptation science activities previously conducted in Atlantic Canada  (the provinces of New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, and Prince  Edward Island) and identifies areas in need of future research to identify the consequences of  climate change and potential adaptation responses. The following section summarizes climate  projections to the end of this century for Atlantic Canada, and more specifically New Brunswick,  based on the results of statistical downscaling of global climate models. The subsequent section  provides an overview of the changes already being observed in Atlantic Canada based on the  examination of historical climate records. This is followed by a summary of the predicted  regional impacts of climate change assembled from the general scientific literature and the work  presented at jurisdictional expert conferences and workshops. The last two sections of the  report present an overview of the Atlantic Canada Climate Change Adaptation Strategy and the  project areas being addressed as part of the Natural Resources Canada Regional Adaptation  Collaboration Program.        2. Climate Projections for Atlantic Canada    Although future climates cannot be predicted with certainty, confidence in many aspects of  climatic prediction is growing as global climate models become more advanced.     At present, the prediction of future climates is largely based on coarsely gridded global climate  models that are being developed by researchers around the world for various greenhouse gas  emissions scenarios (IPCC Working Group I, 2007). In order for these models to be of use at a  regional and local scale, statistical downscaling techniques based on historical climate  observations are commonly used. This method enables more detailed local-scale predictions to  be elaborated on from relatively coarse global climate models outputs [i.e., the reliability of  predictions improve as “predictions” of past climate improve].    Swansburg et al. (2004) and Lines et al. (2006) developed statistical downscaling model outputs  of the first version of the Canadian Global Climate Model (CGCM1) in order to generate local  climatic scenarios for New Brunswick and the Atlantic region respectively.  While their work was  based on the first generation of climate change scenarios, these efforts have been major  contributions to climate change prediction in Atlantic Canada and have provided some of the  most detailed predictions of future climatic conditions for the region to date.        3   Local climate scenarios for New Brunswick  Swansburg et al. (2004) generated local hydro-climatic scenarios for seven meteorological  stations in New Brunswick for the period of 2010 to 2099. Using the CGCM1 with, what was  hoped to be a worst-case scenario of tripling of carbon dioxide concentrations over pre- industrial levels by 2100, They predicted that annual and seasonal maximum and minimum air  temperature would increase significantly across New Brunswick throughout the 2020’s, 2050’s  and 2080’s compared to conditions during the period 1961 to 1990. They estimated that the  annual minimum air temperature would increase by approximately 4 to 5°C, while maximum air  temperature would increase by approximately 4°C, with larger increases in air temperature at  central New Brunswick stations than in northern or southern regions of the Province.  Seasonally, increases up to 6°C were estimated in maximum spring air temperature and  minimum winter air temperature.      They predicted that, compared to current climate conditions, total annual precipitation would  increase from 2010 to 2099 by 25 to 50% by the 2080’s at northern and central stations and by  9 to 14% at southern stations.  Throughout most of the province, winter precipitation would  increase, and, given the warmer temperatures, some of this increase may be in the form of rain  rather than snow.     In addition to temperature and precipitation, they performed downscaling of New Brunswick  hydrometric records.  Using this approach, they projected that average annual discharge would  increase by 16 to 45% in New Brunswick by the 2080’s compared to average discharge  conditions from 1961 to 1990.  Winter and spring discharge will increase significantly at all  hydrometric stations, with the largest increases likely towards the end of the 21st century.   Summer discharge will decrease significantly at all stations, while autumn discharge was  predicted to decrease significantly in all rivers except the upper Saint John and Restigouche.   An increase in flood magnitude and frequency was predicted for New Brunswick (Swansburg et  al., 2004).    Local climate scenarios for the Atlantic region  Statistical downscaling was used by Lines et al. (2006) to generate local climatic scenarios for  14 meteorological stations located across all four Atlantic Provinces. Using the CGCM1, with a  less extreme emissions scenario (GHG+A1) than that used by Swansburg et al. (2004), they  also developed seasonal and annual projections for the 2020’s, 2050’s and 2080’s. Their  projections indicated a consistent rise in maximum and minimum air temperatures across the  region, with the exception of Labrador, where temperatures were predicted to decrease slightly.  They estimated that in Atlantic Canada the mean annual minimum air temperature would  increase by 5°C, while the mean annual maximum air temperature would increase by  approximately 4°C.     They projected that by the 2080’s, winters will become 4 to 6 % wetter and summers will  become 8 to 18 % wetter than the base climate of 1961 to 1990.    Average annual precipitation was projected to rise by 8 to 20% in Atlantic Canada, except over  northern Nova Scotia and eastern New Brunswick, where decreases of approximately 5% were  projected (Lines et al., 2006).     Recent work  As part of the recent Canada-wide study, From Impacts to Adaptation: Canada in a Changing  Climate 2007, a summary of climate projections based on a suite of seven global climate  models was presented in the chapter on Atlantic Canada by Vasseur and Catto (2008). Largely      4   due to the work of the Canadian Climate Change Scenarios Network (CCCSN), the outputs of  various global climate models developed by researchers around the world are now accessible  on-line for use in the development of climate change scenarios for impacts studies of user  specified sites (Barrow et al., 2004). The work presented by Vasseur and Catto (2008)  illustrates a recent shift towards looking at suites of several climate models rather than focusing  on more detailed downscaled projections from just one model (e.g. Swansburg et al., 2004;  Lines et al., 2006).     By examining the projections for the 2080’s from a suite of global climate models, Vasseur and  Catto (2008) were able to project a change in the average annual temperature of approximately  4°C and an increase in annual precipitation of approximately 7 to 8% above 1961 to 1990 levels  for Atlantic Canada.  Seasonally, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island are  predicted to experience an increase in mean annual temperature of 2 to 4°C in summer and 1.5  to 6°C in winter during the next 50 years compared to observed conditions from 1961 to 1990  (Vasseur and Catto, 2007). Newfoundland and Labrador are also predicted to experience  smaller increases than in the other Atlantic Provinces due to the influence of the Labrador  Current and the North American Oscillation on climate patterns (Vasseur and Catto, 2007).        3. Observed Impacts of Climatic Changes in Atlantic Canada    At present, we know temperatures have increased over the past century by an average of 1.3°C  across Canada (Environment Canada, 2009), extreme precipitation events have become more  frequent, and the ice regime on lakes and rivers has changed and will likely continue to change.      Trends are beginning to appear in hydrometric records that support the predictions of local  climate scenarios developed using statistical downscaling. Flooding and ice jamming of inland  waterways, and sea level rise and storm surges along coastlines, are two key areas where  impacts are occurring in Atlantic Canada and where the observed trends are consistent with  climate change.     Inland Waters   Climatic change was given serious consideration following the major 1987 ice jam floods along  the Saint John River (Beltaos, 1999; Hare et al., 1997). Although no overall trends in mean  annual precipitation or stream flow were detected at the time, both appeared to have become  more variable since 1950. Freshets had generally started earlier since 1972. There were also  several years with high flow, when compared with periods earlier in the century. Only a small  rise of spring temperatures was detectable, but snowy or wet winters, coupled with greater  variability in temperature, caused earlier thaws and several major flooding and ice-jam events.      Hare et al. (1997) stated that one-day heavy rain or snowfall events had increased in intensity  over the Saint John River Basin since 1872.  Major precipitation events, not always associated  with tropical disturbances crossing the region, occasionally occurred in late summer and fall.  A  further conclusion was that large amounts of precipitation might also occur during the period of  spring ice breakup and flooding in New Brunswick, dramatically exacerbating the resulting flood  (Hare et al., 1997), as demonstrated by the flooding of the Saint John River Basin in the spring  of 2008.     In 2008, R.V. Anderson Associates Limited examined the records of 13 hydrometric stations in  New Brunswick over the period of 1969 to 2006 to ascertain if significant trends in selected  hydrologic parameters attributable to climate change could be detected. They found that trends      5   in hydrologic data are beginning to appear in the hydrometric records, with the most significant  changes occurring during the past few decades; climate change was surmised to be a plausible  explanation for this observation. Statistical analyses confirmed previous observations that the  dates of spring flooding had advanced to earlier in the year. Trends in the data also indicated  that the number of mid-winter ice breakup events had increased over the period of record, and  that ice regimes in New Brunswick are less stable, leading to more uncertainty about ice  jamming conditions.     From an engineering perspective, an increased frequency and severity of river ice movement  and jamming could increase the possibility of infrastructure being damaged or destroyed by the  erosive power of the ice (Beltaos and Burrell, 2003). The apparent increasing instability of ice  regimes in New Brunswick, combined with the potential for major storms to occur  simultaneously with the spring thaw and the onset of the freshet, confirms a need for adaptation  along inland waters to lessen the likelihood and severity of future flood damages.     Further work should be undertaken to compare the hydrometric records in the other Atlantic  Provinces to see if similar trends are also occurring there.    Coastal Areas  As detailed in Vasseur and Catto (2008) and Daigle et al. (2006), storm surges have resulted in  property destruction and erosion along coastal areas in all four Atlantic Provinces in the past 15  years. The most notable of these was the benchmark Atlantic storm event of January 21, 2000,  declared a disaster by the Federal Government of Canada.      Atlantic Canada (with the exception of northern Labrador) is undergoing isostatic subsidence  and tilting as a result of glacial loading and unloading at the end of the last glaciation (Daigle et  al., 2006). The observed rate of relative sea-level rise is therefore a result of the combined  effects of global sea-level rise and subsidence, and is greater for Atlantic Canada than the  current global rate of 17 cm per century (Daigle et al., 2006).     Based on current estimates, a relative sea-level rise on the order of 60 cm is expected for  Atlantic Canada over the coming century (Daigle et al., 2006; IPCC, 2007). This will result in  more frequent flooding of low-lying areas, currently prone to flooding, but also in flooding of  higher, previously immune areas that currently host critical infrastructure (Daigle et al., 2006;  Vasseur and Catto, 2008).    Currently, a water level in excess of 3.6 m above Chart Datum (CD), similar to the January 21,  2000 event, occurs approximately once every 100 years in the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence  (Daigle et al., 2006). Based on climatic predictions, researchers surmise that the frequency and  severity of these events will increase with global warming and the associated sea level rise.  At  the present rate of relative sea level rise, Daigle et al. (2006) predict that by 2100 a storm- induced water level of 3.6 m above CD could statistically occur every 10 years in the Southern  Gulf of St. Lawrence.    Sea level rise threatens not only coastal infrastructure, but also fragile ecosystems and natural  resources such as wetlands and freshwater aquifers. Saltwater intrusion of freshwater aquifers  is a growing concern as municipalities and industries work to achieve a balance between  changing demands and water availability in coastal areas. The impact of sea level rise and a  changing hydrology regime on the saltwater/freshwater interface in coastal areas is poorly  understood at this time and is an area in need of future research.          6     4. Summary of Expert Meetings on Climate Change     Since 2003 New Brunswick has hosted a number of meetings and workshops attended by  jurisdictional experts from New Brunswick and other Atlantic Provinces dealing with climate  change adaptation.  These meetings and workshops have increased our understanding of the  anticipated impacts of climate change in the region and have helped to identify regional  adaptation priorities.     In November 2003, a two-day meeting was held in Fredericton to discuss adaptation to climatic  change as it applies to New Brunswick water resources. Attended by more than 30 water  resource managers, environmental specialists and experts on climate change, the meeting  concluded that New Brunswick (and also Atlantic Canada) faces many challenges to adapt to  climate change. This meeting began the process of quantifying the possible impacts of the  changing climate on the region.     The principal recommendations from this meeting (Riley Environment Limited, 2004) follow:   • Continue monitoring river, groundwater, and climate-related parameters;  • Development of an accurate inventory of water resources (including supply and usage)   to enable effective management;  • Development of provincial water use policies and resource management programs that   recognize the value of water;   • Development, as a high priority, of an adaptation strategy, to enable the province to plan   for the inevitable and substantial impacts expected from climate change;  • Revision of infrastructure design criteria to reflect changes in climate;  • Coordination of efforts of various federal and provincial government agencies;   • Public education on the expected effects of climate change on water resources; and  • Encouraging better use and conservation of water resources.     A further technical meeting of experts in the areas of water and natural resource management,  fisheries, climatology, civil engineering and ecology took place at the Université de Moncton,  New Brunswick in 2004. The title of the event was: “Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation:  Water Resources and Fisheries in New Brunswick”.     The scientists at this meeting reconfirmed the conclusions and recommendations made at the  November 2003 conference. Presentations on science and policy, in particular the reality of  having to “plan for uncertainty”, made it clear that decisions have to be made now, bearing in  mind what we already know. This was summed up as: “It’s happening, what are we going to do  about it?” Integrated planning, taking a whole ecosystem approach, and making decisions on a  basis of sound science, were all emphasized.   Based on the information assembled by drawing on the general scientific literature, and the  work presented at the New Brunswick expert conferences and workshops held from 2003 to  2008, the sectors predicted to be most affected by climate change in Atlantic Canada are:  precipitation and water resources, ecosystems and biodiversity, fisheries and aquaculture,  coastal zones, agriculture and horticulture, forestry, air quality, health, and sustainable  development. Tables detailing the predicted effects of climatic change in each of these sectors,  along with an indication of the relative degree of confidence, are given in Appendix I. Major  areas that were not explicitly dealt with included energy production, transportation,  manufacturing, and the retail and service industries (including insurance).       7     During the development of the chapter on Atlantic Canada (Vasseur and Catto, 2008) for the  Natural Resources Canada report, From Impacts to Adaptation: Canada in a Changing Climate  2007, coastal areas, inland waters and related infrastructure were identified as priority areas for  adaptation to climate change in Atlantic Canada. In May 2008 the New Brunswick Department  of Environment in collaboration with the three other Atlantic Provinces and in partnership with  Natural Resources Canada hosted a Climate Change Adaptation Workshop in Saint John, New  Brunswick. The workshop was attended by climate change and adaptation scientists and  researchers from the four Atlantic Provinces and all levels of government. The presentations  and discussions focused on three priority areas, summarized below.      Sea-level rise is expected to increase coastal flooding, storm surge effects, erosion and  other coastal hazards, thus threatening vital infrastructure, settlements and facilities that  support the livelihood of our coastal communities. Impacts in the coastal zone are expected  to affect local resources, for example through erosion of beaches and salt water intrusion of  drinking water wells.   Coastal Areas     Inland Waters  Later arrival of freeze-up and more mid-winter break-ups of river ice will occur. Spring break- up has advanced to earlier in the year and the number of ice-free days has increased.  Inland water resource impacts include fluctuating groundwater recharge and lower summer  groundwater levels, plus surface and groundwater quantity and quality changes. Water  availability is an example of a critical component which will be impacted by climate change.   It is predicted that the Atlantic region will receive more total precipitation; however it is  expected to arrive in the form of more intense storm events. The ability to adapt to flood and  drought conditions must be developed.    Infrastructure  Infrastructure-based components of our economies and social networks (transportation,  wellness and culture, public services) will be altered by changes to climate. Our  understanding of how predicted changes to our climate will affect these infrastructure  resources, and therefore, our economy is a critical part of planning our future.         5. Atlantic Climate Change Adaptation Strategy    Coming out of the 2008 workshop, the Council of Atlantic Environment Ministers (CAEM)  identified climate change, and especially climate change adaptation, as a key environmental  issue for Atlantic Canada. Recognizing the importance and benefits of working collaboratively  on regional adaptation issues, and based on the recommendations from previous expert  meetings on climate change, the CAEM agreed to collaborate on a Climate Change Adaptation  Strategy for Atlantic Canada in June 2008.     Principles and Goals   1. To enhance the resilience and adaptive capacity of Atlantic Canada communities to climate   change.  2. To integrate climate change adaptation measures through climate proofing in existing and   development activities.  3. To promote meaningful regional collaboration, co-ordination and sharing of good practices   on the integration of climate change adaptation in development decisions.      8     Key Result Areas   Recognizing the complex inter-relationships and linkages among the principles and goals of the  strategy, three key result areas for action were identified under the Atlantic Climate Change  Adaptation Strategy.      1 - Indentifying Climate Risks  An important first step in adaptation to climate change is the identification and quantification  of the risks associated with climate change. Once quantified, it is then possible to begin to  build tools to ensure the resilience of both natural and man-made environments to these  risks.      2 - Climate Proofing Decisions  Climate proofing decisions in Atlantic Canada refers to assisting partners in their efforts to  reduce their risks and vulnerability to climate change.  Seeking opportunities from climate  variability where they exist is also a component of climate proofing decisions.       3 - Regional Collaboration   Establishing a Regional Adaptation Collaborative with an organizational body to oversee its  implementation, and focusing on the common priority Atlantic region issues of: coastal  areas, inland waters and infrastructure.        6. Atlantic Regional Adaptation Collaborative Program    In June, 2008 all four Atlantic Ministers of the Environment formally agreed to work  collaboratively on adaptation to climate change. The provinces have assembled a team of  professionals, scientists and partners in engineering, land use planning and municipal  administration interested in helping communities incorporate adaptation in decision making.  Within the framework of the Atlantic Adaptation Strategy, and as part of the Natural Resources  Canada Regional Adaptation Collaborative Program (RAC), this collaborative will aid  in building  on the existing and well functioning networks that exist in the Atlantic region, as well as identify  opportunities, fill gaps and remove barriers to adaptation. As part of the RAC, a number of  projects have been proposed that would develop tools and approaches to enable appropriate  adaptation planning and decision making in the three previously identified priority areas of  inland waterways, coastal areas and their related infrastructures.         As proposed, the Atlantic RAC will extend collaboration beyond the four Atlantic Departments of  Environment to include the Atlantic Planners Institute, the four Atlantic Engineering  Associations, the Atlantic Municipal Associations, the Insurance Bureau of Canada and Natural  Resources Canada. The aim of the Atlantic RAC is to foster collaborative work which will  produce applied solutions to existing problems that relate to environmental change.    The New Brunswick Department of the Environment is the lead agency for climate change  adaptation in New Brunswick and has taken on the lead role in the development of the Atlantic  RAC. In this capacity the Department has been leading the development of an Atlantic Canada  proposal to the Natural Resources Canada Regional Adaptation Collaborative Program.           9   7. Conclusions     Uncertainties exist about the magnitude and consequences of climatic change, especially at the  local scale. However, Atlantic Canada is being, and will continue to be impacted by a changing  climate. Coastal communities and habitats, inland water resources in terms of quality and  quantity issues, and infrastructure such as transportation and communications networks and  water and wastewater infrastructure will be increasingly stressed by climate change impacts.     Approaches to risk and vulnerability management must be developed to protect current and  future development, communities, our economy and critical natural features from impacts  associated with climate change. Development should be based on principles that consider  weather extremes, environmental conditions, and matters of public safety.  Decision making at  all levels of government and support mechanisms to those processes (e.g. regulation and  policy) should seek to guide development to appropriate locations that reduce or remove public  risk and increase their resilience to a changing climate.       8.

This information has been assembled by drawing on the general scientific  literature, and takes into account the work presented at the expert conferences held in New  Brunswick from 2003 to 2008. The level of confidence varies considerably between predictions,  so where possible, an indication is given of the degree of confidence for each item. This  involves professional judgment but is still useful when interpreting the information.     The categories “high”, “medium” and “low” can be equated with “very likely”, “likely” and  “possible” probabilities of occurrence.       Table 1. Predicted effects and implications of climatic change on weather and climate in   Atlantic Canada (degree of confidence: H = highest, M = intermediate, L = least).

This is  especially true for New Brunswick where  competing continental and marine influences  complicate predictions.          12   Table 2. Predicted effects and implications of climatic change on precipitation and water  resources in Atlantic Canada (degree of confidence: H = highest, M = intermediate, L  = least).     PRECIPITATION AND WATER RESOURCES   Predicted Effects  Implications   The precipitation distribution through the  year will change. Water supply will  diminish, especially in inland districts, due  to higher temperatures. M-H    Assess groundwater and surface water  reserves in terms of sustainable yields.   Promote water conservation in all use sectors,  especially industry and agriculture.    Hydrological processes / water cycle will  change. H    Ensure adequate data collection and evaluation  on all components of the hydrologic cycle,  including evaporation and infiltration.    The duration of dry spells between rainfall  events is expected to increase, with an  associated increase in drought frequency,  duration, and severity. M-H    Carry out studies that may lead to better  techniques for prediction of atmospheric or  hydrologic drought.    Precipitation patterns will become more  erratic, with an increased frequency of  intense storm events, such as summer  convective storms (thunderstorms,  hailstorms and tornadoes). Associated  impacts from erosion and siltation.  M-H    Ensure appropriate agencies maintain  adequate forecasting capability and emergency  preparedness.    River flows will become more variable.  Spring peak flows will occur earlier and be  reduced in duration. Summer minimum  flows will be lower. Periods of very low or  zero flow are expected to become more  frequent. H    Carry out updated hydrological modelling for  NB, to examine the details of the altered  hydrological regime.    Flooding may become more frequent and  more severe.  Mid-winter thaws and ice  breakups, with the potential for ice-jam  flooding, will become more widespread  and frequent, resulting in more ice jam  floods during the winter months.  If the  mid-winter jams re-consolidate, then  spring ice breakup is likely to have more  severe impacts. M-H    Using an updated hydrological analysis,  produce updated flood hazard mapping for the  province to assess critical areas at risk.   Note: existing hydrologic relationships based  largely upon the assumption of a homogeneous  period of record may underestimate peak flows  used for bridge and culvert design. A safety  factor may have to be added during design to  take into account the hydrologic uncertainties  caused by climatic change.    Aquatic ecosystems will change as water  levels become lower and water  temperatures become higher during the  summer months. Algal blooms and  eutrophication expected to increase. M-H    Ensure continued monitoring; identify critical  habitats; continuously evaluate effectiveness of  nutrient management activities.          13   Table 3. Predicted effects and implications of climatic change on ecosystems and biodiversity  in Atlantic Canada (degree of confidence: H = highest, M = intermediate, L = least).     ECOSYSTEMS AND BIODIVERSITY   Predicted Effects  Implications   Altered ecosystem characteristics and  productivity.  Some species and  ecosystems may be reduced or disappear  altogether, causing a loss of biodiversity.  H    Critical species and habitats need to be  identified and plans put in place for protection.    Cold-water species such as salmonids will  become increasingly stressed as water  levels become lower and water  temperatures become higher during the  summer months. Suitable freshwater  habitat for some aquatic species, such as  salmonids, may be lost.  Increased water  temperatures and reduced dissolved  oxygen is expected to harm cold water fish  species. M-H    Ensure continued monitoring; identify critical  habitats.    Shrinkage of boreal/alpine zones with  reduction in associated habitat, threats to  survival of associated biota. H       Invasion of new (”exotic”) plants and  animals extending their ranges into NB. H    Plan for appropriate surveillance and  management.    Increased fire hazard expected to threaten  key habitats and associated species. M-H    Examine options for enhanced protection of  critical habitats.    Low river flows in summer and increased  water temperatures will threaten cold  water aquatic life. H    Consider greater management efforts on  species that can better tolerate warmer water.    Increased frequency of extreme weather  events (especially windstorms, droughts,  and increased winter freeze-thaw activity)  expected to pose significantly increased  stress on forest and other ecosystems.  M- H    Examine options for enhanced protection of  critical habitats (also, see under forests).           14   Table 4. Predicted effects and implications of climatic change on coastal zones in Atlantic  Canada (degree of confidence: H = highest, M = intermediate, L = least).      COASTAL ZONES  Predicted Effects  Implications   Mean sea level will continue to rise,  increasing the likelihood of (a) coastal  flooding, (b) drainage problems with  urban infrastructure draining to tidal  estuaries. H    Ensure coastal development proceeds taking  into consideration projected environmental  changes.    Increased rates of coastal flooding and  erosion due to more extreme weather  events, higher water levels (including  storm surges), and less protection against  waves being provided by sea ice.  Associated effects on coastal  infrastructure. M-H    Consider planning for managed retreat or  engineered protection of critical areas prone to  erosion.    Sea-level rise and changes in  precipitation could alter coastal marshes  and cause detrimental changes to coastal  ecosystems. M    Evaluate coastal areas of potential risk based  on projected sea level rise, topographical  information (e.g., existing mapping), and  ecological assessments.    Increased risk of salt intrusion and  contamination of coastal aquifers, due to  increasing sea levels and increased  pumping from inland aquifers for  irrigation. H    Evaluate sustainability of coastal drinking water  aquifers and plan for future new supplies as  required.             15   Table 5. Predicted effects and implications of climatic change on fisheries and aquaculture in  Atlantic Canada (degree of confidence: H = highest, M = intermediate, L = least).      FISHERIES AND AQUACULTURE  Predicted Effects  Implications   Inland aquaculture may suffer from  reduced water quantity and quality due to  lower summer flows, reduced water  availability and higher water  temperatures. M-H    Evaluate water resource availability using  updated hydrological analyses.   Develop a strategy for reducing water use in  aquaculture.    Increased pest and disease problems,  affecting inland and coastal fisheries  (including shellfish). M    Plan and operate operations to minimise  potential effects of new or increased  pests/diseases.  Improve fish/shellfish health monitoring  programs.   Recreational angling likely to be affected  by low summer river flows, changes in  the ice season and changes in species  abundance. Fishing seasons may  change (timing, duration).  M-H    Plan additional protection measures as required  to maximise the potential for the survival of  desired species.   Develop alternative recreation and tourism  strategies (e.g. to account for reduction of  recreational fishery).    Salmonids increasingly vulnerable due to  higher water temperatures and lower  summer flows. M-H    Identify critical salmonid habitat for protection,  emphasizing stream vegetation buffers and  protection of water resources.            16   Table 6. Predicted effects and implications of climatic change on forestry in Atlantic Canada  (degree of confidence: H = highest, M = intermediate, L = least).      FORESTRY  Predicted Effects Implications   Increased fire hazard. H  Promote appropriate forest fire risk prevention   and mitigation measures.   Increased risk of wind damage. M-L  Strategic planning to anticipate and mitigate   effects of wind damage.   Increased risk of destructive pests and  diseases. M-H    Ongoing monitoring and scientific studies of  destructive pests and diseases.     Development of forest management practices  to lessen or adapt to higher pest damages.    Longer growing season and higher CO2  may stimulate growth, but limited overall  benefit due to poor soils and increased  drought stress. H    Ongoing trials required of species or varieties  with potentially improved adaptation to  drought, higher temperatures, or higher CO2.    Changes in regeneration, reproduction,  and fitness for some species, and a  potentially changing species mix. M-H    Ongoing scientific studies required to assess  the probable impact of changing atmospheric  conditions on regeneration, growth,  reproduction, and survival.    Increased incidence of freeze-thaw winter  injury. M    Ongoing scientific studies required to assess  the probable impact of freeze-thaw winter  injury on tree survival and associated forest  decline.            17   Table 7. Predicted effects and implications of climatic change on agriculture and horticulture  in Atlantic Canada (degree of confidence: H = highest, M = intermediate, L = least).     AGRICULTURE AND HORTICULTURE   Predicted Effects  Implications   Probability of summer water shortages  will increase, creating a greater need for  irrigation in New Brunswick’s potato belt  and possibly in other areas. H    Evaluate groundwater resources in agricultural  areas and the potential impacts of long-term  irrigation.    Increased irrigation may be problematic in  some areas due to local water chemistry.    Plan for additional water testing for irrigation  suitability (e.g. sodium absorption ratio testing).    More summer rainfall is expected to fall in  high intensity rainfall events. This means  an increased probability of soil erosion. H    Promote conservation practices in agriculture,  forestry and horticulture that protect against soil  erosion.    Longer frost-free season and higher  mean temperatures (most likely in inland  districts, less certain in coastal areas)  may allow new crops to be grown or  increased productivity of some existing  crops. M-L    Evaluate options for trial or introductions of new  crop species or varieties.    Potential for increases in pests and  diseases, including novel or exotic  varieties. M-H    Planning required to anticipate and mitigate the  impacts of new pests, diseases.    Increased heat stress for livestock,  especially in intensive operations. M    Anticipate and mitigate the impacts of higher  heat stress.          18   Table 8. Predicted effects and implications of climatic change on air quality in Atlantic Canada  (degree of confidence: H = highest, M = intermediate, L = least).     AIR QUALITY   Predicted Effects Implications   Hotter summers are expected, with an  increased frequency of smog episodes. H    Maintain focus on NOx and VOC controls, plus  public advisories of poor air quality episodes.    Increasing temperatures will lead to an  increased flux of VOCs in to the  atmosphere from natural and other  sources (approx 20% increase per degree  Celsius). H    Maintain priority on effective VOC controls  (industries and transportation) and promote  cleaner energy sources.    Changes may occur in atmospheric  circulation that influence the long-range  transport of air pollutants. M-L    Maintain monitoring programs to detect and  understand changes.    The emission of air pollutants associated  with electrical generation may change as  heating and cooling demands change  (increased demand in summer, lessening  demand in winter). M-H    Additional potential for exacerbation of  summertime smog episodes: maintain  monitoring and assessment networks, promote  energy smart buildings to offset increased  summer demands.    Forest fires expected to be more frequent  and larger, increasing the associated  emissions of VOCs and particulate  matter. M-H    Maintain air quality tracking and advisory  programs; need for health studies to  understand the significance of additional risks  and their effects.   Changes in the nature of pollen, dust and  spore concentrations are expected in  response to warmer weather, possibly  synergised by higher CO2 and humidity.  M    Maintain monitoring of key indicators to track  and understand the nature of changes, and  provide input to health management.            19   Table 9. Predicted effects and implications of climatic change on human health in Atlantic  Canada (degree of confidence: H = highest, M = intermediate, L = least).     HUMAN HEALTH   Predicted Effects  Implications   Increase in conditions relating to heat  stress, possible exacerbation of air  pollution related stresses. M-H    Provide adequate advisories and mitigation.    Increase in probability of bacteriological  contamination of food and water. M    Increased need for surveillance and inspection  programs.    Increase of vector-borne diseases. M  Increased surveillance and testing of swimming  areas and wildlife vectors.    Possible decrease in cold-related  conditions, frostbite, hypothermia  (complicated by changes in activities and  behaviour). M-L    Uncertain; anticipate shifts in recreational  activity patterns.            20   Table 10. Predicted effects and implications of climatic change on sustainable development in  Atlantic Canada (degree of confidence: H = highest, M = intermediate, L = least).      SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT  Predicted Impacts  Implications   Changes in climatic conditions (such as  rainfall intensity, duration and frequency)  might make some land (e.g. flood plains,  steep sites) unsuitable for some types of  development, and might require changes in  development patterns and the types of  development. M-H    Carry out the studies necessary to identify and  evaluate potential hazards.   Use community planning and landscape design  tools to lessen the exposure and susceptibility of  future development to potential natural hazards  created or enhanced by climatic change.   Promote land stewardship for critical areas and  areas subject to erosion.     Place special attention in terms of land use  planning on appropriate development in areas  prone to riverine or river ice flooding.    Drinking water quality will likely be affected  by the change in the quantity and quality of  water at the source, as well as from the  problems of old water infrastructure. H    Examine the adequacy of drinking water supplies  and supply systems in terms of quantity and  quality.   Review source water protection programs for  effectiveness.    Urban drainage infrastructure will be  overloaded more often.  Associated risk of  contamination from sewage. M    Review basic municipal drainage infrastructure.    Assess the risk of urban flooding, and associated  water contamination, due to urban drainage  infrastructure becoming over-loaded more often.     Promote design of urban development that  minimizes runoff and maximizes natural  infiltration so as to replenish aquifers.    Due to changing climatic conditions,  municipal or coastal infrastructure designed  to have long life spans might be damaged or  become incapable of functioning properly M    Assess existing infrastructure with remaining  long service lives and renovate/ repair if  necessary.   Design new infrastructure considering potential  hydroclimatic changes. Develop and promote  design criteria to minimize susceptibility of future.     Priority should be given be given to areas such  as major municipal or coastal infrastructure or  other areas where the planning horizons are long  and structures are designed to have long life  spans.    Increased temperatures may change  requirements for heating and air  conditioning. M    Promote site layouts and building materials,  designs and technologies that lessen indoor  extremes of temperature.    Resource availability might change as  commodity supplies and markets respond to  changing environmental conditions. L    Carry out basic studies of the energy and  material (resource) inputs and outputs to define  the economic footprints of the province’s urban  areas, and develop appropriate conservation  measures as needed.
