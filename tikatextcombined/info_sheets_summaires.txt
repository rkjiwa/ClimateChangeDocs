The information is based on a series of presentations developed by the Ecology Action Centre  which are available on line from www.ecologyaction.ca/content/coastal    Nova Scotia’s Coasts  Nova Scotia has a rich variety of coastal ecosystems: beaches and dune systems, rocky shores, tidal marshes  and estuaries. For more information on Nova Scotia’s coastal ecosystems refer to Nova Scotia State of the  Coast Report. Coastal wetlands in particular, are areas of high productivity, biodiversity and sensitivity. GPI  Atlantic estimates wetlands provide $7.9 billion worth of ecosystem services to Nova Scotia annually, and that  salt marshes alone provide over $400 million worth of ecosystem services to Nova Scotia communities each  year including flood and erosion control and infrastructure protection from storm surges.    Coastal Change   Shorelines are dynamic and always changing; constantly being eroded and built up again (see diagram below  for an illustration of shoreline processes). Living shorelines need to be allowed to change in order to provide  important services such as buffering from storms, flood control, improving water quality, and providing  habitat for fish and shellfish. Historically a lot of energy has been used trying to stop the coast from changing  by building shoreline protection structures such as sea walls and dykes. A significant consequence has been  loss of coastal habitat, especially wetlands. The Nova Scotia State of the Coast Report states 80% of salt  marshes along the Bay of Fundy and 65% province  wide have been lost.  GPI Atlantic estimates the  consequences of wetland loss has cost $2.3 billion  yearly in lost ecological services like water  purification, recharging drinking waters and  enhancing fishery productivity.     Traditional and Changing Uses  Longstanding uses of Nova Scotia’s coast include  residential and industrial development as well  fishing, transportation and tourism. Recent trends  include growing residential development and  recreation.  Negative consequences of increased  activities in coastal watersheds include habitat loss,  inappropriate development, degraded water quality,  reduced public access, and property being put at risk.       Climate change  NRCAN (2007) refers to climate change as “a change in the ‘average weather’ that a given region experiences.  Average weather includes all the features we associate with the weather such as temperature, wind patterns  and precipitation. When we speak of climate change on a global scale, we are referring to changes in the  climate of the Earth as a whole.” For more information about climate change see:  From Impacts to  Adaptation: Canada in a Changing Climate (NRCAN 2007).      The role of shore cliffs in building other coastal features in  Nova Scotia. Shore cliffs (1) provide the anchor and sediment  source for building barrier beaches (2) , spits (3), tidal flats (4), and  marshes (5, 6) . NRCAN 2007   http://www.ecologyaction.ca/content/coastal    Coastal Climate Change Adaptation: An Opportunity for Nova Scotia’s Towns & Municipalities       2   Sea-level change in Halifax 1910-2010   Although there is uncertainty around specific local impacts, general effects of climate change include:    Storm surges  Flooding  Accelerated erosion    Changes in temperature &   precipitation patterns    Ocean acidification  Salt water intrusion    Changes in ocean circulation  Sea ice changes     Climate Change poses the greatest risk to:   Sensitive coastal ecosystems   Coastal infrastructure  Low lying properties    Areas of rapid coastal erosion  High storm surge       There is a scientific consensus that atmospheric warming is a  result of increased greenhouse gas emissions. Average global  temperature is expected to increase between 1 and 3.5°C by the  end of the century, resulting in sea level rise from melting ice  sheets and glaciers. In Nova Scotia, sea level rise is exacerbated  by a gradual subsidence of its land mass by 1cm/year.   Consequently, an additional sea level rise of 70-140cm is  expected over the next 100 years.  Sea level rise can amplify the  destructiveness of storms causing increased storm surge effects  (erosion and flooding). Hurricane Juan cost municipal governments  over $100 million, many of the costs associated with damaged coastal infrastructure.      What Towns and Municipalities can do!  Coastal towns and municipalities face many challenges: constantly changing coastlines and increasing human  development pressures. Add the expected impacts of climate change, and there will be even more challenges  in the future: rising costs of damaged infrastructure, protection and repair of property, public safety, water  quality and sewage, liability, and increasing public expectations.    The Ecology Action Centre thinks a comprehensive Provincial Coastal Policy will help with planning and coastal  guidelines and regulations for towns and municipalities, and provide a clearer understanding of what should  be required to protect and manage the coast in a more sustainable way.  Until such a policy is in place, there  are many climate change adaptation options available to communities that can be undertaken easily and   immediately to prepare for future change, reduce risks and save money.     Although some adaptation measures have up-front costs, the cost of inaction  may be greater in the long term. Many adaptations, like restoration of salt  marshes, yield benefits independent of climate change.  Ultimately efforts to  protect and restore a healthy coastal ecosystem have ecological and economic  benefits. The Geological Survey of Canada estimates damage to shorelines,  roads and property from Hurricane Juan (2003) was less in areas with intact  barrier beaches and salt marshes. Measures to be adopted will need to be  prioritized in order to get the greatest public good with limited resources.    Climate Change Adaptation Options   Vulnerability to climate change can be reduced through adaptation efforts  that limit exposure, and through careful planning. Integrated Community   Sustainability Plans (ICSP) will require communities to include climate change adaptation measures by 2014.  This fact sheet summarizes four core principles and specific measures relevant to Nova Scotia at this time from  the climate change adaptation literature and measures being used in other communities.     Climate Change   Adaptation: getting   ready for the changes   in our climate that   are already   happening: the slow   cumulative changes,   as well as the   catastrophic events   like major storms.      Coastal Climate Change Adaptation: An Opportunity for Nova Scotia’s Towns & Municipalities       3   Adaptation Principles  Adaptation principles represent the goals to be achieved through climate change adaptation. Specific  adaptation measures can be assessed against how well they achieve the principle. The Ecology Action Centre  suggests the following principles as relevant for Nova Scotia municipalities and towns.     1. Public safety   Make sure the risks to human health and safety are reduced by being prepared for the potential risks  from climate change such as road wash outs, falling trees, storm surges, and power failures.      2. Ensure Water Quality and Quantity   Protect existing infrastructure (drinking water and waste water systems) and protective features  (wetlands, recharge areas) to reduce to damage from intense rainfall and flooding.       3. Protect Buildings, Roads and Jobs  Ensure new development and existing coastal infrastructure are protected from the potential impacts  of climate change; reducing the long term cost of maintenance and repair, and maintaining resource  based jobs.      4. Let the Coast do the Work   Ensure natural coastal features like salt marshes and beaches, and shoreline processes (erosion and  deposition) can continue to provide to cost effective coastal protection for inland areas.     Adaptation Measures   In the Ecology Action Centre presentation  to municipalities each adaptation principle included three suggested  adaptation measures, ranging from “low” to “high” in implementation cost and technical complexity. The table  below provides an example of a range of adaptation options ranging from ‘low tech’ to ‘high tech’ measures to  ensure public safety.    Adaptation Principle: Public Safety      Adaptation measure Implementation & Relevance to Climate Change Example   Low  Identify known flood  risk and erosion areas    Use volunteers, local knowledge, topographic  maps & basic climate projections to map flood  hazard areas Reduces infrastructure losses and  human safety risks of sea level rise, storm surge  and flooding   Annapolis  Royal,  Antigonish    Med  Develop emergency  measures plans    Proactive planning and capacity building  addressing specific needs of community  increases resilience and ability to respond to  extreme climate events and flooding    Annapolis  Royal,  Colchester   County   High  LIDAR flood risk  mapping    Hire consultants to give detailed information  about flood risk areas, and vulnerability  assessments Reduces infrastructure losses and  human safety risks of sea level rise, storm surge  and flooding   Truro, HRM,  PEI, NB       Coastal Climate Change Adaptation: An Opportunity for Nova Scotia’s Towns & Municipalities       4   Adaptation Measures:   There are many possible ways to prepare for climate change.  The following table describes a few potential  adaptation measures and how they can be implemented.     Measure Implementation and Examples   Building standards Specify minimum technical and safety regulations for designing buildings to reduce the effects of flooding,  sea level rise and extreme storm events. i.e. Raising buildings on stilts.   Community  emergency measures  plans   Communities need to have plans that prevent, mitigate and prepare them for natural hazards and extreme  climatic events.  Everyone knows what they need to do (fire dept, ambulance) i.e. If the road washes out  and cuts people off.   Development/  Construction  setbacks    Restricts development a certain distance back from coast, creating barrier between development and the  sea.  Can prohibit or restrict the size/density of development, type of shore stabilization allowed, activities,  removal/cutting of vegetation and require only temporary structures (boardwalks) be built . Setbacks can  be vertical, horizontal, or both; vertical setbacks protect against flooding while horizontal setbacks protect  against erosion. Benefits: can reduce infrastructure losses, mitigate erosion and flooding, and allow coast to  change naturally.   Easements/  Rolling easements   Creates barrier similar to setbacks. Rolling easements do not restrict development but prevent landowners  from holding back the sea (no shore hardening allowed) so help maintain shoreline processes. Owners are  responsible for own repairs if coastline changes (rolls back) and there is damage.  Have minimal impact on  property values. Allows dry or intertidal land to always be available, preserving public access to the shore  and water dependent uses.  Can promote construction of small, more easily mobile structures near the  shore. Appropriate where preventing development is not feasible and shore protection is unsustainable.    Hazard mapping  (erosion and flooding)   Provides information to land owners, insurers, regulators on hazard areas so they can plan for and reduce  impact on infrastructure and human safety from riverine and coastal flooding as a result of storm surges  and heavy rains.  i.e. Locate new development away from hazards (flooding, erosion zones).   Incentives and  funding   Mandate or provide financial incentives: septic tank pump outs and repairs, water harvesting, rebates/  grants for water saving devices.  Can minimize water runoff and pollution of coastal waters.   Increase green  space/decrease hard  surfaces   Reduce hard surfaces/imperviousness and increase green space to reduce flow rates (absorb/detain) to  outfalls and minimize flooding and erosion i.e. Increase grassed areas and vegetation, create more  wetlands. Also serves to protect wetlands and coastal habitats from land pollution.    Land acquisition Purchase coastal lands to protect and preserve coastal lands, significant habitats, hazard lands (erosion),  and areas susceptible to effects of climate change. Can reduce the need for shoreline stabilization and can  protect and maintain natural shoreline processes.    Land exchange Use individual negotiation to encourage owners to exchange property in coastal areas for municipality  owned land away from shoreline. Frequently used where land is exchanged for hospital/school  developments and similar to transfer of development rights used successfully in farmland preservation.    Natural shore line  stabilization    Restore natural shoreline stabilization to better deal with erosion and natural storm surges. For example:  stabilize beaches and dunes with vegetative plantings and, restore wetlands to act as natural buffers  against erosion and storm surges - dampens wave energy.   Realignment of the  coast    Remove/abandon hardening and restore natural coastline to allow it to migrate naturally and act as a  natural buffer from rising sea level and storm surges.  Replace undersized culverts, remove dykes, enhance  and restore structural complexity and biodiversity of coastal wetlands which also act as water quality filters  and refuges and nurseries for many species.    Relocation of  structures   Relocate vulnerable and important infrastructure away from the coast. Reduces infrastructure losses &   human safety risks  i.e. Point de Chene, NB moved buildings away from shore.   Structural shore line  stabilization/shoreline  hardening   Use hardening or armouring techniques (seawalls, dykes, bulkheads) to protect critical infrastructure.   Option of last response and although may provide immediate results, may not successfully protect coastal  land in long term.    Water conservation  measures   Mitigate and plan for potential salt water intrusion of shallow aquifers and freshwater shortages i.e. water  harvesting, conservation, reclamation, grey water usage.   Zoning/ Zoning  overlay districts   Zoning by-laws are effective for guiding development on vacant land. They can regulate how much and type  of development that can occur, shoreline protection, landscaping, building materials, flood prevention,  drainage, watercourse alteration and soil removal. Zoning overlays require further requirements to certain  areas a community identifies as valuable and vulnerable (shoreline areas, erosion areas etc). Overlays sit on  top of the existing zoning ordinances land use requirements. i.e. Town of Easthampton, NY developed  coastal erosion overlay zones to regulate construction and alteration of shoreline protective structures.       Coastal Climate Change Adaptation: An Opportunity for Nova Scotia’s Towns & Municipalities       5   Adaptation Measures Case Studies  Development/Construction Setbacks:   Local governments have a variety of pre-emptive tools to manage development such as zoning, site design  regulations and setbacks.  Some examples of development setbacks in Nova Scotia include:    Halifax Regional Municipality: 30m horizontal setback from water bodies and, 2.5m vertical setback from   high water mark; within HRM Eastern Passage and Cow Bay: 61m horizontal setback from coastal waters    Some jurisdictions are choosing not to use fixed distances from the shore for setbacks:     The Maui Planning Commission (Hawaii) require development be set back 50 times the annual erosion rate  plus 20 feet; North Carolina requires new structures to be set back from the primary dune based on the  current erosion rate times 30 years for easily moveable homes/60 years for large immoveable structures.    The Michigan Land Institute recommends using resource inventories (identifying steep slopes, sand dune  crests, wetland areas, forested vegetation, and critical habitat) to determine setbacks. This ensures  protection for fragile areas, while having no impact on land owners in less sensitive areas.     Coastal Land Acquisition:   The New Jersey Department of Environment set aside funding (Blue Acres Funding Program) for municipalities  or counties to acquire important coastal lands for recreational and conservation purposes. The funding (50%  grant/50% loan) is for land that must be undeveloped, in high risk erosion areas, serves important buffering  roles, has been severely damaged by storms, or is threatened by future storms.     Rolling Easements:  Many US coastal states now restrict bulkheads and seawalls along the open ocean coast in order to protect  beaches but Maine and Rhode Island have adopted rolling easements to protect wetlands, implementing it with  prohibitions on future bulkhead construction. Texas common law recognizes rolling easements along its Gulf  coast beaches, with the purpose of preserving public access to the shore.  South Carolina amended its Beach  Front Management Act to allow for rolling easements on lots seaward of the setback line. These lots can be  developed but no hard shoreline stabilization structures can be used to protect the property. Soft erosion  control methods can be used, but if homes are damaged or destroyed during a storm, they are allowed to  rebuild only if high ground still exists.     Incentives:   The City of Guelph, Ontario offers rebates and grants for several water saving devices such as low flow toilets,  rain barrels, and grey water systems.  For example, if you install an approved rainwater harvesting system in  your home, you receive a $2,000 rebate. The Insurance Bureau of Canada and the Township of North Huron,  Ontario have partnered for a pilot project to offer more than 1,000 free rain barrels to homeowners in order  to determine whether the use of rain barrels is an effective way of keeping basements dry during intense rain  storms.  The Nova Scotia Environment Home Environment Assessment Program which ran from 2006-2010  offered rebates for pump outs, and grants for repair of septic systems.     Habitat Restoration/Coastal Realignment:  The salt marsh restoration project in Cheverie, NS (2003) where an undersized culvert was replaced restored  43 ha acres of salt marsh in the Minas Basin. A salt marsh restoration project underway in Aulac, NB will  restore 40 acres of unused agricultural land back to saltwater marsh along the Bay of Fundy. Controlled  breaching of sections of the seaward agricultural dikes on the Beauséjour marshland will help to re- established salt marsh providing a buffer protecting the new dikes that were built inland to protect the Trans- Canada highway, rail lines and private property.      Coastal Climate Change Adaptation: An Opportunity for Nova Scotia’s Towns & Municipalities       6   Selecting Measures   Each community has different risks, needs, and capacity, so each town and municipality needs to choose a  variety of adaptation measures that suit their individual community’s situation. Communities will need to  select the best combination of measures based on: technical considerations, benefits, capacity,  implementation considerations and the cost of doing something versus doing nothing.      How to Get Started    Create adaptation committee   Start with your ICSP and MPS    Gather information - what has been done?    Risk assessment - what is vulnerable?   Decide accepted level of information needed    Do cost benefit analysis for adaptation   Build partnerships, educate, and involve the community    Make wise decisions about development now!
