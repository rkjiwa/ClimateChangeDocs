Managment in Canada:    vi  Contents A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making    Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Management in Canada:  A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making Foreword  vii  Canada has 397 million hectares of forests and other woodlands, representing 10% of  the world’s forest cover. Our forests constitute a world-class natural treasure providing  ecological, economic, social, and cultural benefits to all Canadians, regardless of whether  they live in small northern communities or large urban centres. Canada is committed  to sustainable forest management, which aims to maintain and enhance the long-term  health of forested ecosystems while providing ecological, economic, cultural, and social  opportunities for present and future generations.  One of several factors that pose both opportunities and challenges in terms of effectively  and efficiently meeting our sustainable forest management goals is climate change and  its inherent uncertainties. The Canadian Council of Forest Ministers (CCFM) identified  climate change as one of two priority issues for Canada’s forest sector. In its A Vision for  Canada’s Forests: 2008 and Beyond, the CCFM stated, “Consideration of climate change  and future climatic variability is needed in all aspects of sustainable forest management.”  In addition, to minimize the risks and maximize the benefits associated with a changing  climate, Canada’s provincial and territorial premiers asked their Ministers responsible for  forest management to collaborate with the federal government on adaptation in forestry  through the CCFM’s Climate Change Task Force. Phase 1 of this work, completed in 2010,  involved a comprehensive assessment of the vulnerability of various tree species and  identified management options for adaptation. Phase 2 has gone beyond the level of  trees to look at climate change adaptation within forest ecosystems and the broader forest  sector. The goal of phase 2 was to equip members of the forest sector with a suite of tools  and state-of-the-art information to enable them to make better decisions about the need  for adaptation and the types of measures that may be most beneficial.  Over a period of 2 years, nearly 100 individuals from a wide range of organizations have  contributed to achieving this goal. The fruits of their labour have been captured in the  CCFM’s Climate Change Adaptation series, which comprises several technical reports and  review papers. This current workbook draws upon information from all the previously  published papers and reports in this series. It is a highly practical and user-oriented  workbook that will enable forestry professionals to conduct evaluations of climate change  vulnerability and potential adaptation options in a comprehensive and structured manner  as a means of making informed investment and management decisions.   It is our sincere hope that these documents, which will be used in conjunction with  workshops, seminars, and presentations, will benefit Canadian forest practitioners  from coast to coast to coast as they seek innovative ways to adapt sustainable forest  management policies and practices for a changing climate.

In some cases forest productivity will be enhanced by climate change.  However, it is expected that the overall net effect of climate change on Canada’s forest will  be negative, particularly in the absence of early adaptation (Johnston et al. 2009).   The potential effects of climate change on forests will likely have important implications  for Canada’s ability to achieve sustainable forest management (SFM) objectives and goals  as currently defined. Consequently, climate change was identified as one of two strategic  issues of national importance for Canadian forest management, and the Canadian Council  of Forest Ministers (CCFM) has recommended that consideration of both climate change  and future climatic variability is needed in all aspects of SFM (CCFM 2008).    The CCFM has identified six defining criteria that must be met for forests in Canada to  be considered as being managed sustainably (see sidebar What is Sustainable Forest  Management?). SFM is a moving target to which many managers aspire but which they  often find difficult to achieve because of dynamic environmental, economic, cultural, and  social conditions. As a consequence, SFM demands continuous monitoring, improvement,  and adjustment. With the additional stresses and pressures caused by changing climate  conditions, it is now widely acknowledged that forest managers may face unprecedented  challenges in reaching this common goal of sustainability.  Currently, SFM policies and practices are often based on an assumption that future  environmental processes and conditions shaping forests will be within the range of  variability that shaped the current forest. Under a changing climate, however, this  assumption may no longer be valid. Recognition that future climate (and hence growing  conditions, the rate and severity of natural disturbances, conditions for forest harvest  operations, etc.) will be different from the climate of the recent past and that of the  present calls for a fundamental rethinking about approaches and assumptions used  in forest management. Failure to acknowledge the new reality of climate change may  result in widespread impacts, many of which could be reduced or avoided if appropriate  adaptation actions were identified, planned, and implemented today. Information about  the vulnerability of forest management systems is needed to determine how best to  incorporate climate change considerations into definitions of SFM and into the norms,  standards, practices, and policies that are used to implement and monitor SFM.  Adaptation offers a path forward for forestry practitioners to meet the demands of  the forest sector within the context of complex socioecological systems and a rapidly  changing climate. Adaptation seeks to ensure that the breadth of ecosystem services  provided by forests and underpinning the competitiveness of Canada’s forest sector is  maintained under future climates. In other words, the purpose of adaptation is to identify   INTRODUCTION  Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Management in Canada:  A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making Introduction    What is Sustainable Forest Management?   and implement the measures necessary to reduce vulnerability to climate change and  thus to increase the likelihood that SFM objectives will be achieved. Therefore, the  fundamental goals of adaptation and SFM are the same.    Adaptation is often implemented at a local or regional scale, and it can be enabled by  institutions and policies that support adaptation actions. The need for adaptation within  forest management varies across ecosystems and is related to the vulnerability of SFM  systems relative to their ability to achieve SFM objectives under a changing climate. Tools  and knowledge that allow forest resource professionals operating at various scales to  understand climate change and to effectively and efficiently adapt to potential impacts  are required. The CCFM has addressed this need, in part, through its “Adapting Sustainable  Forest Management to Climate Change” report series (see Edwards and Hirsch 2012),  which outlines a comprehensive approach to understanding and adapting SFM to climate  change. The current guidebook is part of the series and provides a “how to” tool for  applying the CCFM adaptation framework described by Williamson et al. (2012).   Forests provide significant ecological, economic,  social, and cultural benefits to Canadians. As  development pressures on forest resources have  mounted over time, the need for a concept of forest  management that ensures conservation of healthy  forests for future generations, while allowing  for a balanced, equitable, and efficient flow of  ecological, economic, social, and cultural benefits  for current generations, has become apparent. The  concept of sustainable forest management (SFM)  was developed in response to this need. SFM has  now been embraced by forest managers across  Canada. Furthermore, demonstrating adherence to  the principles of SFM has become an international  requirement, both through international  agreements, such as the Montréal Process   (see www.montrealprocess.org), and through  various forest management processes, such as  certification.   To implement SFM and to ascertain whether it was  being achieved, a clear definition of the concept  and a mechanism or tool to monitor and measure  progress toward it were required. The Canadian  Council of Forest Ministers (CCFM) therefore  developed a national framework of criteria and   indicators to meet these dual requirements (CCFM  2006). This framework sets out six criteria for  achieving SFM:   Criterion 1. Biological diversity  Criterion 2.  Ecosystem condition and   productivity Criterion 3. Soil and water Criterion 4. Role in global ecological cycles  Criterion 5. Economic and social benefits Criterion 6. Society’s responsibility   Managing forests according to these six criteria is  far from the largely timber-focused management  approach of the past. Instead, SFM works to address  and balance a wide range of ecological, economic,  social, and cultural considerations so that the  needs and expectations of all forest users may be  met today and in the future. This comprehensive  approach requires more than just dealing with  the immediate challenges of the day; it also  requires working to predict long-term trends so  that Canadians can plan how best to maintain the  health and well-being of the country’s forests and  forest economy.   Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Managment in Canada:    2  Introduction A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making    Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Management in Canada:  A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making Introduction  3  0.2  Overview of the CCFM Framework for   Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming   Climate Change into SFM  The CCFM has developed an SFM adaptation approach that can be used by forest  resource professionals across Canada to identify how best to incorporate climate change  considerations into their SFM policies, plans, and practices. At the center of the CCFM  SFM adaptation approach, and the foundation for this guidebook, is a framework for  identifying sources of vulnerability to climate change that are important to sustainability  and developing adaptation options to reduce these vulnerabilities.   The framework, which provides a structured decision-making approach to adapting  SFM to climate change, is explained in detail in the CCFM report “Adapting Sustainable  Forest Management to Climate Change: A Framework for Assessing Vulnerability  and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making” (Williamson et al. 2012). The  framework outlines the following four stages for adaptation, which in turn encompass six  components (or steps) (see Figure 0.1):     Stage 1 – Organizational readiness: The aim of stage 1 is to explore the organization’s  readiness to undertake an SFM vulnerability and adaptation assessment (see Gray 2012).  This guidebook assumes that this stage has been completed and that the organization  is prepared to initiate an SFM vulnerability assessment and potentially to change SFM  policies and practices if required.    Stage 2 – Pre-vulnerability analysis: The aim of stage 2 is to develop the context  of the assessment, describe the current climate and climate–forest relationships, and  develop future climate and forest impact scenarios.    Stage 3 – Detailed vulnerability analysis: The aim of stage 3 is to identify where SFM  is vulnerable to climate change (and therefore where adaptation is needed) and where  opportunities or positive effects could occur (which could be enhanced by adaptation).     Stage 4 – Identify, implement, and monitor adaptation: The aim of stage 4 is to  evaluate, implement, monitor, and mainstream adaptation measures into SFM decision  making.   The adaptation framework is somewhat general in nature and nonprescriptive in terms of  concrete steps required for adaptation of SFM. This guidebook provides an approach to  moving the framework from general theory into practice.

Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Managment in Canada:    4  Introduction A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making    Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Management in Canada:  A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making About This Guidebook  5  0.3 About this Guidebook  Goal and Objectives  The intent of this guidebook is to provide practical guidance to forest resource  professionals (practitioners and policy makers) who are applying the CCFM approach  to vulnerability assessment and adaptation planning for SFM. This guidebook has the  following attributes:   •  primarily targets forestry practitioners (at the operational and planning levels) but also  recognizes the importance of supporting policy makers in mainstreaming climate  change adaptation (see sidebar Definitions)   •  focuses on how to assess the vulnerability of SFM objectives to climate change and  identify options for mainstreaming adaptation into decision making     •  is relevant to both practice and policy but is not prescriptive   •  recognizes that there is no single best method for implementing the framework  that will be suitable in all situations, given that capacity, resource availability,   management, and climate change impacts all differ widely from region to region  within Canada   •  shares key findings and lessons learned from early attempts at forestry-related  vulnerability assessments in Canada (case studies)   •  provides a structured decision-making process for acquiring climate impact  knowledge to help guide SFM adaptation decisions and actions     •  provides a framework for maintaining a record of decision making, prompting users  to document the reasoning behind changes to management policies and practices.  Overview  Each chapter in the guidebook corresponds to one of the components of the CCFM  framework for assessing vulnerability and mainstreaming adaptation, as described in  Williamson et al. (2012) and illustrated in Figure 0.1 (referred to as the framework). The  framework is a general approach that can be used by forest resource professionals across  Canada to identify how best to incorporate climate change considerations into SFM  policies and plans. Each chapter is structured around a series of worksheets (presented in  chapter 7) that are designed to assist users through the methodologies presented herein  and to help them document the results and discussions of each assessment stage. A  glossary is included to ensure common understanding of the terms used throughout this  guidebook (see Appendix 1).  Each chapter contains the following elements:   • Purpose and expected outcomes   • Worksheets:    -  Theory – provides background, based on the literature and practitioners’ experience,   and theory for the guidance being provided   Definitions  Forestry practitioners:  Forestry practitioners  are those responsible   for operational activities  and for developing forest   management plans to  achieve directions set    at the strategic level.  Policy makers: Policy  makers are those   responsible for high-level  or strategic-level plans   to develop policies and  programs that both facilitate   and guide the work of   forest practitioners.      -  Practice – provides practical guidance for completing the worksheets, along with  suggested alternative methods (a basic approach and a more comprehensive  approach) for tailoring the guidance provided to each project’s unique  circumstances     •  Case studies to demonstrate how some of the vulnerability assessment concepts  have been put into practice across Canada   •  Strategic and operational considerations for implementing methodologies  described herein, drawn from the literature and practitioner’s experiences   The purpose of each chapter and its associated worksheets are described in Table 0.1.   Although a sequential approach is recommended, it is not essential, and an iterative  process may be required as the assessment project unfolds. In addition, not all worksheets  will be useful for all projects, and it will be up to each assessment team to determine  which will be the most helpful for their project and to identify the best available method  for completing them, given the resources available.    Throughout the guidebook several methodological approaches, ranging from basic  to more comprehensive, are provided to help the user understand how to approach  the framework steps and worksheets. The approach selected will often depend on the  assessment resources available and the scope and scale of the assessment.   Users of the guidebook should seek to understand   and investigate the trade-offs inherent in selecting   one approach over another.   For example, selecting a basic approach may provide an easier and quicker route to the  next step in the vulnerability assessment process but may mean that critical aspects of  the SFM system are not considered. Conversely, a more comprehensive approach may  mean that more information and more aspects of the SFM system are considered, but  more resources and time may be required to gather the data, information, and knowledge  required to complete the assessment stage.    The steps in the CCFM adaptation framework, and the guidance presented within this  guidebook, are based on principles of structured decision making (identify objectives,  define problem, identify and assess options against objectives; see sidebar Structured  Decision Making), principles of adaptive management (plan, act, monitor, evaluate,  adjust), and decision making under uncertainty (e.g., employ scenarios to explore possible  futures).   Users are encouraged to treat every step of this guidebook  as an ongoing and iterative process, and to understand that  each step can be revisited once new knowledge is gained.   Also, although the worksheets provided represent a suggested approach to applying the  framework, users of this guidebook are encouraged to adapt them as required. However,  users should try to adhere to the concepts within the framework even if such adjustments  are made.  Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Managment in Canada:    6  About This Guidebook A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making    Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Management in Canada:  A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making About This Guidebook  7  Structured Decision Making   A process to plan for climate change adaptation  may benefit from the application of concepts  developed for decision analysis. A structured  decision-making approach represents a useful  way to guide the development, evaluation,  implementation, monitoring, and mainstreaming  of adaptation recommendations and strategies.  Structured decision making provides a useful  framework to assess when and where a particular  adaptation option may be suitable. In relation to  adaptation to climate change, structured decision  making involves establishing management  objectives for the future forest;  determining  the vulnerability of forest ecosystems, forest  communities, local economies, and human  populations;  developing alternative adaptation  options;  evaluating alternative options against  management objectives;  implementing desired  adaptation policies and practices;  monitoring  the effectiveness of climate change adaptation  efforts in achieving management objectives;  and  modifying management practices when  adaptation efforts are unsuccessful in meeting  management objectives (e.g., adaptive  management).  Articulating specific objectives  may increase the success of planning processes in  addressing long-term concerns within short-term  decisions. This approach is consistent with the  approach adopted in the CCFM report “Adapting  Sustainable Forest Management to Climate   Change: A Framework for Assessing Vulnerability  and Mainstreaming Adaptation” (Williamson et al.  2012).  Structured decision making has many similarities  to the adaptation policy framework process  suggested by the United Nations Development  Programme. Both involve assessing current  vulnerability, formulating adaptation strategies,  and then implementing, monitoring, and  improving the initiatives launched. Structured  decision making places more emphasis on the  articulation of management objectives and the  evaluation of alternative options and strategies  against these objectives. The adaptation policy  framework process places more emphasis  on who is involved in making the evaluation  (strong stakeholder engagement), on the careful  scoping of a project to ensure that it is well  integrated into a policy and planning process  (to foster implementation of results), and on  enhancing adaptive capacity. Neither approach  requires high-quality data or extensive modeling  expertise, and both approaches encourage  thoughtful assessment and a structured process.

Fortunately, many “early adapters” have completed forestry- related vulnerability assessments (e.g., CCFM case studies summary report by Johnston  and Edwards 2013), and the lessons learned and good practices are available to others via  an online community of practice (https://www.ccadaptation.ca/en/facop). The Forestry  Adaptation Community of Practice (also known as FACoP) is hosted by the Ontario Centre  for Climate Impacts and Adaptation Resources. It is a subcommunity within a broader  online climate change adaptation community of practice (http://www.ccadaptation.ca).   Everyone is welcome to join, and users of this guidebook are encouraged to use this  forum to share lessons learned and methods used to assess the vulnerability of their SFM  policies, plans, and practices.   0.5  Tools and Resources for Vulnerability  Assessment  An ever-increasing number of vulnerability assessment examples and climate change  adaptation tools are being documented and published. Many of these examples have  been related to assessing the vulnerability of forested ecosystems and developing  adaptation options to reduce these vulnerabilities.   This guidebook adds to the toolbox by going beyond the  assessment of forest ecosystems to assessing the vulnerability  of SFM goals and objectives.  Forestry-Related Vulnerability Assessment Examples   •  The CCFM vulnerability assessment case studies report (Johnston and Edwards 2013)  highlights 10 forestry-related vulnerability assessments from across Canada:   http://www.ccfm.org/pdf/ENG_CaseStudy_prf10.pdf.   •  Many projects undertaken by the Future Forest Ecosystem Scientific Council of British  Columbia involved the conduct of ecosystem vulnerability assessments:   http://www.for.gov.bc.ca/hfp/future_forests/council/index.htm.     •  The U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service has published information about its  ecosystem vulnerability assessment in northern Wisconsin (Swanston et al. 2011):   http://www.fs.fed.us/nrs/pubs/gtr/gtr_nrs82.pdf.   •  The U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service has also published information about  its vulnerability assessment of the Olympic National Forest (Halofsky et al. 2011b):   http://www.fs.fed.us/pnw/pubs/pnw_gtr844.pdf.      Vulnerability Assessment Guidance   •  The United Nations Environment Programme’s Programme of Research on Climate  Change Vulnerability, Impacts and Adaptation (also known as PROVIA) recently  published detailed guidance on conducting vulnerability assessment (Hinkel et  al. 2013).

(2012).   It is also assumed that you and  your organization are prepared  to initiate an SFM vulnerability  assessment  (see Gray 2012).    1.1 Overview  This chapter provides guidance on how to begin assessing vulnerability to climate change  and mainstreaming adaptation into SFM. The focus is to develop an understanding of the  need to address climate change and thus undertake an SFM vulnerability assessment, and  to clearly define the goals of the assessment.  This chapter also helps users of the guidebook to define the SFM system of interest by  describing the spatial extent and scope of the assessment, identifying the actors and  decision makers, understanding both the decision-making context (e.g., governance) and  the policy context, and determining if the required resources are available to conduct the  assessment as defined. Taking appropriate time at the beginning of the assessment to  clearly define the system of interest is important to success.   This chapter is structured around three worksheets that are designed to facilitate an SFM  vulnerability assessment:  Worksheet 1.1.  Define the problem or challenge  Worksheet 1.2.   Describe the SFM system and define the scope of the vulnerability  assessment  Worksheet 1.3.  Confirm the scope of the assessment   From the assessment  framework…  “A description of the context is   needed for three reasons. First, it   ensures that the goals and design   of the assessment are consistent   with the management system   and the management context   for which it will be used. Second,   it ensures a clear and direct link   between the vulnerability and   adaptation segments of the   assessment. Third, it confirms   that the organization has the   necessary capacity to complete   the assessment.”   —Williamson et al. (2012) Purpose of “providing the context” Outcomes  To initiate your SFM vulnerability  assessment by defining both the SFM  system of interest and the scope of the  assessment  •   An understanding of the reasons for  undertaking an assessment  •   A description of the SFM system that will  be assessed  •   A list of potential partners and interested  groups/individuals  •   Confirmation of the scope of the  assessment  1.2 Define the Problem or Challenge  1.2.1     The Theory  Ohlson et al. (2005) stated that “clearly formulating and specifying the management  problem is perhaps the most important and least appreciated step in the development  and evaluation of adaptation strategies.” They advocated for a direct statement of the  problem and the decision context for solving the problem before an assessment is  undertaken. Although the impacts of climate change are usually negative and can be best   Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Managment in Canada:    14  Chapter 1 A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making    Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Management in Canada:  A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making Chapter 1  15  described as problems, in some situations in Canadian forests, climate change may create  opportunities, with corresponding challenges for SFM to embrace the opportunities.   Certain factors, or triggers, often influence the desire to initiate an SFM vulnerability  assessment and adaptation planning process (see Appendix 2), including the following:    •  past extreme weather and/or weather-related events (e.g., insect infestation, fire,  flood, wind) that caused damage to forest resources or infrastructure   •  anticipated changes in climatic variability (e.g., increased frequency or magnitude of  extreme weather-related events, changes to forestry operation seasons)   • identified vulnerabilities (e.g., results of a scientific study or anecdotal evidence)   • desire to adopt “best management practices” or to be an “early-adopter”     • funding opportunities for climate change vulnerability assessment or adaptation   • desire to realize concurrent benefits (e.g., job creation, community sustainability)   • pressure from interest groups or the public to account for climate change in plans   • professional ethics   • investor or insurance demands   • risk perceptions and concerns of forest managers and the public.  Brainstorming how climate and climate change affect the system being assessed is an  effective way to better understand the problems and challenges that might need to be  considered (ICLEI 2010). The scoping step can be strengthened by explicitly considering  the question, “What might be the consequences of not undertaking a vulnerability  assessment and not adapting proactively to climate change?” (Williamson et al. 2012).  This type of localized information can also provide concrete examples of why a climate  change vulnerability assessment is needed. These examples can be valuable when seeking  resources and commitment for the assessment.  If clear factors have prompted a vulnerability assessment of SFM and some benefits of an  assessment have been defined, it may also be useful to clearly define why you wish to  proceed with the assessment and what you hope to achieve. Developing well-defined  purpose and outcome statements at this early stage can help focus the scope and  participation level of the assessment.   The outcome of defining the problem or challenge should be a direct statement that  specifies the problem to be addressed, the purpose of the vulnerability assessment, and  the expected outcomes of the assessment.   1.2.2     The Practice  Although defining the climate change problem or challenge is crucial at the initiation of  an effective climate change vulnerability assessment, this step is often not taken seriously.  As a result, the focus for the assessment may be unclear, and relevant decision makers  or interested parties may be omitted from the process. Lack of clear problem definition  may also lead to an ever-expanding assessment, which may in turn result in a fatigue of  resources, in terms of both financial support and participants’ attention.     Worksheet 1.1 (Define the problem or challenge) guides you in preparing the  statements of purpose and expected outcome after identification of the factors that have  triggered the assessment and exploration of the anticipated benefits of a vulnerability  assessment or the potential consequences of not doing so.  A basic approach Bring together your colleagues to brainstorm and complete Worksheet 1.1 (Define the  problem or challenge). If possible, include one key decision maker.   A comprehensive  approach  Invite representatives from all departments in your organization, as well as from other  organizations and agencies with SFM roles for your area. Work together to explore possible  triggers and affected decisions and decision-makers, keeping an open mind to the diversity  of views. Try to avoid seeking consensus at this stage and instead simply record the diversity  of views, as this reflects the reality that you will likely encounter during the assessment.   Operational  considerations    Be mindful of the possible implications of triggers on operational factors such as length of  the harvest season or the need for unexpected salvage harvesting. Consider which decisions  are actually made by operations personnel, including contractors and forest workers.  Strategic considerations  At the strategic scale, challenges related to climate change can affect several decisions.  For example, an increase in the area burned by wildfires can necessitate increased salvage  harvesting, change reforestation success, shift timber supply, and alter wildlife habitats, all of  which may affect strategic decisions.   Vulnerability  1.3 Define the SFM System of Interest    1.3.1     The Theory  The concept of vulnerability (see sidebar Vulnerability) that has been adopted in the  assessment framework (Williamson et al. 2012) focuses on a defined climate-sensitive  “system.” SFM is carried out through a complex, integrated socioecological system, with  elements that are more or less sensitive to climate.   Defining the SFM system of interest entails choosing and describing an appropriate  geographic (spatial) scale for the vulnerability assessment, listing the actors (i.e., those  involved in making decisions and those affected by the decisions), and describing the  larger decision-making context (e.g., policies and regulations) within which the system  resides. Clearly defining the SFM system of interest early in the vulnerability assessment  and adaptation process can help reduce barriers to adaptation later on (Moser and  Ekstrom 2010).   Canadian SFM systems encompass a defined land area and include two types of elements:    • natural biophysical elements (e.g., ecosystems, forest types, streams, wildlife)   •  human elements (e.g., individuals and organizations, institutions, built infrastructure  such as roads).  The SFM system also includes management objectives, which define the outcomes  desired from the system, and indicators used to measure achievement of these objectives.  Climate change is likely only one of several factors influencing the SFM system. Other key   “The degree to which  a system is susceptible  to, and unable to cope  with, adverse effects of  climate change, including  climate variability and  extremes. Vulnerability is a  function of the character,  magnitude, and rate  of climate change and  variation to which a system  is exposed, its sensitivity,  and its adaptive capacity.”   —(Parry et al. 2007)   Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Managment in Canada:    16  Chapter 1 A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making    Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Management in Canada:  A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making Chapter 1  17  factors of change, such as local land-use trends and global economic trends, should also  be included in your description of the SFM system.    Explicitly describing your SFM system ensures that the vulnerability assessment addresses  all the climate-sensitive dimensions of the system and takes into account the nonclimatic  factors that may exacerbate or lessen climate vulnerabilities. The following sections  provide background information on describing your SFM system.  Defining the Spatial Scale  The factors prompting a vulnerability assessment and adaptation planning project can aid  in defining your assessment area, as they may indicate the spatial scale at which the issue  is best examined. The appropriate spatial scale is often related to the decision context  (or contexts) within which the issue is best addressed. Generally, the greater the scale of  the issue, the more complex the assessment (with more stakeholders [interested parties],  more policy linkages, etc.). Many climate change issues operate across multiple scales, a  consideration that should be taken into account within any vulnerability assessment and  adaptation planning project. For more information, see Theme 1: Spatial and Temporal  Context in Gray (2012).  Local area – A smaller area provides the opportunity to explore vulnerability and  adaptation to climate change in a very specific biogeographic and political context  (e.g., a community forest or woodlot). Such assessments tend to be more operational in  nature and the local management objectives may be more clearly defined compared  with regional or national scales (see “Case study – Local area: Site prescriptions for fuel  abatement and biodiversity conservation in Jasper National Park”).   A lesson learned from  forestry vulnerability  assessment case studies  (Johnston and   Edwards 2013):  Defining the SFM system of interest,   the scale, the scope, and the level of   participation are the most critical   steps in a vulnerability assessment.   An assessment that is well matched   to available resources and has the   appropriate level of engagement   from interested parties is likely to be   more successful in implementing   adaptation options and reducing   barriers to new approaches and   practices.  Case Study – Local area:  Site prescriptions for  fuel abatement and  biodiversity conservation  in Jasper National Park  For communities located at the wildland–urban interface, climate change may be of  increasing concern because of anticipated changes in the forest fire regime. The FireSmart  manual (Partners in Protection 2003), developed by the Partners in Protection program  to support fuel abatement around communities, has been adopted and implemented  by many communities across Canada, including Jasper National Park. Consistent with the  principles of SFM, Jasper National Park has successfully integrated the management of other  values, such as biodiversity and visual esthetics, into its site prescriptions for fuel abatement.  While this example does not explicitly deal with climate change, it is an example of the  operational nature of local risk and vulnerability assessments.   Source: Westhaver (2007).   Regional area – Regional assessments (e.g., for a watershed, timber supply area, or forest  district) represent a level of complexity above that of local studies. Assessments at this  scale tend to demand more integration between different decision-making contexts,  involve a larger number of stakeholders (or interested parties), and require more careful  examination of trade-offs in the exploration of adaptation options. Regional assessments  often address both strategic and operational considerations. Examples of regional area  vulnerability assessments are highlighted in Johnston and Edwards (2013), and one  example is summarized in “Case study – Regional area: Southwest Yukon.”    Case Study – Regional  area: Southwest Yukon  The southwest Yukon has provided an ideal location for examining climate change  vulnerability and adaptation. Accumulating evidence suggests that the Champagne and  Aishihik First Nations (CAFN) Traditional Territory (CATT) in southwest Yukon is already  experiencing the impacts of climate change. Warmer winters and warmer, drier summers  beginning in the early 1990s have contributed to a severe spruce beetle outbreak affecting  almost 400 000 ha of white spruce forest (of an estimated 600 000 ha) in the CATT. This  is the largest and most intense recorded outbreak of spruce beetle in Canada. Climate  change played a critical role in increasing the population of beetles to epidemic levels,  a phenomenon exacerbated by the large tracts of mature white spruce characterizing  the forests in this region. Also, since the mid-1990s, the spruce beetle outbreak has been  driving forest management and planning efforts in the affected region. In December 2004,  a Strategic Forest Management Plan (SFMP) for the CATT was jointly approved by the  CAFN and the Government of Yukon. The plan identifies reduction of fire hazard, renewal  of beetle-killed forests, provision of economic benefits, and preservation of wildlife habitat  as priorities. In April 2006, the CAFN and the Government of Yukon jointly set a salvage  harvest level for this zone of up to 1 million cubic meters of beetle-affected timber over 10  years. Climate change impacts are likely to affect whether the community-directed SFMP  goals, which include having functioning forest ecosystems and providing community  sustainability and benefits, can be achieved. Although planning has been driven by a  climatically induced outbreak, climate change adaptation was not an explicit consideration  in the planning process. To explore the possibilities for such adaptation further, 30  local forest practitioners engaged in a participatory process to identify climate change  vulnerabilities and evaluate alternative adaptation options. A structured decision-making  approach was used to frame the assessment. The existence of regional management  objectives greatly facilitated the evaluation of over 80 adaptation options. Practitioners  identified 24 of these adaptation options as being important to implement to achieve the  regional goals and objectives of sustainable forest management in light of climate change.  Source: Ogden and Innes (2009).   National or provincial/territorial area – Not all issues lend themselves to assessment  locally or regionally, and some climate change vulnerabilities and opportunities are  best addressed at a larger scale. An example of a larger-scale project is the assessment  examining the risk of the mountain pine beetle spreading beyond British Columbia  to eastern pine forests. The National Forest Pest Strategy facilitated this assessment,  with input being required from jurisdictions in both western and central Canada (see  “Case study – National area: National Forest Pest Strategy”). The outcome of a provincial,  territorial, or national assessment may include the establishment of broad policies  providing guidance and support for adaptation planning at regional and local scales.  These studies tend to be more strategic in nature.  In many cases, successful adaptation processes combine policy making with proactive  risk management. In this way, key adaptation priorities are identified and addressed at the  appropriate level.

In 2007, forest managers and scientists tested the risk  assessment approach of the NFPS on a real-world question: Would the mountain pine beetle  outbreak, already spreading beyond British Columbia, present a threat to Canada’s boreal and  eastern pine forests? Combining biological evidence, climate change trends, and computer  simulations, the researchers concluded that the beetle does pose a real risk to the boreal  forest. This assessment has led to calls for attempts to slow the beetle’s spread eastward, to  give resource industries and governments time to address the susceptibility of their forests.

A detailed description of forest ecosystems and their existing natural  drivers of change (e.g., fire dynamics, forest pest dynamics) is a useful starting point for a  vulnerability assessment. Nonforested ecosystems (e.g., wetlands, grasslands) may also be  included, as climate change is likely to affect these ecosystems and may influence SFM  practices and adaptation options.   Human Elements of the SFM System  SFM systems include a variety of human elements (e.g. individuals, organizations,  governance structures, institutions) that influence how decisions are made and  implemented. It is essential to account for these human elements in an SFM vulnerability  assessment. For example, it may be useful to consider individuals, agencies, organizations,  or governments with the following characteristics:   • involved in overall land management or partnered in the management of the area   • involved in reviewing or approving plans or in regulatory compliance or enforcement   • holding land-use tenures   •  in a position to affect decisions for the area   •  in a position to be affected by decisions for the area.  Individuals within the SFM system will include personnel from these organizations,  including managers and professional and operational staff, as well as individuals who are  not affiliated with any particular organization but who are interested in the area for other  values, such as recreation users and the general public.    SFM Management Objectives  Defining management objectives is a key task within the SFM vulnerability assessment  framework, as it is these objectives that form the basis of the assessment.   The central question of an SFM vulnerability assessment is  whether SFM objectives can be met with current policies and  practices, given the current climate and a range of potential  future climates.   Most forest management plans in Canada include clearly stated management objectives  that define the desired future forest conditions or economic and societal outcomes of  management actions, with criteria and measurable indicators to report progress toward  meeting those objectives (see sidebar Canadian Council of Forest Ministers’ Criteria  and Indicators Framework). For many forest management plans with third-party  certification, these objectives and indicators may already be well defined.   Key Nonclimatic SFM Factors  Climate change vulnerability assessments should not be conducted in isolation from other  key management factors that already have influenced SFM (or may influence SFM over  time). Today, many Canadian forest-sector operations must contend with competition for  workers, an aging workforce, severe financial pressures, and shifts in land use and public  values. Climate change is a cross-cutting issue that should be considered along with other  factors of change. The impacts of climate change may inhibit or enhance the effects of  these other factors. Likewise, these other factors may affect the ability to successfully  implement adaptation options.  Canadian Council of Forest Ministers Criteria and Indicators Framework  The Canadian Criteria and Indicators Framework of the Canadian Council of Forest Ministers (CCFM) is a  science-based framework used to define and measure Canada’s progress in SFM. The criteria represent  forest values that Canadians want to enhance or sustain, with the indicators identifying scientific factors  that can be used to assess the state of the forests and measure progress over time (see Appendix 3 for the  list of current CCFM SFM Criteria and Indictors).   The framework was created in 1995 and was most recently updated in 2003 (CCFM 2003).   A national status report was prepared in 2005 (CCFM 2006).   For additional information on the CCFM Criteria and Indicators see   http://www.ccfm.org/english/coreproducts-criteria_in.asp.  Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Managment in Canada:    20  Chapter 1 A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making    Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Management in Canada:  A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making Chapter 1  21  1.3.2     The Practice  In practice, a number of issues may drive adaptation, thus influencing the aspects of  the SFM system that should be assessed. Consider the problems or challenges that you  identified in Worksheet 1.1 as having prompted this assessment, to aid in defining the  scale, boundaries, and elements of the SFM system to be considered in the assessment.  Describe the SFM system in enough detail to give all assessment participants a good  understanding of the biophysical aspects (i.e., the forest ecosystems) within the defined  geographic scale, the benefits and values derived from the forests within this area, and  the decision contexts and the stakeholders or interested parties within the defined  assessment scope.   Worksheet 1.2 (Describe the SFM system and define the scope of the vulnerability  assessment) provides guidance on describing the SFM system of interest and defining  the scope of the SFM vulnerability assessment.  A basic approach A local-level, single-driver assessment tends to be the simplest approach. You may wish to  constrain the boundaries of your assessment to something at this scale, particularly if you  have limited resources and/or a desire to gain some experience in vulnerability assessment  and adaptation planning before taking on a more complex and challenging assessment at a  broader level.  A comprehensive  approach  A more comprehensive approach depends on your unique situation. Scoping the most  appropriate SFM area to address your needs, given available resources, is the ideal approach.  Also, no matter the scale at which your SFM area is defined, it is essential to pay attention to  cross-scale issues and considerations.   Operational  considerations    Keeping your decision-making context in mind may help in determining the SFM system  for the assessment. Matching your SFM system to the decisions that you wish to inform  may help to enhance the uptake of the vulnerability assessment and its relevance to the  decision-making process.  Strategic considerations  Is your vulnerability assessment and adaptation planning process being driven by a single  issue or vulnerability? Or is there a desire to perform a comprehensive assessment that  examines all potential vulnerabilities? Consider these questions as you decide upon the  SFM system for the assessment. Having a clear notion of your SFM system will help you  to target your assessment and information-gathering process and to more clearly define  the interested parties, stakeholder groups, and/or assessment partners. Also, keep in mind  that climate change may interact with other drivers of change, such as changes in markets  conditions or workforce availability and new technologies.  You may want to build a  team work plan and a team  charter to outline each  member’s commitments  and tasks for the  vulnerability assessment.  You may also wish to  consider a communications  plan that defines the key  participants and interested  parties and how you plan  to involve them in the  assessment process and  communicate to them the  progress and results of the  assessment.  H I N T    1.4 Confirm the Scope of the Assessment   1.4.1 The Theory  At this early stage, vulnerability assessments can be complex and time-consuming. They  can also be frustrating and unproductive if the scope does not match the resources  available, leading to the withdrawal of participants from the climate change adaptation  process. One important rule of thumb is to start with the simplest representation of the  problem, increasing the complexity only as required (Ohlson et al. 2005).  Scaling an assessment to realistically match the resources available is essential at this early  stage of climate change adaptation. Effectively exploring one aspect of the identified  problem that leads to proactive adaptation and ongoing learning may be much more  desirable than not initiating assessment and adaptation at all. Other aspects of the  identified problems and challenges can then be assessed over time as part of an adaptive  management approach, keeping in mind that the adaptation process is ideally an  ongoing and iterative process (i.e., it is mainstreamed into day-to-day decision making).  Achieving buy-in and support from all organizations and interested parties involved in  the SFM system of interest is important for the success of the vulnerability assessment.  Identifying a strong champion is another key aspect of success (Johnston and Edwards  2013).  1.4.2     The Practice  Worksheet 1.3 (Confirm the scope of the assessment) guides you in examining the  resources required to undertake the assessment as defined. If you are unable to secure all  of the necessary resources, you may need to prioritize and focus on specific aspects of the  problem identified in Worksheet 1.1. If the scope changes, a new purpose and outcome  statement should be prepared.  It may be necessary to garner further support, both financial and political, to conduct the  vulnerability assessment as defined. Creating a short, clear summary of the vulnerability  assessment project may be useful for presenting the assessment concepts to decision  makers and other interested parties in efforts to gain support.   A lesson learned from  forestry vulnerability  assessment case studies  (Johnston and   Edwards 2013)  Identifying a strong champion   of the vulnerability assessment is   one key aspect to success.   Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Managment in Canada:    22  Chapter 1 A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making    Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Management in Canada:  A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making Chapter 1  23  A basic approach If you are doing a quick or cursory assessment that involves only in-house resources, focus  the scope by identifying and securing those resources that are available in-house, and keep  the spatial scale of the assessment small.  A comprehensive  approach  Develop an inventory of internal and external resources that is as comprehensive as  possible. The scope and complexity of an assessment is often dictated by the resources  available, so be as thorough as possible in preparing your inventory.  Operational  considerations    Regularly revisit your inventory of available resources. The availability of resources may  change over time, so review resource requirements regularly and be on the lookout for  opportunities to take advantage of additional resources.  Strategic considerations  If resources are limited, do not be dismayed. Although having more resources may increase  the information available to serve as a basis for the assessment, there will remain many  irreducible uncertainties related to climate change. Focusing available resources into a  “smart” process may pay more dividends than throwing a lot of resources at an ill-conceived  process. Resource constraints can help to focus efforts, prioritize activities, and stimulate the  development of innovative methods for assessing vulnerability and adaptation options.  Chapter 1 Completion Check-in  Has the assessment team:      Understood the reasons for doing an SFM vulnerability assessment?     Developed a clear statement of purpose for the assessment and a statement of  expected outcomes?    Described the spatial extent and forest structure of the area of interest?    Described the decision-making scope and actors within the SFM system of interest?     Assessed whether the available resources match the purpose and expected  outcomes?    Confirmed the scope of the assessment?     Made an explicit decision to go forward with the vulnerability assessment and  adaptation process?  The assessment team may also wish to:     Develop a team charter and work plan detailing responsibilities and timelines for  individuals and organizations participating in the assessment     Develop a communications plan to ensure that decision makers and other  interested parties (e.g., stakeholders) are kept informed of the purpose and progress  of the assessment     1.5 Literature Cited  [CCFM] Canadian Council of Forest Ministers. 2003.

It also provides  guidance on documenting any current adaptations to climate change that you may  already be practicing. The chapter is structured around four worksheets that are designed  to facilitate the gathering of climate information; the identification of relationships among  climate, forest conditions, and current forest management policies and practices; and the  recording of uncertainties and knowledge gaps:   Worksheet 2.1.  Describe climatic conditions and trends  Worksheet 2.2.   Describe the relationships among climate, forest conditions, and forest  management practices  Worksheet 2.3.   Describe how recent climate trends or changes in forest conditions have  led to changes in current forest management practices   Worksheet 2.4.  Identify uncertainties and knowledge gaps  From the assessment  framework…  “Determining and describing   how forests are being affected   by, and how forest managers   have adapted to, current climate,   clarifies relationships among   climate, forests, and current   management.”  —Williamson et al. (2012)  Purpose of “describing current   climate and forest conditions”  Outcomes  •   To document and understand how  climate has shaped current forest  conditions and management practices  •   To identify any recent changes in climate  trends and variability   •   To document how current forest  management practices have changed as  a result of changes in climate  •   Description of current climate and  forest conditions  •   Improved understanding of the  relationships among climate, forest  conditions, and forest management  •   Identification of any recent changes in  climate that have resulted in changes to  forest management practices  •   A list of uncertainties and knowledge  gaps    2.2 Describe Climate Normals, Trends, and Variations  2.2.1     The Theory  Across Canada, the climate has already started to change (Lemmen et al. 2008).  However,  SFM in Canada has, until recently, been based on the assumption that climate in a local  area is relatively stable, within a known range of historical variability. As such, changes in  climate have not been considered as a major factor affecting long-term decisions (see  sidebar Climate terms).    The climate measures that are important to document are those that might affect the   SFM system. Although measures of annual climate conditions are helpful, the climate  across Canada varies with the season, so seasonal measures are also important.  Understanding current  climate and how any  recent changes in climate  trends or variability have  affected your forest  management practices  can make assessing  future vulnerabilities less  daunting.  H I N T  Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Managment in Canada:    26  Chapter 2 A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making    Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Management in Canada:  A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making Chapter 2  27  Climate Terms  Weather – The day-to-day and hour-to-hour atmospheric conditions at a given  location.  Extreme weather event – An event that is rare within the weather conditions at  a particular place.   Climate – The “average weather” described in terms of the mean and variability  of features such as temperature, precipitation, and wind over a period ranging  from months to thousands or millions of years. The usual period for describing  climate in Canada is 30 years.   Climate variability – The highs and lows of climate conditions over a long  period.  Climate change – A statistically significant change in either the average (mean)  state of the climate or in its variability, measured over an extended period,  usually at least 30 years.   Climate trends – Data providing a picture of how much change has occurred  in the past, for example, over a period of 50 to 100 years. Climate trends are  derived from statistical analysis of historical climate data.  2.2.2     The Practice  In most places in Canada, the climate has changed during recent decades. A national  assessment of climate change impacts reported by Lemmen et al. (2008) provided  national- and regional-scale information about historical climate changes, known as  “trends” (see section for national information in Information Resources box, below). More  detailed regional or local information may be available for specific areas from national  or regional climate information centers (see sections for western and eastern Canada in  Information Resources box, below).  The climate information that has been collected by the Meteorological Service of Canada  at weather stations across the country has been analyzed to generate “climate normals” for  these station locations. Climate normals describe the average conditions over a 30-year  period. Normals are available for three overlapping 30-year periods from 1961–1990 up  to the most recent period of 1981–2010 (1961–1990, 1971–2000, 1981–2010). Comparing  selected climate variables for the three climate normal periods may help to illustrate  changes in climate.   It can also be helpful to  collect climate measures  for recent extreme weather  events (e.g., heavy rain or  snow, drought, windstorm).  Recent global analyses by  Field et al. (2012) provide  accepted methodologies  for describing the  frequency and severity   of these events.  H I N T    In addition, detailed historical climate data can be downloaded and analyzed for individual  stations across Canada. Graphs of annual mean temperature and precipitation are helpful  to illustrate local climate variability and trends. Analysis of these data should be conducted  with the advice of a climate specialist.   Observations by individuals who have spent a lot of time (e.g., several decades) in your  SFM area are also valuable for describing changes in local climate conditions or extreme  weather-related events (see sidebar How important are local observations?). These  individuals are likely to have observed effects of climate change or extreme weather  events that may not be obvious from analysis of climate data. Human memory is not  always reliable, however, so climate data should be sought to corroborate any changes  that are thought to have created significant ecological, economic, cultural, or social  impacts. This sharing and linking of local, traditional, and scientific knowledge can foster  ongoing exchanges, facilitate continuous learning, and provide momentum for effective  and practical adaptation responses (Gray 2012).   How Important are Local Observations?  People who work day-to-day in climate-sensitive resource industries (e.g.,  forestry or agriculture) tend to have an intimate understanding of their local  surroundings and of how the current local climate affects their respective  management systems. They often understand the local climate and have some  sense of their vulnerability to climate and climate variability.   For example, forest managers will likely know when the most recent severe  fire years occurred and will recall what combination of high-temperature days  and periods without rainfall contributed to them. When such relationships are  established, it becomes easier to answer questions such as, What would happen  if conditions become hotter and drier?  What would happen if the hot and dry  conditions that contributed to a severe fire year become “normal” conditions at  some point in the future?  Long-time residents from the SFM area who spend much of their time on the  land (e.g., hunters, backcountry recreationists, First Nations people) can also  provide valuable observations of climate and environmental changes. Efforts  to combine these observations with climate data through events such as  workshops can often lead to rewarding discussions between local residents,  forest managers, and researchers.   Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Managment in Canada:    28  Chapter 2 A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making    Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Management in Canada:  A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making Chapter 2  29  Worksheet 2.1 (Describe climatic conditions and trends) provides a format for  recording climate trends, climate normals, and sources of information about climate  variability.  A basic approach At the Government of Canada climate website (http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_ normals/index_e.html), find climate data for at least one location that is near your SFM  system of interest. Interpolated climate data for any geographic location in Canada can  also be downloaded from the Canadian Forest Service’s regional, national, and international  climate modeling website (http://cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/projects/3/6) (see Information resources  box below).  A comprehensive  approach  Include on the team a climate scientist who can analyze historical climate data and prepare  future projections. Analysis of data from local climate stations can provide information about  change and variability for a number of relevant climate measures.   Operational  considerations    Examples of climate measures that are important for day-to-day operations include changes  in the number of frost-free days, the number of high and extreme fire hazard days, and the  winter access season.  Information resources National     •  The Government of Canada’s Climate website provides historical hourly, daily, and   monthly weather data as well as 30-year climate normals for many weather stations  across Canada (http://www.climate.weather.gc.ca).     •  Natural Resources Canada, Canadian Forest Service: regional, national, and international  climate modeling (http://cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/projects/3/6), specifically the web application  for obtaining climate estimates for your location   (http://gmaps.nrcan.gc.ca/cl_p/climatepoints.php).  Western Canada    •  ClimateWNA (Western North America) is a program to generate high resolution climate   data for western North America. See   http://cfcg.forestry.ubc.ca/projects/climate-data/climatebcwna/#ClimateWNA for  details.  Eastern Canada    •  Ouranos is a consortium that brings together 400 scientists and professionals from   different disciplines. Based in Quebec, Ouranos focuses on two main themes: “climate  sciences and vulnerabilities” and “impacts and adaptation” (http://www.ouranos.ca).    2.3  Determine Relationship of Climate to Current  Forest Conditions and Forest Ecosystem  Processes  2.3.1     The Theory  Climate is a fundamental driver of forest ecosystems and therefore influences many forest  management activities. Understanding how climate influences current forest conditions  (e.g., species composition and productivity) and ecosystem processes (e.g., fire and insect  disturbances, regeneration, nutrient cycling) is critical to forest management planning  and operations (see “Case study – Canadian Forest Service Forest Change Initiative”).  Exploring these relationships at this stage of the vulnerability assessment can help create  an understanding about why current forest management practices have been established  or current policies instituted and how these policies and practices may have changed in  response to recent changes in climate and weather. Additionally, highlighting key linkages  between climate and forest conditions can assist in the development of future forest  impact scenarios (chapter 3).  2.3.2     The Practice  Take a close look at your current forest management policies and practices to see how  climate has influenced the decisions made during implementation of these policies  and practices (e.g., growth and yield projections, seasonal operation plans, silvicultural  operations). You may also draw on the knowledge of forest practitioners, local residents,  or academic researchers to help identify the relationships of climate to current forest  conditions and processes. Use Worksheet 2.2 (Describe the relationships among  climate, forest conditions, and forest management practices) to list the relationships  of climate to forest conditions and of forest conditions to management practices (see  Appendix 4 for examples of forest conditions and ecosystems processes to consider).  From the assessment  framework…  “Assessing current climate and   forest conditions is an important   step in the vulnerability   assessment framework because   it allows managers to describe   what they know with some   certainty.”  —Williamson et al. (2012)  Case Study –  Canadian  Forest Service “Forest  Change” initiative  Forest Change is a new Canadian Forest Service initiative for enhancing forest-sector  competitiveness in a changing climate. The initiative has three main deliverables:     •  a tracking system to report indicators of climate change impacts on forests and the  forest sector in Canada      • an adaptation toolkit for SFM under a changing climate     •  an integrated assessment of the implications of climate change for Canada’s forests and  forest sector, to inform policies and investment by the public and private sectors.  These deliverables aim to generate the most current knowledge about climate change  impacts on Canada’s forests and to make this knowledge available to practitioners in usable  and accessible formats.

The forest  sector has adapted to recent changes in markets by innovating new products for market,  increasing efficiency of operations, and developing new forest management practices  in response to new societal values (e.g., biodiversity). Given this inherent adaptability  of forest management systems in Canada, it is likely they have already adapted to any  recent changes in the climate (i.e., over the past decade or two) and any impacts these  changes may have had on forests or forest operations, and it may be helpful to identify  any such adaptations. For example, have forest policies or practices been adapted in  response to outbreaks of mountain pine beetle or other pests associated with changes in  climate? Have any changes been made to duration of winter harvest because of changes  in frozen soil conditions or lake ice-in conditions (i.e., for winter roads)? Have there been  any changes to the wildfire season (e.g., earlier start dates or later end dates) that have  increased the length of time that wildfire crews are required on active duty? See “Case  study –‘Climate change and Canada’s Forests’” for additional ways climate change is  already affecting Canada’s forests.  2.4.2     The Practice  Examine your current SFM policies and practices and see if you can identify any changes  (i.e., adaptations) that have been made as a result of recent changes to climate or climate  variability. This activity can be done by a smaller assessment team or by engaging a  broader audience in a workshop setting to gather tacit knowledge of changes that might  not be well documented. You may want to start by identifying a recent unanticipated  event (e.g., a large wildfire or insect outbreak, an extreme precipitation event, a market  downturn) and then describing how that event affected your ability to manage forests  sustainably and what changes to management practices or policies were made to  account for the impacts of this event.  Record these observations in Worksheet 2.3 (Describe how recent climate trends or  changes in forest conditions have led to changes in forest management practices).    2.5 Key Uncertainties and Knowledge Gaps  2.5.1     The Theory  Climate change is characterized by substantial uncertainty. You will likely encounter a  number of knowledge gaps and uncertainties (e.g., concerning the relationship between  forest conditions and climate) while completing the previous worksheets on climate and  forest conditions. Key knowledge gaps and uncertainties are often a barrier to successful  adaptation, as they can cause the vulnerability assessment process to stall or stop. The  point of recording them here is simply to acknowledge their existence. This list will be a  great starting point to adaptation option planning (chapter 5).   Case Study  – “Climate  Change and Canada’s  Forests”   This document, a compilation of contributions from the authors of the forestry sections  in the Canadian national assessment (Lemmen et al. 2008) states that “Climate change is  already affecting Canada’s forests.” They list the following recent changes in Canada’s forests  that are related in some way to recent climate change:     •  longer growing seasons, earlier bud burst and flowering in some species, and upward  expansion of treelines to encroach upon alpine ecosystems     •  nationwide drought in 2001–2003, which was unprecedented in terms of its duration,  geographic extent, and (in some locations) severity and which resulted in aspen  dieback in some parts of the prairies and devastating fire seasons in British Columbia  and Yukon     •  more frequent occurrence of extreme wildfire seasons, with severe burning conditions  at times of the year when they have not previously occurred     •  epidemic of mountain pine beetle in western Canada, resulting from large areas of  mature lodgepole pine and an unprecedented number of abnormally warm winters in  consecutive years     •  the largest outbreak of spruce bark beetle ever recorded in Yukon     •  epidemic of Dothistroma needle blight in young and mature lodgepole pine in  northwest British Columbia.  These changes illustrate that impacts are often the result of interacting factors (e.g.,  mountain pine beetle epidemic due to large areas of mature pine and warm winters). As  well, climate change has the potential to cause multiple, interacting impacts that occur  simultaneously. For example, changes in the risks of drought, fire, insect and disease  disturbance, and extreme weather, as well as changes in growth and yield, may all occur at  the same time. As a result, foresters must be able to recognize, understand, and adapt to the  cumulative impacts of climate change.  Source: Williamson et al. (2009).

CHAPTER 3     FUTURE CLIMATE AND   FOREST IMPACT SCENARIOS    3.1 Overview   This chapter provides guidance on developing and describing future climate and forest  impact scenarios. It is structured around two worksheets that are designed to characterize  a range of possible future climate scenarios and associated forest impact scenarios:  Worksheet 3.1.  Develop and describe future climate scenarios   Worksheet 3.2.  Develop and describe forest impact scenariosFrom the assessment  framework…  “Forest management is   inherently a long-term   undertaking, and assessing SFM   vulnerability therefore requires   estimation of the potential future   positive and negative impacts   of climate change on forests.   However, the potential impacts   of future climate change on   forests are uncertain. The third   component of the vulnerability   assessment framework therefore   involves the development of   scenarios of future climate and   forest conditions.”  —Williamson et al. (2012)  Purpose of “developing scenarios” Outcomes  Develop and characterize scenarios that  encompass the range of potential future  climate and the related impacts on forest  ecosystems  •   Selection and description of climate  change scenarios  •   Creation of forest impact scenarios   •   Updated list of uncertainties and  knowledge gaps related to future  climate change and forest impact  scenarios  Scenarios for an Uncertain Future   Many aspects of the SFM system are weather-sensitive, and therefore SFM vulnerability  and adaptation assessment should be based on expectations about what the future  effects of climate change may be on the natural biophysical and human elements of  the SFM system (see definitions in section 1.3.1). Weather and climate conditions affect  growing conditions and tree, stand, and landscape processes, as well as infrastructure  stability (e.g., roads and bridges) and human activities. Climatic change will modify future  weather conditions and therefore can be expected to modify forest structure, species  distribution, productivity, and disturbance patterns. Climate change will also affect  physical attributes of the landscape such as permafrost, soil stability, and water regimes.  Such modifications have important implications for the ability to achieve SFM objectives  in the long run and for decision making today.  The Need for Scenarios   Future climate change and the effects that such change may have on forest ecosystems  are highly uncertain, in part because of limited, though ever-growing, knowledge of  climate systems and forest ecosystems, but also because of the impossibility of predicting  future human behaviors and values. In this situation of uncertainty, one option is to  create a single prediction or forecast for the future (e.g., “this is what will happen”), using  information generated by models or based on scientific knowledge and inference,  and then to use this prediction to make decisions. Exclusively relying on this option,  however, has a number of limitations, including the fact that model results are subject to  assumptions and inherent uncertainty, especially over the time scales relevant to forest  management planning. In fact, it is not possible currently, and may never be possible, to  create a single accurate prediction of climate and SFM impacts for decades into the future,  especially at time scales relevant to operational decision making.   Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Managment in Canada:    36  Chapter 3 A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making    Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Management in Canada:  A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making Chapter 3  37  Inability to predict future impacts with confidence can be a significant barrier to  vulnerability and adaptation assessment. An alternative approach is to develop a number  of plausible scenarios (e.g., “this is what might happen”) describing a range of possible  futures and to use these scenarios as a foundation to guide the exploration of climate  change impacts and the implications of adaptation decisions (see “Case study – Forest  Futures project”).   Scenarios Defined   The creation of scenarios is a well-developed technique for planning under uncertainty  (see sidebar The Power of Scenarios in Climate Change Adaptation). A scenario is  not a single prediction or forecast, which would imply that a particular outcome is likely  to occur. Rather, a scenario represents one of any number of possible futures. As such,  scenarios are constructed stories about conditions that could occur in the future. It is  essential that scenarios be logical, internally consistent, and believable portrayals of  possible future conditions.   Berkhout et al. (2002) described approaches for scenario development in the context of  climate change assessment with four underlying principles for scenario analysis:    (1)  recognizing that past trends do not provide a basis for projecting the future   (2)  accepting that the future cannot be predicted with certainty but that “exploring”  possible futures can inform decision making   (3)  accepting uncertainty and recognizing that any one of a number of different  futures could occur    (4)  acknowledging that local knowledge is fundamentally important for successful  scenario development.  The Power of  Scenarios in Climate  Change Adaptation  By illustrating possible future  settings, scenarios can be  used as a tool for long- term planning and decision  making in the present. They  shift the analytical focus  away from estimating the  most likely path, which is  unknown in a changing  climate, toward determining  the range of consequences  of potential changes and  the most appropriate  adaptations across these  different situations (i.e., robust  adaptation options). For  this reason, Berkhout et al.  (2002) referred to scenarios  as “learning machines.” A  scenario does not imply  “This is what will happen,  and this is what you should  do about it.” Rather, a set of  well-constructed scenarios  indicate “This is what could  happen in the future” and ask  the question “What would   you do about it now if this  were to happen?”  Case Study – Forest  Futures project   A recent example of an exercise involving integrated scenario development in forestry is the  Forest Futures project completed by the Sustainable Forest Management Network, led by Dr. Peter  Duinker (Dalhousie University). The Forest Futures project used a structured process to develop  scenarios for “plausible” futures across a range of uncertain conditions, including climate change,  and to explore the implications of those scenarios for the many benefits that Canadians derive  from forested lands.   Central to the project were a series of national and regional workshops used to identify the  drivers of future change, to define plausible scenarios, and to analyze those futures from various  perspectives. The process was designed to involve a large number of people from many forest  stakeholder groups and to integrate their expertise and insight into the project’s outcomes.   The overall objective of the Forest Futures project was to produce a set of documents that inform  the scenarios and analyses, which can in turn be used to inform decision making by industry,  governments, and other groups interested in Canadian forests.   The products of the Forest Futures project—scenario descriptions, research papers describing  drivers, workshop proceedings, and analysis documents—are available online at:   http://www.sfmn.ales.ualberta.ca/en/Research/ForestFutures/ForestFuturesDocuments.aspx.     3.2 Develop and Describe Future Climate Scenarios  3.2.1     The Theory  Climate change scenarios are derived from climate models, which are in turn driven  by projections of changes in atmospheric greenhouse gases (primarily carbon dioxide)  resulting from alternative scenarios of future socioeconomic development. There are many  plausible future climate scenarios because there are a number of different climate models  and many possible scenarios of socioeconomic development.   The resolution of most global climate models is too coarse for use in vulnerability  assessments of SFM. Methods such as downscaling can be used to produce climate  scenarios at a scale more useful for assessing SFM vulnerability. Price et al. (2011)  presented a series of high-resolution interpolations of climate scenarios for Canada. Many  regional climate centers (e.g., Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium, Ouranos) are excellent  sources of climate information and scenarios. Additionally, Price and Isaac (2012) have  presented a summary of scenario development processes for SFM.   3.2.2     The Practice  The first step in developing scenarios is to decide on a small number of climate change  scenarios (e.g., two to four) representing a range of plausible climate futures for your SFM  system. There are several ways to create climate change scenarios for the SFM system:   •  Use “off-the-shelf” climate projections for the area encompassing the SFM unit, which  are available from research centers such as the Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium  and Ouranos. The Canadian Forest Service and some provincial and territorial forest  services have significant resources available to project climate changes and impacts  on forests (see the description of the Canadian Forest Service’s Forest Change  initiative, in section 2.3.2).    •  Involve analysts who can work with the available datasets of climate change  projections to create information for the SFM area.   •  Include climate experts on the assessment project team to explore and expand on  the available data.   Efforts should be made to align the timeframes for reporting within the climate change  scenarios with the timeframes for assessing SFM impacts. The following two approaches  have been used in practice:    (1)  Assess a short-term and a long-term timeframe (e.g., 20 years, using the climate  change results for the 2020s, and the end of the century, using results for the  2080s).   (2)  Assess at one midterm timeframe, often the 2050s (i.e., 2041–2070), which is  consistent with the timescale used for reporting midrange climate change  projection results.   From the assessment  framework…  “The first step in developing    these forest impact scenarios ...   is to select climate scenarios   representing a range of plausible   climate futures for the region of   interest. Each climate scenario   necessarily includes projections   of selected climatic variables that   affect forest ecosystems.”  —Williamson et al. (2012)  Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Managment in Canada:    38  Chapter 3 A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making    Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Management in Canada:  A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making Chapter 3  39  Worksheet 3.1  (Develop and describe future climate scenarios) provides a template  for describing important climate conditions for three scenarios. You might select more  scenarios, but as a general rule the analysis should have a minimum of three scenarios,  one of which might be current climate (as a “status quo” scenario).   It is suggested that scenarios be described by simple names, such as low, moderate,  and high change to represent an exploration of differences in the rate of change (e.g.,  the change in mean annual temperature). You may choose to explore differences in  combinations of temperature and precipitation change (such as warmer and wetter,  warmer and drier) or combinations reflecting different rates of change in temperature and  precipitation (such as faster warming over time; slower warming over time).  Confidence and Uncertainty  Uncertainties have always been a factor in forest management decisions in Canada, in part because of the long  lifespan of the country’s common tree species. The pace and scale of climate change simply increases the scope and  implications of these uncertainties.   The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (Parry et al. 2007) defined uncertainty as “an expression of the  degree to which a value (e.g., the future state of the climate system) is unknown.” Uncertainty can result from lack of  information or from disagreement about what is known or even knowable. Uncertainty is a reality in vulnerability  assessments, given that no one knows exactly how the climate may change or how ecological, infrastructure, or  human systems will respond to change in a particular location (Glick et al. 2011).  Vulnerability assessments aim to understand and manage, rather than overcome, as much of the full range of  uncertainty related to climate change as is practicable. At the end of the assessment, uncertainty may appear  to have expanded, but this impression may relate largely to a better understanding of the underlying factors  (Parry et al. 2007). In the case of vulnerability assessment of SFM, it is likely that the nature of the SFM system—its  components and the types of interactions among them—will be better understood.   Explicitly characterizing the level of confidence in a specific information source and in assessment outcomes  clarifies where uncertainties are greatest.  However, when it comes to future climate change scenarios, remember  that “all models are wrong” and that the “outlier” may be the most accurate.  Despite uncertainties about the timing and magnitude of climate change, several authors (Lemmen et al. 2008;  Glick et al. 2011; Peterson et al. 2011) have concluded that sufficient information exists to begin to adapt—we  need not be paralyzed by lingering uncertainties. Opportunity now exists to explore these uncertainties in a  structured manner, such as suggested within this guidebook, and to proactively mainstream adaptation into forest  management plans, practices, and institutions.   For more information on uncertainty and vulnerability assessment, see chapter V, “Addressing uncertainty in  vulnerability assessments,” in Glick et al. (2011).     A basic approach Use the practitioner and local knowledge existing within your assessment team to describe  a range of possible climate scenarios for the future. You may want to focus on the same  change in climate (e.g., warmer and drier) over time, with variation in the degree or rate of  change over time (e.g., minor change, moderate change, large change). Alternatively, you  may want to look at a range of potential changes in climate (e.g., warmer and drier, warmer  and wetter). The scenarios you choose should be relevant to your local or regional area. The  idea is not to be predictive in your estimates of change but to describe a range of future  climates. You will assess the sensitivity of SFM objectives to these changes in chapter 4.  A comprehensive  approach  Include a climate expert on the project team, who will prepare locally focused climate  change projections and information. Expand the climate variables in the projections  beyond temperature and precipitation to include factors that participants identify as being  important to SFM, such as wind speed, frequency of freeze–thaw cycles, changes in seasonal  temperature and precipitation, fire weather index (FWIa) values, and climate moisture index  (CMIb).  Operational  considerations    Seasonal conditions are crucial to operational decisions, making it important to report  seasonal as well as annual projections. If possible, include in the climate scenarios seasonal  climate variables that affect operational decisions.   Strategic considerations  It is essential to encourage reasonable expectations about the certainty of future climate  change projections. Some participants may expect to receive detailed projections for  localized situations (e.g., a community forest area) and others may be discouraged by what  they perceive as large uncertainties in the projections. In either case, it is important to  remind participants that the purpose of the assessment is to explore what could happen if  any of the projected range of climates were to occur in the future.  a For information on the Fire Weather Index (FWI) see http://cwfis.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/background/summary/fwi. Many provincial and territorial departments  responsible for wildfires maintain FWI data records.  b The Climate Moisture Index (CMI) was originally described by Hogg (1994, 1997) as a method for assessing differences in moisture regimes using simple  climate data (temperature and precipitation).  Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Managment in Canada:    40  Chapter 3 A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making    Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Management in Canada:  A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making Chapter 3  41  3.3 Develop and Describe Forest Impact Scenarios  3.3.1     The Theory  Forest ecosystems are sensitive to climate and will be affected, both directly and indirectly,  by changes in temperature, precipitation, and frequency of extreme weather and weather- related events (e.g., droughts, floods, wildfires, pest outbreaks, tree diseases). Potential  forest impacts will depend on the extent of climate change (i.e., exposure) and the  sensitivity of the forest to such change. Additionally, forest ecosystems are complex and  consist of many interactions and feedbacks that make it difficult to predict the impacts  of future climate change, particularly given the uncertainty in the rate and amount of  future climate change. One approach to dealing with this uncertainty is to develop a  range of potential forest impacts based on multiple future climate scenarios (see sidebar  Confidence and Uncertainty).  Williamson et al. (2008) summarized the potential impacts of climate change on Canada’s  forests and forest ecosystems at a broad scale. However, for many SFM vulnerability  assessments, a finer-scale analysis of climate change impacts on forests may be required.  The scientific literature is rich with information about the impacts of climate change on  forest ecosystems. Also, numerous modeling approaches and tools are available that can  be used to estimate climate change impacts on forests.   Many of the vulnerability assessment case studies highlighted by Johnston and Edwards  (2013) used both detailed modeling efforts and forest impact scenarios generated by local  forest practitioners to develop a range of potential impacts to different future climates.  Halofsky et al. (2011) and Swanston et al. (2011) have also provided relevant examples of  how to develop forest ecosystem impact scenarios for use in vulnerability assessment.  3.3.2.     The Practice  Use Worksheet 3.2 (Develop and describe forest impact scenarios) to record  the range of potential impacts on forests, given the climate scenarios developed in  Worksheet 3.1 (Develop and describe future climate scenarios).  Potential forest impacts will depend on the extent of climate change (i.e., exposure) and  the sensitivity of the forest that is affected by climate change. Williamson et al. (2008,  Figure 2) outlined a method to map the potential impacts of climate change on forests.  Additionally, the Canadian Forest Service’s Forest Change initiative (described in section  2.3.2) is producing knowledge products and tools related to forest impacts from climate  change across Canada. These knowledge products and tools are being developed with  forest practitioners in mind, with the goal of assisting them in developing forest impact  scenarios. Many provincial forest services, climate consortiums (e.g., Pacific Climate  Impacts Consortium, Ouranos, ClimateWNA), and universities also have forest impact  modeling resources available for forest practitioners to use when considering climate  change. Use these products in conjunction with practitioner knowledge and expert  opinion to develop scenarios of forest impacts. You may also wish to consult or partner  with academic researchers to investigate potential climate change–related forest impacts.  From the assessment  framework…  “The second step in developing   forest impact scenarios is to   evaluate the response of forests   and forest ecosystems to each   climate scenario (i.e., the climate   change impacts). This response   (i.e., the effects on the forest) will   be a function of the magnitude   of the change in climate under a   particular scenario (i.e., exposure)   combined with the degree to   which the forests are able to   tolerate or adapt to the    degree of change in climate    under a particular scenario    (i.e., sensitivity).”  —Williamson et al. (2012)    Chapter 3 Completion Check-in  Has the assessment team:       Selected and described future climate scenarios?     Created forest impact scenarios and an overall   forest impact ranking for each scenario?     Added to the list of uncertainties and knowledge gaps?     Documented all information sources?  A basic approach Use the practitioner and local knowledge existing within your assessment team to describe  a range of possible forest impact scenarios based on the climate scenarios developed in  chapter 2. The scenarios you choose should be relevant to your local or regional area. The  idea is not to be predictive in your estimates of change but rather to describe a range of  possible futures.   A comprehensive  approach  A more comprehensive approach would be to include on the vulnerability assessment team  a number of forest resource and modeling experts who can examine a range of potential  climate change impacts on the forests within the SFM area of interest and beyond. The  use of multiple forest impact models combined with tacit or expert knowledge is a useful  method for exploring potential future forest conditions.  Operational  considerations    The impacts of climate change on forests may have implications for forestry operations.  Such implications may include reduced access to forest resources (e.g., shorter winter  road conditions), increased salvage operations, reduced timber or fiber quality for mills, or  reduced tree-regeneration success. Consider forest planning, harvesting, and regeneration  practices when developing forest impact scenarios.  Strategic considerations  Keep in mind that no model or expert can accurately predict the future climate and forest  conditions in that climate. Exploring a range of possible futures is a method for developing  management options that are robust across a range of future forest conditions. Changes  to forests and forest conditions in the future may present new opportunities for the SFM  system of interest. It is therefore important to consider potential positive impacts of climate  change as well.  Several technical aspects should be considered in the creation of forest impact scenarios.  The amount of scientific analysis and modeling required will often depend on how  much information (data) exists for the SFM area of interest, the availability of resources to  model forest ecosystems and their responses to changes in climate, and the degree of  “evidence” required for making decisions. Keep in mind that scenarios are not predictions,  but possible futures; therefore, possible future forest impact scenarios can be developed  simply through discussion with colleagues, detailed models, or a combination of the two.   The forest impact scenarios developed here will be used in the next step of the  assessment to assess the consequences of these impacts on the ability to achieve SFM  objectives.

Assess current and future impacts on SFM       Assess current and future vulnerability       Evaluate adaptive capacity of the SFM system       Assess overall SFM system vulnerability       Decision point: Is adaptation required?    4.1 Overview   This chapter provides guidance on evaluating and documenting SFM vulnerability to  current climate (and climate variability) and the range of future climate change scenarios.  Vulnerability is “the degree to which a system is susceptible to, and unable to cope with,  adverse effects of climate change, including climate variability and extremes” (Parry et al.  2007). This chapter is structured around five worksheets that are designed to facilitate a  detailed assessment of both current and future vulnerability of the SFM system:   Worksheet 4.1.  Assess current and future impacts on SFM  Worksheet 4.2.  Evaluate adaptive capacity of the SFM system  Worksheet 4.3.  Assess current and future vulnerability  Worksheet 4.4.  Assess overall SFM system vulnerability  Worksheet 4.5.  Decision point: Is adaptation required?  From the assessment  framework…  “The first part of assessing the   vulnerability of SFM to current   and future climate is to consider   how the analysis of current   climate and forest conditions ...   and the forest impact scenarios   ... might affect each of the SFM   criteria [and objectives]. The   impacts on SFM criteria [and   objectives] should be assessed   for current climate and for   each of the future climate and   forest impact scenarios... The   second part of assessing SFM   vulnerability is to determine   the current adaptive capacity   of the forest management   organizations of interest or the   SFM system.”  —Williamson et al. (2012)  Purpose of “assessing vulnerability” Outcomes  To evaluate and document vulnerability to  current climate conditions and a range of  future forest impact scenarios    •   Description of the current impacts  and the range of potential future  forest impacts on achievement of SFM  objectives  •   Improved understanding of the degree  to which the biophysical and human  elements of your SFM system may  be susceptible to, or unable to cope  with, potential future effects of climate  change   •   Improved understanding and updated  list of the uncertainties and knowledge  gaps related to vulnerability of the SFM  system to future climate   4.2  Assess Impacts on SFM  4.2.1     The Theory  Impacts on forest conditions and processes due to climate change will likely affect forest  managers’ abilities to achieve SFM objectives as currently defined (Ogden and Innes 2007).  Understanding how SFM objectives might be affected by these changes is critical in  assessing the vulnerability of the objectives to climate change. Therefore, the ability of the  SFM system to adapt to current and potential climate change impacts should be assessed.  Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Managment in Canada:    46  Chapter 4 A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making    Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Management in Canada:  A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making Chapter 4  47  SFM Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment  Exposure  Potential   Impacts  Sensitivity  Adaptive  Capacity  Vulnerability  Definitions  Exposure – The degree to which the SFM system is exposed to significant  climatic variations, and the nature of that exposure, including both physical  climate changes (e.g., temperature and precipitation) and resulting climate  conditions (e.g., droughts, altered fire regimes, freeze–thaw cycles).   Sensitivity – The degree to which all elements of the SFM system are  affected, either adversely or beneficially, by climate-related stimuli.  Sensitivity may depend on innate physiological or biological variables,  physical or ecological factors, or the existence and extent of other stressors  (e.g., habitat fragmentation or economic downturn).   Potential impacts – The effects of climate change on the ability to achieve  SFM objectives.  Adaptive capacity – The ability of the human elements of the SFM system  to adjust to climate change (including climate variability and extremes) to  moderate potential effects, to take advantage of opportunities, or to cope  with the consequences.   Vulnerability – The degree to which the SFM system is susceptible to,  or unable to cope with, adverse effects of climate change, including  climate variability and extremes, resulting in challenges to achieving SFM  objectives.   4.2.2     The Practice  The ability to achieve SFM objectives in the future will be affected by the projected  impacts of climate change on forest ecosystems. Using the forest impact scenarios  developed using Worksheet 3.2 (Develop and describe forest impact scenarios)  and the best available information (studies, expert judgments, datasets, model outputs,  etc.), assess the expected impact of climate and climate change on the ability to achieve  SFM objectives. Record your assessments in Worksheet 4.1 (Assess current and future  impacts on SFM). Impacts on the SFM objectives will depend on the degree of projected  forest change and the sensitivity of the objectives to this change (e.g., the ability to  maintain rare habitat on a land base is quite sensitive to changes in forest conditions  resulting from climate change).    A basic approach Brainstorm with your colleagues to complete the worksheets. If possible, have a forestry  climate change specialist review your findings.  A comprehensive  approach  For each SFM objective, or for logical groupings of objectives (e.g., biological diversity  and ecosystem function and productivity), organize focus groups of scientists, technical  specialists, practitioners, and policy specialists with expertise related to the objective.  Facilitate a workshop with each group to complete the worksheet, based largely on the  findings in Worksheet 3.2 (Develop and describe forest impact scenarios). Summarize  the findings for review by all participants, particularly those who will be responsible for  future decision making and/or implementation.   Operational  considerations    Involve forest practitioners in the assessment process to gain an “on-the-ground” perspective  about how changes in climate and forest conditions may affect the ability to achieve SFM  objectives.  Strategic considerations  When assessing climate change impacts, it is essential to consider nonclimatic factors, such  as markets, jobs, and societal values. These are often strategic-scale factors that should be  brought into the assessment. Refer to the driver papers from the Future Forests Project  (http://www.sfmn.ales.ualberta.ca/en/Research/ForestFutures/ForestFuturesDocuments. aspx) for factors that you might consider in your assessment.  4.3 Evaluate Adaptive Capacity of the SFM System  4.3.1     The Theory  Definition of Adaptive Capacity  Adaptive capacity has been defined as “the ability of a system to adjust to climate change  (including climate variability and extremes) to moderate potential damages, to take  advantage of opportunities, or to cope with the consequences” (Parry et al. 2007) (see  sidebar Climate change adaptation and adaptive capacity). Adaptive capacity can  moderate impacts to reduce the vulnerability of a system to climate change.   Adaptive capacity is a crucial element of climate change vulnerability assessment. A  system with high adaptive capacity can identify adaptation requirements and implement  adaptation actions to reduce its vulnerability to climate change and to nonclimatic  stressors and to take action on opportunities.   Assessment of Adaptive Capacity   Assessment of adaptive capacity remains one of the more challenging aspects of  vulnerability analysis. The measurement and analysis of adaptive capacity is a relatively  new and evolving area of study in general and a new area of consideration in forestry- related assessments. The relevance of “adaptive capacity” in the day-to-day operations  of Canadian SFM systems is increasing, in part because management environments  are becoming more complex, uncertainty is increasing, and the pace of changes   Climate Change  Adaptation and  Adaptive Capacity  In a climate change  vulnerability assessment,  adaptive capacity and  adaptation are not  equivalent.  Adaptation describes the  action taken to reduce  negative impacts related  to climate change and to  increase the magnitude  and likelihood of positive  impacts (e.g., research and  training to learn more about  climate change).   Adaptive capacity is the  condition of the system  being assessed (e.g., low  awareness of climate  change or limited financial  resources).  Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Managment in Canada:    48  Chapter 4 A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making    Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Management in Canada:  A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making Chapter 4  49  affecting forest management seems to be rising (see Case Study – “National assessment  of adaptive capacity and sustainable forest management”). The combined effect is  increasing recognition of the need to be adaptive and to understand and develop the  system’s inherent capacity to adapt. Adaptive capacity can be assessed a number of  ways. Williamson and Isaac (2013) summarized the current literature on adaptive capacity  relevant to SFM and presented a framework of the dimensions of adaptive capacity along  with relevant assessment approaches.  Case Study - National  assessment of adaptive  capacity and sustainable  forest management  Based largely on insights from extensive discussions and interviews with Canadian forest  managers and other practitioners, Johnston et al. (2010) reported the following key  findings:      •  Awareness of the issue and perception of urgency – Awareness of climate change  as an important issue for forest management is increasing in Canada, although site- specific impacts and adaptation options are not yet well understood.       •  Range of technological options available to decision makers – The availability of  technological options for adaptation is variable, and cost is often a limiting factor.       •  Economic resources – Investment in innovation in the Canadian forest sector is  generally low, which limits the ability to develop innovative solutions to address  climate change impacts. In addition, resources are often lacking to support  vulnerability assessments and adaptation planning.       •  Institutional factors (e.g., design and structure, flexibility, ability to efficiently  allocate resources to adaptation, degree of autonomy in making adaptation choices)  – Institutional barriers are an important limitation to implementing adaptation  options. Analyses of current policy could help in identifying features likely to hinder  adaptation. Canadian forest management has a number of institutions that increase  adaptive capacity (e.g., Forest Products Association of Canada, the model forest  network, forest certification programs, the national forest strategy, and professional  associations).      •  Human and social capital of adaptors (e.g., skills, education, experience, networks)  – Although the adaptive capacity of the forestry profession is generally high, a lack of  scientific capacity is an important constraint to planning for climate change. In some  locations, the lack of human capacity is seen as a constraint.      •  Knowledge and access to information – Research capacity related to forest  management is high in Canada, but to date researchers have not addressed climate  change comprehensively. Also, there is a lack of scientific capacity relative to  understanding and dealing with climate change in the Canadian forest sector, and  a lack of information at spatial and temporal scales relevant to forest management  planning and decision making. New modeling tools will assist in developing a  better understanding of the impacts of climate change and the role of potential  management interventions in adaptation activities.      •  Ability to manage risk – Forestry companies, like any other type of business, engage  in risk management as part of normal business practice. However, some aspects of  forest management, such as long-term commitments favoring certain tree species  during reforestation, make risk management more difficult.     Case Study - Kamloops  Future Forest Strategy  The Kamloops Future Forest Strategy emphasized “management adaptive capacity” in a  vulnerability assessment for a forest area of 2.7 million hectares in central British Columbia.  Management adaptive capacity was defined as encompassing current legislation, policies,  administrative structures, and other factors that shape the way forest management functions  in the area, including its influence on the management actions that forest managers are willing  and/or able to implement.    Following the identification of possible management actions to reduce the sensitivity of  ecosystems, adaptive capacity was considered by evaluating barriers to implementation. The  following five broad themes or general barriers emerged:   (1) lack of a comprehensive strategic planning process   (2) more costly reforestation   (3) more costly or break-even harvesting   (4) need for ongoing stand management (e.g., beyond free growing)   (5) requirement for government to take on increased management risk.   Source: Details on the Kamloops Future Forest Strategy can be found at   http://k2project.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/kamloops-future-forest-strategy-june25-09.pdf  4.3.2     The Practice  Adaptive capacity assessments rely largely on interviews, discussions, and surveys  during which individual practitioners and policy specialists share their views about their  individual and collective adaptive capacity, based on a list of assets or determinants taken  from the literature. Assessment of adaptive capacity is highly contextual and details of  the assessment will vary depending on the focus of the assessment (see “Case study –  Kamloops Future Forest Strategy”).  Worksheet 4.2 (Evaluate adaptive capacity of the SFM system) provides guidance  on assessing adaptive capacity characteristics, based on the framework proposed by  Williamson and Isaac (2013). The worksheet consists of a series of questions that users can  ask themselves and their organizations to help understand their capacity to adapt both  generally and specifically in relation to climate change.    4.4 Assess Current and Future SFM Vulnerability  4.4.1     The Theory  According to the IPCC, vulnerability “is a function of the character, magnitude, and rate of  climate change and variation to which a system is exposed, its sensitivity, and its adaptive  capacity” (Parry et al. 2007). Systems that experience relatively low level of impacts, either  because they are not exposed to significant climate changes or variability or because they  are insensitive to these changes (or a combination of these factors) have low vulnerability.  Where there is potential for large impacts on a system because of high exposure or high  sensitivity (or both), high adaptive capacity can reduce the degree to which the system  is vulnerable. However, in cases where an impact critically affects the ability to meet   Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Managment in Canada:    50  Chapter 4 A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making    Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Management in Canada:  A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making Chapter 4  51  objectives and there is no potential adaptive capacity, the system has high vulnerability.  A high level of vulnerability may lead to significant adverse effects on natural and human  systems.   The outcomes of a vulnerability assessment consist of relative vulnerability rankings and  a documented understanding of the specific factors contributing to this vulnerability.  Glick et al. (2011) emphasized that a vulnerability assessment is not an end point; rather,  it is a source of information to be incorporated into planning and decision making. They  described vulnerability rankings as an intermediate step, used in setting management and  planning priorities and crafting adaptation options, including monitoring and allocating  scarce resources.   4.4.2     The Practice  Assessing the vulnerability of SFM objectives is a subjective practice based on the best  available information and knowledge of potential impacts on the objectives and the  assessment of general adaptive capacity. There is no exact science for this process, and it  is best to work in a group or to conduct a workshop to estimate the vulnerability of your  SFM objectives.  Worksheet 4.3 (Assess current and future vulnerability) combines the impacts on  SFM objectives determined in Worksheet 4.1 (Assess current and future impacts on  SFM) and the assessment of adaptive capacity from Worksheet 4.2 (Evaluate adaptive  capacity of the SFM system) to determine the vulnerability of SFM objectives under  current forest conditions and future forest impact scenarios. For example, if the impacts of  climate change on achieving a specific SFM objective are ranked as high and the adaptive  capacity of the system for this objective is ranked as low, vulnerability would be ranked as  high.   It is also useful to step back from the level of individual SFM objectives and examine the  SFM system as a whole, considering the question, “Under current forest conditions and  the range of potential future climate and forest impacts, is the SFM system vulnerable  to climate change?” Use Worksheet 4.4 (Assess overall SFM system vulnerability) to  summarize your conclusions.  4.5 Decision Point: Is Adaptation Required?  At this stage, the detailed vulnerability assessment is now complete. You should have  a good indication of what aspects of the SFM system and its objectives are vulnerable  to climate change. If vulnerabilities exist, it is now time to identify adaptation options  (chapter 5) and put those options into practice (chapter 6). Conversely, if the SFM system  is sound and no vulnerabilities have been identified, you should continue to monitor the  system and reassess vulnerability as new knowledge, learning, or insights are gained (see  figure 4 in Williamson et al. [2012]). Use Worksheet 4.5 (Decision point: Is adaptation  required?) to record your determination of whether adaptation is required on the basis of  the vulnerability assessment.    Chapter 4 Completion Check-in  Has the assessment team:       Assessed the effects of current and potential future forest impacts on the ability to  achieve the SFM objectives?    Assessed the adaptive capacity of the SFM system?     Assessed current and future vulnerability according to SFM impacts and adaptive  capacity?    Updated the list of uncertainties and knowledge gaps?    Documented all information sources?  4.6  Literature Cited  Glick, P.; Stein, B.A.; Edelson, N.A., editors. 2011.

It includes two worksheets designed to facilitate this assessment:  Worksheet 5.1.  Develop potential adaptation options for SFM objectives    Worksheet 5.2.   Develop potential adaptation options for the overall SFM system of  interest  From the assessment  framework…  “If it is determined that   adaptation is required, it is then   necessary to identify options. The   identification of these options or   their subsequent modification   will depend on the types and   magnitudes of SFM vulnerability   identified in [chapter] 4. Some   adaptation options will reduce   the potential negative impacts   or increase the potential positive   impacts, whereas others will   enhance adaptive capacity   or reduce adaptive capacity   deficits.“  —Williamson et al. (2012)  Purpose of “assessing vulnerability” Outcomes  To develop a suite of adaptation options  for the SFM system of interest and to  assess the importance of each option for  achieving SFM objectives  •   A list of possible adaptation options for  each of the CCFM SFM criteria and for  the overall SFM system of interest or, if  you are reassessing adaptation options,  a list of modified adaptation options  •   An assessment of the importance of  adaptation options for achieving SFM  objectives and for the overall SFM  system of interest under the range of  climate change scenarios that you have  defined   5.2 Develop Potential Adaptation Options  5.2.1     The Theory  Once key current and future vulnerabilities have been identified, the next step is to  formulate a list of adaptation options. There is little theory available on the development  of adaptation options (see “Case study –Capabilities approach to identifying adaptation  options” for one approach). The key is to develop as wide a range of options as possible,  given the scenarios developed earlier in the vulnerability assessment process. The  adaptation options can focus on a range of policy, practice, or capacity changes. The  options will be prioritized and the feasibility of implementing them assessed in chapter 6.   5.2.2     The Practice  An inventory of adaptation options was compiled to aid in the development of this  guidebook (see Appendix 5). This inventory was based on a review of the literature  (drawn largely from Ogden and Innes 2007 and Innes et al. 2009) to identify adaptation  options previously suggested by researchers as ways of incorporating climate change  considerations into forest management and planning.   Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Managment in Canada:    54  Chapter 5 A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making    Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Management in Canada:  A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making Chapter 5  55  Case Study – Capabilities  approach to identifying  adaptation options  Alberta’s Climate Change Adaptation Framework Manual (ESRD 2010) uses a capabilities  approach to identify adaptation options. The premise behind this approach is that an  organization’s capabilities for adaptation depend on options in four critical areas, each of  which should be considered when developing a list of potential adaptation options:  •   Governance – These options address management, policies, and processes to direct  the organization’s activities and cover policy, resource decisions, and facilitation of cross- organization relationships.  •   People – These options improve the capacity and capabilities of individuals within  the organization and also look beyond the organization to external stakeholders  through training, recruitment and retention strategies, updated job descriptions, and  performance management.  •   Technology – These options involve the application of science for adaptation to the  environment, such as climate modeling software, geographic information systems, field  equipment, monitoring equipment, and infrastructure.  •   Process – These options address how work is done within the organization. Processes  for climate change adaptation include developing and deploying strategies, identifying  and assessing risks, responding to risks, designing and testing measures, monitoring and  re-evaluating progress, and continuous improvement.  The field of forest management adaptation is rapidly evolving, and this inventory of  adaptation options should therefore not be considered definitive or comprehensive;  rather, it should be revised and updated as new knowledge is gained or as innovative  ideas are proposed. The inventory of potential adaptation options and the worksheets  associated with this step are categorized according to relevant CCFM SFM criteria.     In addition to these suggestions and any that have been collected during the vulnerability  assessment process, the assessment team should also explicitly consider options to  strengthen adaptive capacity to achieve each of the SFM objectives. The team should  revisit the adaptive capacity assessment (Worksheet 4.2. Evaluate adaptive capacity  of the SFM system) and identify adaptive capacity deficits that are specific to achieving  individual SFM objectives. For example, a knowledge deficit that can be filled by ongoing  support from a climate specialist through analysis of future extreme rainfall to understand  potential impacts on soil erosion could be recorded as an adaptation option under  your SFM objective related to maintaining soil productivity. Referring back to the key  uncertainties and knowledge gaps identified throughout the vulnerability assessment  process (Worksheet 2.4. Identify uncertainties and knowledge gaps) can also be a  great starting point for generating adaptation options.  Worksheet 5.1 (Develop potential adaptation options for SFM objectives) involves  identifying all potential adaptation options for your SFM system of interest. At this stage,  adaptation options should not be evaluated; rather, efforts should be directed toward  identifying all possible options.       A basic approach Gather a group of interested parties to review the adaptation options listed in Appendix 5  (the inventory of potential adaptation options) and to brainstorm additional options to add  to the list. You may also use the knowledge gaps and uncertainties identified throughout  the vulnerability assessment as a starting point. Engaging with others who are working on  vulnerability assessment of SFM may also be useful; for example, see the Forestry Adaptation  Community of Practice <http://www.ccadaptation.ca/facop>.   A comprehensive  approach  A more comprehensive approach might include a review of the relevant literature, keeping  in mind that adaptation is a “local” activity and that adaptations identified in the literature  may not fit with the specific ecological or institutional context of your assessment area.  Another approach to eliciting adaptation options is to conduct the first round of a Policy  Delphi process (see, for example, http://www.climateontario.ca/LakeSimcoeDelphi.php).   Operational  considerations    What options exist for adapting forest management policies and practices to reduce  vulnerability to climate change? When identifying potential adaptation options, keep the  following guidance in mind  •   Be creative and innovative. Climate change adaptation is a newly expanding area, and not  all options are on the table yet.   •   Encourage the identification of new approaches to adaptation by brainstorming. Don’t  evaluate options at this stage, because doing so can limit creativity.  •   Engage a variety of perspectives in this process, and consider a broad range of potential  management intensities and viewpoints.  Strategic considerations  Keep in mind that the ultimate goal of adaptation planning is to reduce vulnerability to  climate change and thereby increase the likelihood that management objectives will be  achieved. Because of the profound uncertainties associated with many of the adaptation  options, it may be important to build flexibility and “learning by doing” into your list of  adaptation options.  Some of the identified impacts may be cross-cutting, influencing several or all of the SFM  objectives (e.g., lack of awareness of climate change impacts among senior managers is  likely to affect many objectives). A separate worksheet (Worksheet 5.2. Develop potential  adaptation options for the overall SFM system of interest) is provided to develop and  assess options with a view to reducing cross-cutting impacts on the SFM system.  Changing current policies, practices, and strategies (i.e., adapting) to reduce climate  change vulnerabilities can focus on many areas of forest management. Two good places  to start are developing options to address potential impacts on forests and to increase  adaptive capacity.  Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Managment in Canada:    56  Chapter 5 A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making    Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Management in Canada:  A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making Chapter 5  57  From the assessment  framework…  “Once a suite of potential   adaptations has been identified,   the next step is to assess them   and select those that have    the greatest potential benefit    for SFM or that offer the    greatest promise in terms of   achieving SFM (however it is   defined for the management   system of interest), given the   realities of climate change.”  —Williamson et al. (2012)  5.3 Identify Important Options for Achieving SFM  5.3.1     The Theory  Once a suite of potential adaptation options has been identified, the next step is to  assess and select those adaptations that have the greatest benefits for SFM or that offer  the greatest promise in terms of achieving SFM objectives. It is essential to focus on the  importance of implementing adaptation options at this stage in the adaptation process  and not on the feasibility of implementing the adaptations. Assessing feasibility and  ecological and social suitability will be addressed in chapter 6.  Options that support achievement of SFM objectives across the range of possible future  scenarios are known as “robust” options. Other categories of important options are “no- regret,” “win–win,” and “must-do” options. No-regret options make sense today and for  all potential futures. For example, increasing awareness of climate change and climate  change impacts within your organization is likely to be a no-regret option, and very  little will be lost if the projected climate change and impacts do not materialize. Win– win options are those that can reduce vulnerability to climate change while improving  or positively affecting other priorities. For example, the use of assisted migration to  incorporate new tree species may present the opportunity to use tree species that are  more productive, which could (hypothetically) lead to increased carbon capture. Must-do  options are those that ought to be  undertaken immediately to achieve SFM objectives  under current climate conditions and regardless of projected future climates.   5.3.2     The Practice  Guidance for completing the option assessment steps in Worksheet 5.1 (Develop  potential adaptation options for SFM objectives) and Worksheet 5.2 (Develop  potential adaptation options for the overall SFM system of interest) is provided  below.  Importance of implementing adaption option to achieve management objectives  – A good starting point for climate change adaptation in the forest sector is to proactively  identify management policies and practices with a higher likelihood of achieving SFM  objectives across a wide range of potential climate futures (see “Case study – Southwest  Yukon”). Considering climate change vulnerabilities, how important (or beneficial) is it to  implement each of the adaptation options to achieve management objectives in your  area? Perform this assessment both for current climate conditions and for each of the  scenarios you have described.   “Important” adaptation options – Determine which adaptation options can be  considered robust, no-regret, win–win, and/or must-do (i.e., options that are important to  implement across all scenarios to achieve management objectives in your area and thus  most beneficial for SFM). In identifying these “important” adaptation options, look for any  that are considered by a diverse group of practitioners or stakeholders as important to     A basic approach Evaluate adaptation options using best available information (studies, expert judgment,  datasets, model outputs, etc.). Instead of seeking consensus on a single ranking, you may  wish to provide a range of rankings from various sources.    A comprehensive  approach  Gather a diverse group, including planners, individuals responsible for implementing  adaptation actions, representatives of interest groups, and policy makers, to evaluate the list of  adaptation options.  Operational  considerations    Given that every forest area has its own unique combination of ecological, economic, social,  and cultural conditions, there is no single right approach to adaptation. Instead, options  should be evaluated for specific areas and timeframes, to determine when and where  various adaptation options should be implemented.  Strategic considerations  Don’t become overwhelmed by a lack of data or by low confidence in the information  available for many of these decisions. Use the information that is available, but also plan to  rely on expert judgments and/or the informed judgments of local forest practitioners (see  sidebar Informed judgements). Do your best to identify “important” adaptations that are  likely to do reasonably well over a wide range of potential future conditions.  implement across a wide range of possible future scenarios. Also identify any options that  could enhance flexibility in policies and practices given an uncertain future. These could  also be considered important options.  “Not-important” adaptation options – Some options may not be ranked as important  for achieving SFM objectives under a changing climate. Although you may not wish to  consider these options for the remaining assessment steps, it is wise to keep them on  your list of potential adaptation options for use as a starting point for future reassessment  of vulnerability. In addition, although these options may not be ranked as important  for addressing climate change, they may represent important views and opinions of  interested parties that can be addressed through other planning processes.  Case Study – Southwest  Yukon  A good starting point for climate change adaptation in the forest sector is to proactively  identify policies and practices with a higher likelihood of achieving management  objectives across a wide range of potential climate futures. This step should be followed by  implementation of these options and monitoring of their success in achieving objectives  within an adaptive management context.  A study in southwest Yukon identified locally appropriate adaptation options by tapping  into the experiential knowledge base of local forest practitioners while concurrently building  capacity within this community to implement the options. Thirty forest practitioners  involved with implementation of a regional forest management plan were engaged in  identifying climate change vulnerabilities and evaluating alternative adaptation options.  A structured decision-making approach was used to frame the assessment. Practitioners  identified 24 adaptation options that they considered important to implement for achieving  the regional goals and objectives of SFM in light of climate change.

In addition, expert judgments (generally defined as those of well-recognized researchers)  have been used to forecast and assess probabilities and risks and have provided useful insights for decision  makers, particularly in situations characterized by complexity and deep uncertainty. Although some efforts have  been made to document the judgments of members of the professional and practitioner communities on matters  related to climate change, research in this area has received considerably less attention. A notable gap is research to  document the informed judgments of forest practitioners on priorities and mechanisms for adaptation.    It may be useful for forest managers to gain experience in developing and evaluating alternative adaptation  options. Integrating considerations related to climate change adaptation into existing decision-making processes  is called “mainstreaming” and can lead to “win–win” policies, i.e., those that reduce vulnerability to climatic change  while simultaneously addressing other priorities. It is also important for key local actors and institutions to be  involved in mainstreaming, because they play significant roles in knowledge transfer and policy development.  Interventions will be more successful if they are identified and developed by local actors, as they (the interventions)  are more likely to be consistent with local priorities, goals, norms, and institutions. Conversely, a recommendation  developed without consultation with local communities and/or government institutions is far less likely to be  adopted.  Forest practitioners play a critical role in adaptation planning. They are involved with the planning and  management of forest-based resources and frequently collaborate with ecological, economic, social, and cultural  experts, as well as holders of local, traditional, and/or scientific knowledge of forest-based resources. Practitioners  are well-informed, highly knowledgeable individuals whose employment or livelihood is tied to the forest sector  and who are typically employed by key decision-making agencies; alternatively, they may be stakeholders who  are instrumental in driving forestry decision making. Documenting the informed judgments of practitioners  could therefore provide useful insights into the state of knowledge and practice on climate adaptation and the  readiness of practitioners to engage in adaptive strategies. The applied knowledge held by forest practitioners can  also provide useful insights for decision makers while research to produce more definitive results is in progress,  particularly in situations characterized by complexity and deep uncertainty (see Walker et al. [2013] for more on  adaptation under deep uncertainty).   Forest practitioners work at the confluence of government, scientific, and community knowledge and priorities  and as such are experts in the local context. They also play an important role in developing, implementing, and/ or reviewing operational forest management plans to ensure that community-directed goals and objectives  of forest management are achieved. Within the experiential knowledge base of local practitioners rests an  applied understanding of local priorities, goals, norms, and institutions. There are many trade-offs involved in  forest management decision making, trade-offs that are well understood by those who are experts in the local  context. This expertise is incredibly useful to an assessment of climate change vulnerabilities and the regional  appropriateness of adaptation options and strategies. An exploration of practitioners’ viewpoints on adaptation  measures in a local context also creates the opportunity to build a collective understanding of locally appropriate  measures that might be taken to adapt to climate change. In addition, raising awareness of the range of alternative  adaptation options within this community can facilitate changes in policy and practice. In this way, exposing  practitioners to adaptation-related questions might help to build the necessary foundation for their incorporation  into longer-term forest management and planning-related decisions.

CHAPTER 6     IMPLEMENTATION AND   MAINSTREAMING OF ADAPTATION    From the assessment  framework…  “Mainstreaming adaptation into   decision making is a continual   process whereby     •  adaptations are assessed in   terms of the degree to which   they are effective;     •  technical feasibility and costs   and benefits are evaluated;     •  adaptations that are feasible   and economically justified are   implemented;     •  the performance of the   adaptations is monitored and   evaluated;     •  the adaptation program and/  or management objectives are   modified, if necessary; and     •  vulnerability is periodically   reassessed as new knowledge,   learning, and insights become   known.”  —Williamson et al. (2012)  6.1 Overview  This chapter provides guidance on implementing and mainstreaming adaptation for SFM.  It is structured around four worksheets that are designed to facilitate mainstreaming of  adaptation into SFM planning and practice:  Worksheet 6.1.  Prioritize adaptation options  Worksheet 6.2.  Recommend priority adaptation options for implementation  Worksheet 6.3.  Implement (mainstream) recommended adaptations  Worksheet 6.4.  Evaluate adaptation performance  Purpose of “implementing and  mainstreaming adaptation”  Outcomes  To support efficient and successful  implementation of adaptation priorities  by mainstreaming selected adaptation  options into existing SFM activities as  much as possible  •   A list of prioritized adaptation options  •   A list of recommended adaptation  options for implementation  •   Integration of implementation planning  into existing SFM processes or creation  of an implementation plan outlining  the human resources, financial  resources, business processes, and  partnerships required for successful  implementation of your adaptation  priorities  •   A plan for continuous evaluation of the  implementation of adaptation actions  and for continuous monitoring of the  SFM system   6.2 Prioritize and Recommend Adaptation Options  6.2.1     The Theory  After “important” adaptation options have been identified, they can be prioritized  and then rejected, postponed, or selected for implementation. Of the many methods  available for prioritizing options, the most useful will depend on the decision-making  context of your SFM system and the actors involved in the vulnerability assessment. One  method for prioritizing adaptation options is a Policy Delphi process (as described in  “Case study – Lake Simcoe” in section 6.2.2), which involves the use of multiple rounds of  expert opinion, solicited through an anonymous process, to generate and refine the list  of potential adaptation options. Conversely, some prioritization may have already been  completed when you assessed the importance of each adaptation option in Worksheet  5.1 (Develop potential adaptation options for SFM objectives) and Worksheet 5.2  (Develop potential adaptation options for the overall SFM system of interest).  Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Managment in Canada:    62  Chapter 6 A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making    Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Management in Canada:  A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making Chapter 6  63  The main consideration throughout the prioritization and recommendation stages is  whether the adaptation helps in achieving SFM objectives across a range of potential  futures.   Information Source Lim and Spanger-Siegfried (2005) identified four main methods for prioritizing adaptation  options:  1.   Cost–benefit analysis – This method uses one criterion—economic efficiency—to  assess and provide an absolute measure of the desirability of alternative adaptation  options. It can identify optimal options and priorities, albeit based on a single criterion.  Cost–benefit analysis has relatively heavy data requirements.  2.   Multicriteria analysis – This method is suitable when more criteria are thought to be  relevant and it is not possible to quantify and evaluate the criteria in monetary terms. It  is typically used to rank options. If a “do-nothing option” is one of the alternatives being  evaluated, a multicriteria analysis can help to clarify whether the adaptation measure is  better than the status quo.  Subjective judgment plays an important role in multicriteria  analysis, making its outcomes more arbitrary than those of cost–benefit analysis.   3.   Cost-effectiveness analysis –This method is a form of economic analysis that compares  the relative costs and outcomes (effects) of two or more courses of action. It is distinct  from cost–benefit analysis, in that it does not assign a monetary value to the measure  of effect. Cost-effectiveness analysis lies somewhere between cost–benefit analysis  and multicriteria analysis in terms of subjectivity; it is similar to multicriteria analysis in  providing only a ranking.  4.   Expert judgment – Expert judgments have been used to forecast and assess  probabilities and risks and have provided useful insights for decision makers, particularly  in situations characterized by complexity and deep uncertainty and where limited  information is available. See box Informed Judgments in chapter 5 for a more detailed  discussion of this approach.   Once the prioritization step is complete, the priority adaptation options should be  assessed for ecological and social suitability and for feasibility of implementation. If the  options are deemed suitable and feasible, the adaptations are “upgraded” from options  to recommendations. Ste-Marie (2014) has summarized the facets to consider when  assessing assisted migration as an adaptation option, but the points presented in that  summary are relevant to any adaptation options being considered.   6.2.2     The Practice  Few forest management adaptation planning processes have reached the stage of  prioritizing adaptation options, so limited guidance is available as to what will work in  various contexts. One recent experience, the Lake Simcoe Vulnerability Assessment, is  described in the case study below.   Case Study – Lake Simcoe The vulnerability assessment for Lake Simcoe, Ontario, involved a Policy Delphi process to  both elicit a wide range of adaptation options and to assess and refine the list of potential  options. The original list developed during the assessment process presented over 900  potential adaptation options. Use of the Delphi process allowed participants to reduce  the number of options to a more feasible number (see http://www.climateontario.ca/ LakeSimcoeDelphi.php).     The first step in Worksheet 6.1 (Prioritize adaptation options) is to describe the process  that will be used to prioritize the options created in chapter 5. This process will likely  depend on the existing decision-making context. The second step is to list the prioritized  adaptation options by SFM objective and describe why these adaptation options are  priorities for implementation.  Worksheet 6.2 (Recommend priority adaptation options for implementation) provides  guidance for assessing and selecting priority adaptation options to be implemented.   Potential barriers and conflicts – For all of the adaptation options selected as having  priority, potential conflicts with implementation must be assessed. This process involves  considering the ecological suitability, social acceptability, and economic and institutional  feasibility of the adaptations. In some cases, feasibility may be limited by identifiable  barriers or constraints to adaptation (see Moser and Ekstrom 2010). For example, the  uncertainty of adaptation success may be too high to justify implementation without  further research. Such constraints should be noted and described, because the preferred  adaptation option in such a case might be to remove or reduce the barriers and  constraints. Infeasibility could also result from the social unacceptability of a potential  adaptation option (e.g., introduction of exotic tree species at a large scale).   If an adaptation option is deemed infeasible, it may be worth determining whether the  option can be changed in a way that would make it feasible. If that possibility exists, then  the adaptation option can be adjusted; otherwise, the adaptation option is rejected and  alternatives should be sought. Priority adaptation options should also be assessed for  conflicts with the achievement of other SFM objectives.   Recommended adaptations – Once it has been determined that a particular  suite of adaptation options will benefit SFM objectives, yield acceptable outcomes,  and be feasible, then the adaptation options can be upgraded from “options” to  “recommendations.” Keep in mind that adaptation options ranked as very important  for achieving an SFM objective in a changing climate may not be the most suitable  or the most feasible options. You may need to weigh the importance, or benefit, of  implementing the option against the ease or difficulty of implementation.   Timeframe for implementation –Determine the timeframe for implementation of the  recommended option. Implementation timeframes may be related to existing opportunities  (e.g., the start of a new forest management planning cycle), the status of the option as  a “must-do” adaptation, the impending disappearance of a funding source to support  the implementation, or other factors. Certain adaptation options may not need to be  implemented immediately but can be delayed until the timing is right.  “Achievability” of SFM objectives  – Keep in mind that it may not be possible to reach  all management objectives through adjustments to forest management policies and  practices. Climate change will likely result in some impacts to forests which, regardless  of the intensity of forest management efforts, will preclude the achievement of certain  objectives. In these cases, the forest management objectives themselves should be  revisited by asking the question, “With implementation of the recommended adaptations,  do we expect to be able to achieve our SFM objectives?” If the answer is “no,” you should  consider either identifying additional adaptations or revising your SFM objectives.   Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Managment in Canada:    64  Chapter 6 A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making    Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Management in Canada:  A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making Chapter 6  65  A basic approach Have the vulnerability assessment team assess the options on the basis of their experience  and knowledge, with the understanding that the team represents only a small proportion of  the interested parties within the SFM system of interest.  A comprehensive  approach  Seek participation of and perspectives from a diverse group of interested parties (e.g.,  stakeholders, public, other government departments) in assessing potential conflicts and  prioritizing adaptations.  Operational  considerations    Individuals responsible for forest planning, harvesting operations, and mill operations should  be included in the assessment of suitability and feasibility. Individuals who work on these  tasks daily often know the details required to implement new approaches and techniques.  This step in the adaptation process can also be an opportunity for all interested parties to  bring forward creative solutions and new opportunities.   Strategic considerations  Don’t become overwhelmed by a lack of data or tremendous uncertainties. Use the  information that is available, but also plan to rely on expert judgments and/or the informed  judgments of local forest practitioners to develop recommendations and priorities. Look for  “no-regret” adaptations (i.e., actions that make sense now and in the future, regardless of  what the climate might be).  From the assessment  framework…  “Adaptation means a   change in the way of doing   business. Implementation   of an adaptation may   therefore require changes in   planning, procedures, policies,   regulations, legislation,   investments, protocols,   guidelines, standards, and   operational methods. However,   implementation does not   encompass any change    in SFM objectives.””  —Williamson et al. (2012)  6.3 Mainstream Adaptation Priorities  6.3.1     The Theory  Now that you have developed a list of adaptation priorities, it is time to transform  them into actions by incorporating them into the day-to-day operations of relevant  organizations. Integrating adaptations into regular business practice is known as  “mainstreaming.” This process also encourages all members of an organization to become  knowledgeable about climate change and its potential impacts.   Fundamentally, adaptation is about doing things differently. Implementation may require  a change in ways of doing business, such as alterations in planning, procedures, policies,  regulations, legislation, investments, protocols, guidelines, training, and operational  methods. The changes may be minor and easily implemented, or they may be more  significant and require careful planning and monitoring. Implementation will require  mobilization of financial and human resources, as well as ongoing, effective partnerships  with agencies and other organizations that may be involved in, or affected by,  implementation of the adaptation measures.  If the individuals who will be responsible for and involved in implementing the  adaptations have been engaged in the earlier stages of vulnerability assessment, they  should already know the reasons why adaptations are needed. If they have not had an  opportunity to learn about climate change impacts or how and why specific adaptations  were chosen, they will need to be brought up to speed, to facilitate their support and  ensure effective implementation of the adaptations. Moser and Ekstrom (2010) have  summarized the barriers to implementation of adaptation options and some options for  overcoming them.     6.3.2     The Practice   Mainstreaming adaptation into day-to-day operations requires integrating priority  adaptations into ongoing planning and operational procedures. This can be accomplished  by developing a mainstreaming plan for each priority adaptation. If appropriate,  individual plans can be combined into a comprehensive mainstreaming plan with  strategic, operational, and adaptive capacity components. Worksheet 6.3 (Implement  [mainstream] recommended adaptations) provides a template to aid you in preparing  your mainstreaming plans. For each recommended adaptation, the follow actions are  suggested:    •  Assess the jurisdiction within which the adaptation actions fall and the roles and  responsibilities of various agencies and individuals in implementation.   •  Identify the actions required to implement the adaptation (e.g., changes in planning,  procedures, policies, regulations, legislation, investments, protocols, guidelines,  training, and operational methods).   •  Identify opportunities to mainstream the adaptation into regular business  processes.   •  Identify roles and responsibilities (i.e., the specific person or department that will  lead implementation and other individuals or departments that should be involved).  Set deadlines for implementation progress.   •  Assess the internal support required for implementation to proceed (e.g.,  operational staff, specialists, senior management, political leaders).    •  Assess the external support required for implementation to proceed (e.g.,  involvement or buy-in from other organizations).   •  Identify the human resources required for implementation to proceed and assess  whether these resources are available or if they must be secured.   •  Assess information and/or training needs that may be required to implement the  adaptation.   •  Identify the financial resources required for implementation to proceed and assess  whether these resources are available or if they must be secured.    •  Describe what successful implementation would look like (e.g., all planning and  operations staff are knowledgeable about climate change impacts and adaptation;  silvicultural operations reflect changes in precipitation).    •  Identify the overall schedule, the timing of specific events, and the milestones  associated with implementation.   •  Determine if there is a need to communicate with decision makers, other staff, or  interested parties about the adaptation and its potential implications.   •  Determine if there is an existing monitoring or tracking plan into which this  adaptation should be incorporated.    •  Consider whether the adaptation can help to achieve other non-SFM objectives or  goals.   Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Managment in Canada:    66  Chapter 6 A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making    Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Management in Canada:  A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making Chapter 6  67  Ideally, the adaptations will be mainstreamed into regular business processes and  included in regular business reviews and improvements over time. If not, consider  creating a separate implementation plan and a team to monitor implementation and  effectiveness. The first tasks of the implementation team should be to review and finalize  the implementation plan and to secure the necessary internal and external support from  key agencies.  A basic approach Integrate the adaptations into your existing strategic plans (e.g., strategic forest  management plan), operational plans (e.g., annual work plan), and day-to-day decisions.  Add the priority adaptations when you update each plan, or undertake a review to identify  whether existing plans should be updated immediately.   A comprehensive  approach  Effective communications and good working relationships will be extremely important to  successful implementation of adaptations. In addition, implementation provides a great  opportunity to work cooperatively and collaboratively with land management partners and  other interested parties. Work with these stakeholders to secure needed resources, identify  business process requirements, prioritize activities, agree on responsibilities, and identify  feasible milestones. Working together to mainstream adaptations will help to create buy-in  and should result in adaptations that are realistic and achievable.  Operational  considerations    To support buy-in and effective implementation, it will be essential to share the reasons for  the adaptations with anyone who will be involved in implementing them (e.g., planners,  government approvals staff, operations personnel, contactors, and forest workers).  Remember that this will take time and resources.   Strategic considerations  Ensure that you have done everything you can to garner support from the various  individuals and organizations that may be affected by the adaptation, both internal  personnel (such as senior managers) and external interests (such as communities and  neighboring land users).  6.4 Evaluate Adaptation Performance  6.4.1     The Theory  Insights and recommendations about management policies and practices gained  by working through the worksheets in this guidebook represent a starting point for  vulnerability assessment and adaptation. Confidence in the feasibility and effectiveness  of some adaptations and in projections for future climate change may be low, so it is  essential that individual adaptations and the entire SFM system be closely monitored  and refined once recommendations for adaptation options have been made (see  Williamson and Edwards 2014). As well, regardless of the acceptability and feasibility  of the recommended adaptation actions, some vulnerability is likely to remain after  implementation. Therefore, monitoring is an essential part of the vulnerability and  adaptation assessment framework. The aim of monitoring is to track whether adaptations  have been implemented, whether SFM objectives are being met under a changing  climate, and whether residual vulnerability necessitates refinement of objectives or  activities.    To be effective, monitoring should be part of a systematic process in which information  gained by monitoring is used to improve decisions, refine practices, or change  management objectives (e.g., adaptive management or continuous improvement).  The monitoring results can help to identify areas where implementation is progressing  and objectives are being met but also areas of concern. For each measure that raises  a concern, adjustments to current practices (e.g., changes to operational practices,  refinements to plans, enhanced research) should be identified and implemented. If SFM  is not being satisfactorily achieved, the manager, agency, or organization responsible  for forest management should determine a new course of action, such as modifying  the adaptation, modifying relevant SFM objectives, or acknowledging (and ideally  documenting) that the residual vulnerability to SFM is acceptable and that no further  changes to current activities are needed (see the decision-analysis framework for  adaptation to climate change, presented as Figure 4 in Williamson et al. [2012]).   All interested parties involved in or affected by the management and adaptation activities  being evaluated should be included in, or at least informed about, the monitoring and  evaluation of SFM and implementation of adaptations.  In an adaptive management context, there is a number of reasons for establishing  a monitoring or tracking program, in addition to monitoring the performance of  adaptations:   •  to determine whether the context of your management objectives and vulnerabilities  has changed    •  to assess if any of the underlying research is out of date   •  to track implementation progress   •  to communicate accomplishments through regular reporting   •  to support adaptive management   •  to highlight areas requiring management attention   •  to indicate where changes or revisions may be required to the adaptation plan.  6.4.2     The Practice  Where adaptations are mainstreamed into existing planning and practices, such as SFM  plans, existing monitoring approaches should be reviewed to ensure they account for  the adaptations. Additional monitoring should be considered to adequately track the  success of adaptations and catch any concerns early in the adaptation process. As well,  it may be necessary to refine existing indicators to integrate the new information from  this process. A recent report by Steenberg et al. (2013) provides guidance on adjusting  CCFM SFM indicators to reflect climate change adaptation (see “Case Study – Review of  SFM indicators for climate change”). Williamson and Edwards (2014) have suggested that a  national conversation may be required to address the potential impacts of climate change  on the national CCFM criteria and indicators.  If existing planning and practices do not include monitoring and evaluation, the  implementation of climate change adaptations may create an opportunity to integrate  these important management phases into the organization’s day-to-day operations,   Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Managment in Canada:    68  Chapter 6 A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making    Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Management in Canada:  A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making Chapter 6  69  Case Study – Review of SFM  indicators for climate change  Steenberg et al. (2013) have assessed the potential impacts of climate change on the  existing CCFM criteria and indicators and made recommendations for maintaining,  adjusting, or removing individual indicators. They also made recommendations for new  indicators.  again in support of mainstreaming. As a last resort, a separate monitoring and evaluation  plan could be developed that outlines resource requirements, roles of contributing  organizations, and individual responsibilities and milestones for monitoring SFM indicators  and implementation of adaptation actions.   A basic approach Keep it simple. Your list of indicators should be kept to a realistic, practical number. When  formulating your monitoring plan, consider the human and financial resources that  are available for monitoring, and prioritize the list of indicators to those that are most  meaningful for reporting on implementation progress and trends toward achieving SFM  objectives.   A comprehensive  approach  In the face of uncertainty, forest managers should take an approach that emphasizes ongoing  learning, whereby management adaptations are treated to some extent as “experiments,” and  new information collected through monitoring is evaluated to determine next steps. Adaptive  management recognizes the lack of knowledge about ecosystem function and climate  change and integrates continual learning.   Monitoring and evaluation should go hand in hand. Monitoring alone is useless if the  information it generates is not analyzed in a formal evaluation process. By quantitatively or  qualitatively describing status and trends over time, indicators provide the basis for before- and-after analyses.  Operational  considerations    Regardless of how monitoring and evaluation are accomplished—by mainstreaming into  existing activities, by adding these important steps to ongoing activities, or by creating  separate implementation and monitoring/evaluation plans—the roles and responsibilities  for these tasks must be clear, with defined reporting timelines. Including everyone who is  involved in implementing adaptations in the monitoring and evaluation phase will expedite  adaptation, promote continuous learning throughout partner organizations, and produce  more realistic refinements to adaptations when needed.   Strategic considerations  Monitoring provides the information needed to improve plans and take timely corrective  action. Success depends on a long-term commitment to integrate monitoring and  evaluation into ongoing operations, both during implementation and over the lifespan  of the adaptations. The selection of indicators for monitoring and the frequency of  monitoring may evolve over time. You might also consider coordinating indicators and their  measurement with other organizations and undertaking appropriate research initiatives to  maximize the value of the information collected.  Use Worksheet 6.4 (Evaluate adaptation performance) to describe how you plan to  evaluate adaptation performance.

Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Managment in Canada:    70  Chapter 6 A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making    CHAPTER 7    THE WORKSHEETS  The worksheets in this chapter are provided as guidance for completing an assessment  of SFM vulnerability to climate change and for identifying and implementing adaptation  options, as defined in the assessment framework (Williamson et al. 2012). The worksheets  represent one suggested approach to applying the assessment framework, and users of  this guidebook are encouraged to adapt them as required. The worksheets are structured  to stimulate and guide discussion within the assessment team and among interested  parties; they can also serve as cues for the types of information that will be useful for  the assessment. However, users should not be constrained by the tabular format of the  worksheets and should record information in whatever format is deemed most suitable.   Although sequential completion of the worksheets is recommended, it is not essential,  and users may find that an iterative process is required as the assessment project unfolds.  In addition, some worksheets or parts thereof will not be useful for certain projects. Each  assessment team must determine which worksheets will be most helpful for its own  project and what will be the best method for completing the worksheets, given the  resources available.   H I N T  The Forestry Adaptation  Community of Practice has   been established as a go-to  source of assistance for   forestry resource professionals  using this guidebook:   http://ccadaptation.ca/facop.  This online community contains  forums to post questions,  offer or access advice and  experience, and network with  other individuals interested in  adapting forestry to climate  change. Users of this guidebook  are encouraged to use the  community to share information  about and lessons learned from  their respective vulnerability  assessments.    Review the theory  and practice sections  associated with each  worksheet, as presented  in the preceding chapters.  These sections explain in  more detail the purpose of  each worksheet and each  section (e.g., table column)  within a worksheet. Keep in  mind that the worksheets  and tables represent a  suggested approach  to recording data and  discussions as you work  through the vulnerability  assessment process.  Some adaptation of the  worksheets is expected to  ensure that the outcomes  of the process fit the  context of your assessment.  H I N T  7.1 Worksheets for Chapter 1  The following three worksheets will get you started on assessing vulnerability and  mainstreaming adaptation into SFM. The worksheets are designed to facilitate project  initiation and to define the scope and scale of the vulnerability assessment. Each  worksheet consists of multiple tables.  Worksheet 1.1 Define the problem or challenge  Table 1.1   Factors prompting a vulnerability assessment for the SFM   system of interest  Table 1.2   Anticipated benefits of conducting a vulnerability assessment   and potential consequences of not doing so   Table 1.3   Statement of purpose for the vulnerability assessment  Table 1.4   Statement of one or more outcomes for the vulnerability   assessment  Worksheet 1.2  Describe the SFM system and define the scope of the vulnerability  assessment   Table 1.5   Description of the managed forest in the SFM system of  interest   Table 1.6   Overview of organization or agency that is undertaking the  vulnerability assessment   Table 1.7  Actors within the SFM system of interest  Table 1.8  Management objectives for the SFM system of interest  Table 1.9  Key nonclimatic factors currently affecting your SFM system  Worksheet 1.3 Confirm the scope of the assessment   Table 1.10  Resources available to carry out the vulnerability assessment   Table 1.11  Confirmation of the scope of the assessment  Worksheet 1.1. Define the problem or challenge  The goal of the tables in this worksheet is to address the question, “Is there a significant  concern about the effects of climate change on SFM in the region of interest, and if so, why?”  This worksheet also prompts you to articulate the purpose and expected outcomes of an  SFM vulnerability assessment should any significant concerns be raised and the need to  adapt be identified.

Factors prompting a vulnerability assessment for the SFM system of interest  1.1-A.     Factors prompting the assessment   Briefly describe factors in the categories listed in Table 1.1 that may have triggered your  desire to initiate a vulnerability assessment: environmental or ecological (e.g., a recent  extreme weather event; unprecedented forest disturbances), economic (e.g., demands  from investors or insurance agencies to consider climate change), or social and cultural  (e.g., market pressures to ensure sustainability under a changing climate). Examples of  possible factors are provided in Appendix 2.    Anticipated benefits of a vulnerability assessment Potential consequences of not conducting a  vulnerability assessment   1.1-B.     Anticipated benefits of conducting a vulnerability assessment  List the anticipated benefits of conducting a vulnerability assessment for the SFM system  of interest. You may also want to list the potential consequences of not doing so.   Table 1.2.      Anticipated benefits of conducting a vulnerability assessment and potential  consequences of not doing so  Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Managment in Canada:    74  Chapter 7 A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making    Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Management in Canada:  A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making Chapter 7  75  1.1-C.      Purpose and outcome statements for the vulnerability  assessment  For this part of the worksheet, consider the following questions: Why are you doing a  vulnerability assessment? What are the desired or expected outcomes of completing a  vulnerability assessment for the SFM system of interest? How will the results be used?  Refer back to these purpose and outcome statements when defining the scale and scope  of the assessment. Ensure that the scale is appropriate and the scope sufficient to achieve  the intended and expected outcomes. Defining these aspects early in the assessment  process will help you to focus the scope and participation level.  Statement of purpose:  Why are you undertaking the project?  Outcome statements: What do you hope to achieve?  Table 1.3.     Statement of purpose for the vulnerability assessment   Table 1.4.     Statement of one or more outcomes for the vulnerability assessment    1.1-D.      Factors causing significant concern  This step is intended to help identify and define significant concerns about the effects of  climate change on SFM. Answering the following question can help participants maintain  focus on the issues at hand.  Is there a significant concern about the effects of climate change on SFM in the region of  interest, and if so, why?  ________________________________________________________________________  ________________________________________________________________________  ________________________________________________________________________  ________________________________________________________________________  ________________________________________________________________________  ________________________________________________________________________  ________________________________________________________________________  Worksheet 1.2.  Describe the SFM system and define the scope  of the vulnerability assessment   The following types of information, among others, are needed to describe the SFM system  of interest:   • spatial and structural description of the managed forest system   •  benefits and values derived from the forest, including industrial production values  and nontimber values   •  overview of the organization or agency that is proposing to undertake the  assessment, including information about its responsibility and mandate for SFM   •  description of how SFM is defined and implemented relative to the system of interest  (i.e., SFM objectives).  The following sections of this worksheet provide guidance on describing the various  aspects and elements of the SFM system of interest.  1.2-A.     Description of the managed forest  Describe the spatial extent of the managed forest area selected for the vulnerability  assessment. Provide details about factors relevant to forest management (e.g., types and  distribution of ecosystems, species, age classes, timber volumes, disturbances), as well as  the timber and nontimber benefits and values derived from the forest (e.g., wood values,  recreational use, wildlife-related benefits, intrinsic forest values).

Overview of the organization or agency undertaking the  vulnerability assessment  Prepare an overview of the organization or agency that is proposing to undertake the  vulnerability assessment, including information about its responsibility and mandate for  SFM. Defining the planning timeframes (e.g., detailed operations plans, timber supply  plan horizons, SFM plans) at this stage of the process can help to determine the relevant  timeframe for the assessment.  Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Managment in Canada:    78  Chapter 7 A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making    Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Management in Canada:  A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making Chapter 7  79  1.2-C.      Human elements of the SFM system (actors and their  decision-making scope)  List the organizations and individuals involved in planning and operations in your SFM  system and describe the role of each individual (e.g., prepares plans, approves plans,  provides advice, supervises operations, monitors operations).    Decisions about managing forest resources will affect a wide range of other values that  society derives from the forest. Therefore, you may also want to consider who will be  affected by these decisions, so you can invite them to participate in the assessment or  keep them informed of progress and outcomes. Having other interested parties (e.g.,  stakeholders) involved or kept informed from the outset can be of assistance if you wish to  try new SFM options.  The human elements of an SFM system may include (but are not limited to) the following:    •  agencies involved in overall land management or organizations that partner in the  management of the area   •  agencies involved in reviewing or approving plans for compliance and enforcement   •  organizations holding land-use tenures    •  any organization that can affect decisions for the area   •  any organization or individuals that may be affected by decisions for the area  Table 1.7.     Actors within the SFM system of interest   Organizations with   a role in the SFM system  Individuals involved   with the SFM system  Role of organization or individual    1.2-D.     SFM criteria and objectives   A primary aspect of structured decision making is defining what you are trying to achieve  by actively managing a system. In other words, what are the management objectives?  This worksheet is critical to the vulnerability assessment, as  the objectives listed here are referenced throughout the rest  of the guidebook (especially Worksheet 4.1 and beyond). The  central focus of the CCFM vulnerability assessment approach  is to determine what impacts climate change may have on  your ability to achieve your management objectives. Also,  adaptation options defined later in the assessment process  should be linked to these objectives.  This guidebook focuses on the national SFM criteria, as defined by the CCFM (2003, 2006)  and listed below (see Appendix 3 for a complete list of indicators for each CCFM criterion).   The system of interest that you have defined may use the same structure, or it may have  different categories of criteria. List the management goals or objectives in your area, using  whatever structure is relevant for your system.  Criterion 1.  Biological diversity: Maintaining biological diversity so that organisms and  ecosystems can respond and adapt to environmental change.  Criterion 2.  Ecosystem condition and productivity: Ensuring that forest ecosystems  can cope with and recover from natural and human disturbances and  maintain their ecological functions and processes.  Criterion 3.  Soil and water: Modifying management techniques to minimize disturbance,  erosion, and compaction.  Criterion 4.  Role in global ecological cycles (specifically forest carbon management):  Ensuring that forests are able to depend on and contribute to self-regulating  processes responsible for carbon, water, nitrogen, and other life-sustaining  elements.  Criterion 5.  Economic and social benefits: Providing a broad range of forest goods and  services over the long term, offering significant economic and social benefits.  Criterion 6.  Society’s responsibility: Reflecting social values in forest operations and  recognizing that many rural communities depend on the forest for their  economic, social, and cultural well-being.  Note: It may also be useful to reference any documentation on forest management  planning, practices, procedures, and indicators that you use to achieve and track these  management objectives. The assessment team may also want to explore any assumptions  made in relation to the objectives (e.g., an objective that states “management practices  will maintain forest cover strata as it exists today” likely assumes that climate will remain  constant). Understanding these assumptions can aid during the vulnerability assessment  steps in section 7.4.

Management objectives for the SFM system of interest  Criterion Management objective  Biological diversity  Ecosystem condition and productivity  Soil and water  Role in global ecological cycles  Economic and social benefits  Society’s responsibility    1.2-E.     Key nonclimatic factors currently affecting your SFM system  List any factors that are currently affecting your ability to achieve your SFM objectives (e.g.,  markets, shortage of workers, changes in land use, lack of data). These factors may affect  your SFM system into the future and will need to be considered, along with any climate  change impacts, during the vulnerability assessment. Identifying these factors now will  help when developing future scenarios later in the process (section 7.3).  Table 1.9.     Key nonclimatic factors currently affecting your SFM system  Factor Effect on achieving SFM objectives Additional effects of climate  change on this factor in relation to  achieving SFM objectives  Example: other land-use activities Example: reduced productive forested  area within forest management area  Example: potential for increased fire  and forest pest outbreaks may further  reduce timber supply, adding to the  net loss of productive forest area  Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Managment in Canada:    82  Chapter 7 A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making    Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Management in Canada:  A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making Chapter 7  83  Worksheet 1.3. Confirm the scope of the assessment   The purpose of this worksheet is to identify the resources currently available to undertake  an SFM vulnerability assessment at the scale and scope identified above, specifically  whether the agency or organization is equipped to complete the vulnerability assessment.  1.3-A.     Available resources  List all resources currently available within your organization that may be of use for  conducting the vulnerability assessment as currently scoped. You may also wish to  consider resources available through existing partnerships or collaborations.   Table 1.10.     Resources available to carry out the vulnerability assessment  Resource Description  Human resources (e.g., operational, coordination, administrative)  Information resources (e.g., specialists, researchers, databases)  Financial resources (direct money, in-kind)  Existing initiatives, programs, and research projects, that may be of interest (describe nature of the work, how and where to  link to the work, and potential collaboration)    1.3-B.      Summary of purpose and scope of the vulnerability  assessment   This step is a recap of the worksheets completed so far. The point is to develop a short  summary (e.g., two pages) of purpose and scope that can be used to garner support for  the assessment from decision makers and other interested parties, if required.  1.

Can you do it? Do you have the capacity to undertake the vulnerability assessment as  you have defined it? See Reality Check on the next page (section 1.3-C).   _____________________________________________________________________   _____________________________________________________________________  Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Managment in Canada:    84  Chapter 7 A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making    Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Management in Canada:  A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making Chapter 7  85  1.3-C.     Reality check  Consider each question in Table 1.11 and respond Yes or No, adding notes to explain your  response.  Table 1.11.     Confirmation of the scope of the assessment  Scope questions Response  Yes           No  Notes  Does your organization have a   particular need to complete a   vulnerability assessment of SFM   objectives and climate change?  Are there regular planning  processes (e.g., SFM plan, annual  work plan?) into which climate  change adaptation could be  mainstreamed?  If you need a person to champion  this assessment to ensure it goes  forward within your organization,  has someone been identified or  assigned to the task?  Have you given thought to the  human, financial, and information  resources required to complete (or  at least get a good start on) the  vulnerability assessment?  Is your organization willing to  implement adaptation actions?  Are groups and individuals that  affect or are affected by your  forest management decisions  likely to support climate change  adaptation?  Are there other factors that should  be considered?     If most of the responses in Table 1.11 are “yes,” then your team is likely ready to go forward  with a vulnerability assessment and adaptation project at the scale and scope you have  defined. Remember that the process is intended to be iterative and adaptive; you can  always get started and come back to certain steps once new information or knowledge is  gained.  If most of the responses in Table 1.11 are “no,” then you probably need to do some  additional preplanning to overcome some of the shortfalls. The following suggestions may  help:   •  If human, financial, and/or information resources are limited or unavailable, you might  look to other initiatives, programs, databases, research projects, etc., for support.  Partnering with a local college or university to compile information or do analyses  may be effective.    •  Review the worksheets for chapter 1 with colleagues and managers to boost their  understanding of potential impacts, and identify a champion if one is needed.   •  If interested groups or individuals are unlikely to support adaptation actions, consider  having a respected champion speak to them, or review the worksheets for chapter 1  with them.   •  Consider assessing a smaller geographic area or a selection of SFM activities for a  better match with available expertise and resources.  1.3-D.     Refine the scope of the assessment   Getting started with an assessment, even if it has not been perfectly defined, is often more  beneficial than waiting until all the required resources can be gathered and the timing is  “perfect.” That said, starting a complex task such as vulnerability assessment without a clear  scope and without knowing that the assessment is feasible and achievable can lead to  failure (see Moser and Ekstrom 2010).  At this stage, you should have a clear and defined statement of purpose for the  vulnerability assessment, along with its expected outcomes. You will also have defined the  scope in terms of both geography and participants. Now is a good time to examine the  goals and scope and ensure you have the ability to achieve them. If not, you may want to  redefine the statement of purpose, narrow the scope, or find additional resources before  proceeding.

Describe the relationships among climate,  forest conditions, and forest management  practices  You will need to consider how climate (or weather) influences current forest management  practices and plans.    Forest conditions and processes Relationship of climate to forest  condition  Relationship of forest condition to forest  management practices  Composition, productivity,  disturbances, etc. (see Appendix 4  for more examples)  Example for disturbances: Wildfire  is directly related to stand type and  weather. Describe the role of fire and  how fire shapes forest composition  and productivity.  Example for wildfire: Describe how fire is  managed in your area and how variability  in climate and weather is incorporated into  wildfire management.     Table 2.2.      Relationships among current climate, forest conditions, and forest management  practices     Worksheet 2.3.  Describe how recent climate trends or  changes in forest conditions have led to  changes in forest management practices  The aim of this worksheet is to highlight your organization’s ability to adapt to new  conditions. Climate change may already be influencing the forest ecosystem, and you may  already be adapting policies and practices in response to these influences. If you have  not yet noticed any changes to forest conditions in your area, there may be other factors  unrelated to climate that have caused you to alter forest management plans or practices  (e.g., changing markets).   Recent changes to forest  conditions and processes  Description of change   in forest condition   Description of changes   in forest management   Example: Climate (or weather) has  been drier and hotter for the past  decade, leading to increases in fire  severity and area burned.  Example: An increase in wildfire  has led to greater mortality of trees  (reduced timber supply), a reduction  in conifer forest area (change in  composition), and an increase in  younger forests (altered age classes).   Example: Changes caused by wildfire have  led to increased salvaging operations,  increased fire-fighting capacities and  capabilities, and changes in allowable  annual cut.  Table 2.3.

Develop and describe future climate scenarios    Climate baseline – The baseline climate normals recorded in Worksheet 2.1 (Describe  climatic conditions and trends) will be used as a point of reference. For many of the  available climate projections, the baseline period is often taken as 1961–1990 or 1971– 2000.   Climate scenarios – Once you have selected your climate scenarios, complete Table  3.1, below. This table presents a suggested list of climate and climate-related factors. You  should adjust the list to include other factors that are relevant to your SFM system of  interest.  Scenarios can be developed in a number of ways. For example, the overall timeframe  for the scenarios may be 2014–2100 with scenarios 1–3 representing segments of time  within this period (e.g., 2014–2040, 2041–2070, 2071–2100). Alternatively, you may wish to  look at three or more scenarios of various degrees of climate change (e.g., low, medium,  high) within a certain time frame (e.g., 2041–2070). Ideally, you should examine a range of  scenarios spanning minimal to extensive climate change.   You may need to use multiple copies of these worksheets to develop a full range of  scenarios, and you may also want to include detailed descriptions (e.g., narratives) of the  scenarios in addition to completing the tabular worksheet.  A web application to generate various climate estimates for specific locations   of interest anywhere in Canada or the United States is available at   http://gmaps.nrcan.gc.ca/cl_p/climatepoints.php.

Develop and describe forest impact scenarios  The term “impact” refers to the effects of climate change on natural and human systems.  The effect may be direct (e.g., a change in tree growth in response to a change in the  mean, range, or variability of temperature) or indirect (e.g., some influence on the  frequency and severity of wildfires).  Forest impacts are based both on climate exposure, as described in Worksheet 3.1  (Develop and describe future climate scenarios), and forest ecosystem sensitivity,  the degree to which a system will respond to changes in climatic conditions and climate  variability (e.g., extent of change in ecosystem composition, structure, and function).   In this worksheet, you can describe the range of impacts that the climate change  scenarios developed in the Worksheet 3.1 may have on various aspects of the forest  ecosystems within the SFM system of interest. The intent is to help you understand how  these potential impacts may affect your ability to achieve SFM objectives (see section 7.4).  Use the same list of forest conditions and processes that you developed in Worksheet  2.2 (Describe the relationships among climate, forest conditions, and forest  management practices) as a starting point.  You may also want to assess an overall forest impact ranking for each scenario, using the  following ranking system (see last row of Table 3.2).  Impact on forest ecosystems   High impact Moderate impact Low impact  Sensitivity of forest ecosystem to climate change  Low Moderate High  C lim  at e   ch an  g e   re la  ti ve   to     cu rr  en t c  lim at  e  (e  xp os  ur e)  High  Moderate  Low    Table 3.2.

Table 4.5  Decision about adaptation  Worksheet 4.1.  Assess current and future impacts on SFM   The ability to achieve SFM objectives in the future will be affected by expected impacts  on the forest ecosystem from a changing climate and the sensitivity of the objectives to  changes in forest ecosystems. Use the forest impacts scenarios and the overall impact  rankings you created using Worksheet 3.2 (Develop and describe forest impact  scenarios) as the basis for this worksheet. Populate these tables using the best available  information (studies, expert judgments, datasets, model outputs, etc.). Note the source  of information used to make each assessment. Given that the assessment of impacts  on achieving SFM objectives under various future climates is somewhat subjective, the  assessment team may not reach consensus on rankings. In that situation, noting the range  of sensitivity (e.g., moderate to high) is an option.  To start, complete the column in Table 4.1 for impacts of current climate (and climate  variability) on the ability to achieve SFM objectives. This should help you to become  familiar with the process of describing how climate affects SFM objectives before  introducing the added complexity of future climate change scenarios.     The following ranking system is one method of ranking the impacts of climate and climate  change on each of the SFM objectives. The forest impact ranking was determined in  Worksheet 3.2 (Develop and describe forest impact scenarios) and the sensitivity  of the SFM objective is determined by the assessment team using the best available  information and judgment.

Evaluate adaptive capacity of the SFM system  This worksheet provides a set of questions to guide the assessment of adaptive capacity  as part of the broader vulnerability assessment approach described within this guidebook.  The approach presented in this worksheet is relatively simple and direct. More intricate  analysis of adaptive capacity can also be pursued but may require the participation of  specialists. Williamson and Isaac (2013) provided a detailed overview of approaches for  assessing adaptive capacity.   The capacity to adapt is the ability of individuals, organizations, or management systems  to adjust to change, to take actions to moderate potential damages, to take advantage  of opportunities, or to cope with the consequences of change. The means to adapt are  a function of the assets and resources that contribute to adaptability (e.g., knowledge  capital, human capital, social capital) and the factors that affect the ability to effectively  mobilize or utilize adaptive capacity resources (e.g., awareness and perceptions of  risk). Investment in adaptive capacity and the process of mobilizing adaptive capacity  resources are also influenced by institutions. Sometimes, existing institutions pose  barriers to adaptation (thereby reducing adaptive capacity). Thus, the ability to adapt  may also depend on the ability to adjust, modify, or transform institutions. The ease with  which institutions can be modified or transformed is in turn affected by the system of  governance. The following are some of the key factors that contribute to the adaptive  capacity of SFM organizations or systems: awareness and risk perceptions, knowledge  capital, human capital, social capital (partnerships and networks), institutions, and resource  governance. Questions related to each of these categories are presented in the Tables   4.2.1 – 4.2.6.  It should be noted that the capacity to adapt to climate change is not the same as a  general capacity to adapt, although these concepts are related. SFM organizations and  systems with a certain general capacity to adapt may in fact have a lower capacity to  adapt to climate change. For example, a particular SFM organization or system might have  significant human capital but lower human capital relevant to climate change impacts  and adaptation. For the purposes of this assessment, both general adaptive capacity and  adaptive capacity specific to climate change are of interest.  What is being assessed? The first step in assessing adaptive capacity is to identify  and describe the organization or system that is being assessed. The adaptive capacity  assessment should align as closely as possible with the organization or system defined in  section 7.1, above.   104  Chapter 7 A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making    Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Management in Canada:  A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making Chapter 7  105  How should the assessment be completed? The goal of this step is to assess the  adaptive capacity or adaptability of the SFM organization or system, not to evaluate  specific adaptations. Nonetheless, it may be helpful to think of adaptive capacity in  terms of what would be needed to implement potential adaptations. For example,  implementing a potential adaptation may require research, budget reallocation, increased  funding, knowledge exchange, education, more knowledgeable staff, stronger networks,  or changes in rules and policies. The question of adaptability pertains to the degree to  which the resources that enable adaptation are available, the degree to which institutions  are designed to permit adaptation where it is justified, and the flexibility of governance to  allow for changes in institutions where they are needed and justified.    Tables 4.2.1 – 4.2.6 present a series of questions to guide you through an assessment of  the adaptive capacity of your SFM system of interest. Many of the questions ask you to  rank your response (e.g., high, medium, or low) and significant space is provided to record  details of why a certain rank was chosen. It is likely members of the assessment team may  have differing opinions on certain questions. It would be useful to record any discussions  had on each question or difference of opinions presented within the assessment team.       4.2.1      Awareness and understanding of climate change and  perceptions of risk related to climate change  Awareness and understanding of the potential effects of climate change and perceptions  of risk by political leaders, senior policy makers, forest management practitioners, SFM  stakeholders, and the general public will significantly influence preparedness and  willingness to implement adaptation measures at various levels. Stakeholders includes  those with a direct stake in forest resource management, including the forest industry,  First Nations, nongovernmental organizations, other governments, grazing lease holders,  trappers, outdoor recreation users, outfitters, professional foresters organizations, forest- based communities.

In the context of climate change, knowledge capital is the  stock of relevant knowledge or information that supports impacts analysis and adaptation  decision making for the SFM organization or system of interest. Knowledge capital related  to climate change also includes the ability to develop, interpret, and utilize scientific  knowledge and information about climate change and the ability to communicate  and make accessible relevant knowledge and information. It includes the processes by  which information is acquired, accessed, and communicated, as well as the capacity for  knowledge exchange. Knowledge exchange and information management contribute  to increased awareness of climate change and to more informed and effective decision  making. Knowledge gaps can pose significant barriers to adaptation.   What is the overall general state of knowledge capital for the SFM system of interest?

Ranking or  response  Discussion  Table 4.2.4.     Assessment of social capital    4.2.5     Institutions   Institutions are the laws, policies, customs, traditions, accepted practices, property rights,  rules, norms, protocols, and standards that guide, direct, prescribe, or motivate forest  management decisions and choices. Institutions can be formal (e.g., laws and policies) or  informal (e.g., norms and customs).   Successful adaptation (i.e., adaptation that is rational, effective, and justified) requires  that institutions allow for consideration of the current and potential future impacts of  climate change on forests and on human values associated with forests. That is to say,  institutions that effectively account for climate change provide the motivation, incentives,  and authority for rational adaptation, along with disincentives or sanctions for failure to  adapt (in cases where adaptation is warranted) or for maladaptation (i.e., inappropriate  or unjustified adaptation). Institutions represent a key component of adaptive capacity,  because those that fail to account for climate change will likely act as barriers to rational  adaptation.   One of the major challenges to forestry institutions is to account for the increased levels  of complexity and uncertainty associated with forest management policy, planning, and  decision making under a changing climate. Institutional characteristics that are typically  favoured by decision makers and stakeholders are lack of ambiguity, predictability, fairness,  efficiency, stability, and consistency. However, under a changing climate, the following  characteristics of forestry institutions are desirable: they explicitly recognize the potential  impacts of climate change; they are forward-looking, while accounting for the significant  uncertainties of future forest conditions and forest values under a changing climate; they  are flexible; they are responsive; they accommodate or incorporate a diverse range of  management options and forest conditions; they enable or permit adaptation to local  impacts; they permit or enable, to some degree, an adaptive management approach; and  they provide appropriate incentives for building adaptability or adaptive capacity.        The influence of institutions on the adaptive capacity of SFM systems can be assessed  in various ways. The table below presents a number of questions related to general  characteristics of forest management institutions, followed by an assessment of specific  climate change adaptability considerations related to SFM policy, assessment and  monitoring, forest management planning, and forest management practices (e.g.,  reforestation, harvesting).

Given the preponderance of provincially owned forest land in Canada,  forest resource governance is largely the responsibility of provincial forest management  agencies. Resource governance regimes in Canada are continuously evolving and  adapting to new ecological, economic, cultural and social conditions. Modifying  institutions in response to change is not a novel concept. However, climate change  offers a new and somewhat unprecedented driver of change. It is not something that  resource governance regimes have necessarily experienced in the past or for which  they have precedents. The relative capacity of resource governance systems to make  necessary changes to institutions to properly adapt to climate change, and the ease with  which they do so, will vary from situation to situation. Thus, this section of the adaptive  capacity assessment considers the ability of resource governance regimes to adapt their  institutions in anticipation of climate change, considering both the mechanisms and the  challenges of adapting institutions. A self-assessment approach is proposed.    Table 4.2.5.     Concluded  4.2.5.6 Practices  Do forest management practices, guidelines, and on-the-ground decisions consider climate change?

Assess current and future vulnerability  Use the results from the two preceding worksheets (Worksheet 4.1 and Worksheet 4.2)  to complete Worksheet 4.3 (Assess current and future vulnerability).  Use the vulnerability matrix below to rank the current vulnerability of the SFM system in  terms of the ability to achieve management objectives. Then rank the future vulnerability  of achieving each SFM objective.   Instead of seeking consensus on a single ranking, you may wish to provide a range of  rankings from various sources.  Vulnerability matrix for SFM objective or system    High vulnerability Moderate vulnerability Low vulnerability  Intuitive scan: Once you have completed the rankings for each objective, scan the  vulnerability rankings to intuitively check for internal consistency and logical results.  Explore inconsistencies by returning to the earlier worksheets to understand the  background information that led to the ranking.  Once you have scanned and, if necessary, adjusted the vulnerability rankings for each  objective, conduct a scan across all the objectives. This is particularly important if different  focus groups completed the assessments for different objectives. Again, check for internal  consistency and logic, and adjust as needed.  Use the impacts on SFM objectives determined in Worksheet 4.1 (Assess current and  future impacts on SFM) and the assessment of adaptive capacity to climate change  from Worksheet 4.2 (Evaluate adaptive capacity of the SFM system) to determine  the vulnerability of SFM objectives under current climate conditions and future climate  scenarios.  Use current adaptive capacity to assess the vulnerability of the SFM objectives (as listed  in Table 1.9 in Worksheet 1.2-D) in each scenario. Use additional pages if necessary to  describe the potential vulnerabilities that you identify.   116  Chapter 7 A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making    Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Management in Canada:  A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making Chapter 7  117  SF M   o b  je ct  iv es    (T  ab le   1 .9  )  .

Decision point: Is adaptation required?  If the SFM system of interest is vulnerable to climate change impacts or if the system is  expected to be vulnerable in any of the future climate scenarios, you will want to proceed  with identifying and implementing adaptation options (as detailed in sections 7.5 and 7.6,  below). If the vulnerability of the SFM system is low and the potential effects of climate  change under the various scenarios are mild, you may wish to monitor the system and  reassess vulnerability as you gain new knowledge, learning, or insights.  Is adaptation required? Action     Yes Proceed to sections 7.5 and 7.6     No Continue to monitor the SFM system and   reassess vulnerability if changes are noticed   or if new knowledge is gained  Table 4.5.     Decision about adaptation    7.5 Worksheets for Chapter 5 The following worksheets are designed to help you develop and assess adaptation  options for SFM.

Develop potential adaptation for SFM  objectives  Prioritize the vulnerabilities of SFM objectives: On the basis of work done in Table 4.3,  review the vulnerability (i.e., high, medium, or low) of the SFM objectives in your study  area to current climate and future scenarios of climate change. You may want to sort  the vulnerabilities from high to low, or start only with objectives that are ranked high or  medium across all scenarios. Record the selected priority objectives in the table below and  indicate how they are vulnerable to climate change. This step is optional, and you may  instead decide to consider all vulnerabilities listed in Table 4.3.  Table 5.1.     Prioritize vulnerabilities of SFM objectives  SFM objectives Current vulnerability Future vulnerability –  scenario 1  Future vulnerability –  scenario 2  Future vulnerability –  scenario 3     Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Managment in Canada:    120     Chapter 7 A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making    Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Management in Canada:  A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making Chapter 7  121  Develop a list of potential adaptation options: All options can be considered at this  stage, with prioritization and feasibility of implementation to be assessed later. You may  first want to review the list of adaptation options in Appendix 5. These options, compiled  from the literature, are suggested ways to adapt forest management policies and practices  to achieve management objectives in a changing climate. In Table 5.2, list potential  adaptation options for each SFM objective. You may also want to flag certain options as  follows:  •  Classify options as strategic, operational, or adaptive capacity options (doing so now  may help to define an implementation plan later on).  •  Indicate whether each adaptation option is useful for reducing a negative impact on the  objective or increasing a potential opportunity to help achieve the objective.  Reviewing the knowledge gaps and uncertainties list you have created as you have  worked through this guidebook may also be a good starting point for identifying options.  You may want to describe the adaptation options in more detail than the space in Table  5.2 allows; if so, use additional pages.

Develop potential adaptation options for the  overall SFM system of interest  In this worksheet you will develop options to reduce SFM system vulnerabilities or  increase SFM system-wide adaptive capacity.  Refer back to Worksheet 4.4 (Assess overall SFM system vulnerability) and  consider whether there are options that could be implemented to reduce SFM system  vulnerabilities or increase SFM system-wide adaptive capacity. Such options would  span many or all SFM objectives (e.g., increased partnerships and collaborations with  governments, research institutes, and stakeholders or interested parties; new approach to  decision making within your organization).  Assess these broader options according to a scale of the importance of implementation of  each option for achieving SFM objectives. The following scale could be used to rate these  options:  VI = very important, I = important, N = not important, ? = importance unknown.  Identify adaptation options that are more generally important (e.g., those that are robust,  no-regret, win–win, and must-do).    Ta b  le  5  .3 .

Recommend priority adaptation options for  implementation  Use the list of top-priority adaptation options to complete Tables 6.3 and 6.4. For each  option, assess the following:   •  Is the option a modification of current practice? If so, note where it is referenced in an  existing policy, plan, or operations guide.   •  Is the adaptation ecologically suitable and socially acceptable?   •  Is the implementation of the adaptation financially and technically feasible?  In particular, is implementation feasible given institutional and organizational  considerations?    •  Does the option conflict with other management objectives or SFM values? If so, note  them here. Are these conflicts resolvable?    •  Given the suitability, feasibility, and potential conflicts, can the adaptation option be  recommended for implementation?    •  What is the timeframe for implementation (e.g., immediate, near future, distant  future). Define the various timeframes in specific terms.    •  With implementation of these adaptations, do you expect to be able to achieve SFM  objectives in your study area? Indicate yes, no, or uncertain in Table 6.4, with a brief  explanation.      Ta b  le  6  .3 .

Implement (mainstream) recommended  adaptations  Using the template presented in Table 6.5, identify the implementation requirements  associated with each priority adaptation option. You may want to group the options by  SFM objective and overall SFM system adaptation options or by strategic, operational, or  adaptive capacity categorization. For each recommended adaptation option, consider the  following:    •  Assess the jurisdiction within which the adaptation actions fall and the roles and  responsibilities of various agencies and individuals in implementation.   •  Identify the actions required to implement the adaptation (e.g., changes in planning,  procedures, policies, regulations, legislation, investments, protocols, guidelines,  training, and operational methods).    •  Identify opportunities to mainstream the adaptation into regular business processes.   •  Identify roles and responsibilities (i.e., the specific person or department that will lead  implementation and other individuals or departments that should be involved). Set  deadlines for implementation progress.   •  Assess the internal support required for implementation to proceed (e.g., operational  staff, specialists, senior management, political leaders).    •  Assess the external support required for implementation to proceed (e.g.,  involvement or buy-in from other organizations).   •  Identify the human resources required for implementation to proceed and assess  whether these resources are available or if they must be secured.   •  Assess information and/or training needs that may be required to implement the  adaptation.   •  Identify the financial resources required for implementation to proceed and assess  whether these resources are available or if they must be secured.   •  Describe what successful implementation would look like (e.g., all planning and  operations staff are knowledgeable about climate change impacts and adaptation;  silvicultural operations reflect changes in precipitation).    •  Identify the overall schedule, the timing of specific events, and the milestones  associated with implementation.   •  Determine if there is a need to communicate with decision makers, other staff, or  interested parties about the adaptation and its potential implications.   •  Determine if there is an existing monitoring or tracking plan into which this  adaptation should be incorporated.   •  Consider whether the adaptation can help to achieve other non-SFM objectives or  goals.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS  Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Managment in Canada:    134  Chapter 7 A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making    Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Management in Canada:  A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making Appendixes  135  APPENDIXES    Appendix 1. Glossary  Adaptation   “Adjustment in natural or human systems in response to actual or expected climatic  stimuli or their effects, which moderates harm or exploits beneficial opportunities” (Parry  et al. 2007).  Adaptation options  Potential actions or activities to address or reduce the vulnerabilities identified in a  vulnerability assessment.  Adaptation recommendations  A subset of adaptation options, consisting of those options that will benefit sustainable  forest management objectives and for which implementation is acceptable and feasible.  Adaptive capacity  “The ability of a system to adjust to climate change (including climate variability and  extremes) to moderate potential damages, to take advantage of opportunities, or to cope  with the consequences” (Parry et al. 2007). In this report, adaptive capacity refers to the  human (as opposed to the biological) components of the sustainable forest management  system.  Adaptive capacity assessment  Assessment of (1) the human and institutional resources and capacities (for example,  human capital, social capital) available to identify adaptation requirements and to  implement adaptation actions; (2) the structural attributes, properties, and characteristics  that affect the ability of a system to adapt (for example, flexibility, rigidity, diversity,  liquidity, substitutability); and (3) the factors that impair optimal choices related to  adaptation and adaptive capacity requirements (for example, inefficient institutions,  critical knowledge gaps, lack of awareness, biased perceptions of risk).  Adaptive management  “A systematic process for continually improving management policies and practices by  learning from the outcomes of previously employed policies and practices” (MEA 2005).    Climate  “Climate in a narrow sense is usually defined as the ‘average weather’, or more rigorously,  as the statistical description in terms of the mean and variability of relevant quantities over  a period of time ranging from months to thousands or millions of years. These quantities  are most often surface variables such as temperature, precipitation, and wind. Climate   Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Managment in Canada:    136  Appendixes A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making    Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Management in Canada:  A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making Appendixes  137  in a wider sense is the state, including a statistical description, of the climate system. The  classical period of time is 30 years, as defined by the World Meteorological Organization  (WMO)” (Parry et al. 2007).  Climate change  “Climate change refers to any change in climate over time, whether due to natural  variability or as a result of human activity. This usage differs from that in the United Nations  Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which defines ‘climate change’ as:  ‘a change of climate which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters  the composition of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate  variability observed over comparable time periods’” (Parry et al. 2007).  Climate change impacts  “The effects of climate change on natural and human systems. Depending on the  consideration of adaptation, one can distinguish between potential impacts and residual  impacts.” Potential impacts are “all impacts that may occur given a projected change in  climate, without considering adaptation.” Residual impacts are “the impacts of climate  change that would occur after adaptation” (Parry et al. 2007). In vulnerability assessment,  impacts are the result of exposure to climate change and the sensitivity of the sustainable  forest management system to a particular level of exposure.  Climate variability  “Variations in the mean state and other statistics (such as standard deviations, the  occurrence of extremes, etc.) of the climate on all temporal and spatial scales beyond  that of individual weather events. The term is often used to denote deviations of climatic  statistics over a given period of time (e.g. a month, season or year) from the long-term  statistics relating to the corresponding calendar period. In this sense, climate variability is  measured by those deviations, which are usually termed anomalies. Variability may be due  to natural internal processes within the climate system (internal variability), or to variations  in natural or anthropogenic external forcing (external variability)” (WMO n.d.).  Driver  Any natural or human-induced factor that directly or indirectly causes a change in a  system, such as an ecosystem, managed forest, or human community (MEA 2005).  Examples include changes in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases driving  changes in planetary mean temperature or changes in societal values driving changes in  forest use.  Ecosystem  “The interactive system formed from all living organisms and their abiotic (physical and  chemical) environment within a given area. Ecosystems cover a hierarchy of spatial  scales and can comprise the entire globe, biomes at the continental scale or small, well- circumscribed systems such as a small pond” (Parry et al. 2007).    Ecosystem services  “Ecological services or functions having monetary or non-monetary value to individuals  or society at large. There are (i) supporting services such as productivity or biodiversity  maintenance, (ii) provisioning services such as good, fibre, or fish, (iii) regulating services  such as climate regulation or carbon sequestration, and (iv) cultural services such as  tourism or spiritual and aesthetic appreciation” (Parry et al. 2007).  Ecozone  “A broad, ecologically distinctive area delineated at a subcontinental level and defined by  its interaction of human, vegetative, wildlife, climatic, geologic, and physiographic factors.  Canada’s ecological land classification framework comprises 15 terrestrial ecozones; these  are subdivided into 53 ecoprovinces, the ecoprovinces into 194 ecoregions, and the  ecoregions into 1020 ecodistricts” (CCFM 2006).  Exposure  The degree of climate change imposed upon a particular unit of analysis. Exposure may be  represented as long-term changes in climate conditions, as well as by changes in climate  variability, including the magnitude and frequency of extreme events (McCarthy et al.  2001).   Forest impact scenarios  A range of possible future forest conditions that could result under a given climate  scenario. Forest impact scenarios include descriptions of changes in (1) processes such  as physiological processes, phenological processes, and regeneration; (2) the frequency  and intensity of biotic disturbances, such as insect outbreaks and diseases, and abiotic  disturbances, such as severe weather, drought, and wildfire; (3) ecosystem health and  productivity; (4) forest inventory; and (5) forest composition and age-class over the  landscape.  Mainstreaming adaptation  Inclusion of climate change considerations in day-to-day decision making and  management on a continuous and ongoing basis.  Resilience  “The ability of a social or ecological system to absorb disturbances while retaining the  same basic structure and ways of functioning, the capacity for self-organisation, and the  capacity to adapt to stress and change” (Parry et al. 2007).  Scenarios  “A plausible and often simplified description of how the future may develop, based  on a coherent and internally consistent set of assumptions about driving forces and   Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Managment in Canada:    138  Appendixes A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making    Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Management in Canada:  A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making Appendixes  139  key relationships. Scenarios may be derived from projections, but are often based on  additional information from other sources, sometimes combined within a ‘narrative  storyline’” (Parry et al. 2007). Scenarios are not predictions, and they typically do not  include prediction errors or likelihoods.  Sensitivity  “The degree to which a system is affected, either adversely or beneficially, by climate  variability or change. The effect may be direct (e.g., a change in crop yield in response to a  change in the mean, range or variability of temperature) or indirect (e.g., damages caused  by an increase in the frequency of coastal flooding due to sea-level rise)” (Parry et al. 2007).  Sensitivity assessment  Assessment of the sensitivity or magnitude of a system’s potential response to a particular  rate and magnitude of change in local climate (including change in mean values and  changes in variability and extremes). Sensitivity can be reduced or modified by adaptation.  Sustainable forest management (SFM)   “Management that maintains and enhances the long-term health of forest ecosystems  for the benefit of all living things while providing environmental, economic, social, and  cultural opportunities for present and future generations” (CCFM 2008). According to the  Canadian Council of Forest Ministers, the criteria for defining and monitoring sustainable  forest management in Canada are biodiversity, ecosystem condition and productivity, soil  and water, role of the forests in global ecological cycles, economic and social benefits, and  society’s responsibility.  Sustainable forest management system  A coupled human–environmental system that obtains goods and services from forests  and works toward the management of forests in a manner consistent with sustainable  forest management (SFM) principles and objectives. SFM systems vary with spatial,  operational, and organizational contexts. An SFM system can exist at any scale, including  provincial forests, community forests, protected areas, industrial lease areas, and small  private woodlots.  Vulnerability  “The degree to which a system is susceptible to, and unable to cope with, adverse effects  of climate change, including climate variability and extremes. Vulnerability is a function of  the character, magnitude, and rate of climate change and variation to which a system is  exposed, its sensitivity, and its adaptive capacity” (Parry et al. 2007).
