Although it  can happen at any time of year, the most severe floods typically occur  in spring—known as freshet—or during fall and winter. This seasonal  flooding is usually caused by heavy rain and snowmelt.  Homes may be at risk when flood water spreads to adjoining areas  that are normally dry. Depending on the type and severity of flooding,  it could take hours, weeks and potentially months for the water to  recede and the clean-up to begin. The advice provided in this guide  will help to make informed choices when purchasing a home or  working to protect it.      A D V I C E  F O R  P R O T E C T I N G  Y O U R  H O M E  A N D  P R O P E R T Y  3  Purchasing a home When buying a home, it is important to know if the property is in a  flood-prone area. Here are some things to do and questions to ask:    Contact your local government and ask if flood-hazard mapping is  available and what the flood construction level (FCL) is for the area.    Complete a home inspection to see if the home has been subject  to past flooding. This can include hiring a qualified professional,  such as a hydraulic or hydrotechnical engineer, to conduct a  property assessment.    Speak with neighbours to learn more about the area’s history.

Simple, inexpensive actions include:    Storing valuable and important items or documents on upper  floors.    Anchoring fuel sources.    Sealing cracks in the foundation and around doors and windows.    Installing backflow valves on basement floor drains, washing  machine drains, toilets and sink drains.    Installing a sump pump.  When making improvements to your home, consider the following:    Tiled floors with waterproof adhesive and grout.    Flood-resistant exterior doors.    Raising electrical sockets on the first floor.    Flood-resistant drywall.    Moving large appliances, furnaces, hot water heaters and  electrical panels out of the basement or ground floor and above  the FCL. Alternatively, use risers to keep them off the floor.    Permeable paving surfaces for sidewalks and driveways.    Installing permanent safeguards, such as self-closing flood  barriers, designed to keep water out of your home for as long as  possible.    Sentimental and important items  kept upstairs  Raised appliances  Wall mounted television  Valuable items on high shelf  Hot water tank moved to  upper floor  Fridge on raised base  Flood resistent drywall  Raised electrical sockets  Tiled floors with waterproof  adhesive and grout  Sump pump to remove  water  Non-return valve in  sewer pipe  Permeable paving  surfaces  Flood resistent  front door  A D V I C E  F O R  P R O T E C T I N G  Y O U R  H O M E  A N D  P R O P E R T Y  5  Things you can do to the exterior of your home:    Enhance landscaping so water drains away from the foundation.    Ensure water from downspouts drains away from your residence.    Clean your gutters regularly.    Maintain your perimeter drains regularly.    Keep nearby storm drains clear of debris.  Check with your insurance representative to determine if sewer backup  and/or residential flood insurance is available for your property. You  can also contact the Insurance Bureau of Canada at 1-844-227-5422 for  information regarding home insurance.

Make sure you have enough sand, burlap  or plastic bags, shovels and time to properly prepare. Contact your local  government for information on obtaining sandbags.    Locate the sandbag dike  on high ground as close as  possible to your home.    Dig a bonding trench, one  sack deep by two sacks wide.    Alternate direction of  sacks with bottom layer  (e.g. bottom layer length- wise with dike, next layer  crosswise.    Sacks should be  approximately half-filled with  clay, silt or sand.    Tying or sewing of sacks is  not necessary.    Lap unfilled portion under  next sack.    Press firmly in place.

Visit www.gov.bc.ca/ PreparedBC to download guides and plans that will help you:    Put together an emergency kit.    Develop a household emergency plan.    Connect with your neighbours.  First Aid kit and  medications  Battery-powered  or hand crank  radio  Battery-powered  or hand crank  flashlight with  extra batteries  Whistle to signal  for help  Cell phone with  chargers, inverter  or solar charger  Copy of your emergency  plan, copies of  important documents  and cash in small bills  At least a three- day supply of  non-perishable  food. Manual can  opener for cans  Garbage bags,  moist towelettes  and plastic ties  for personal  sanitation  Water, four litres per  person per day, for three  days to one week, for  drinking and sanitation  Dust mask  to help filter  contaminated air  Seasonal clothing  and footwear  http://www.gov.bc.ca/PreparedBC http://www.gov.bc.ca/PreparedBC   A D V I C E  F O R  P R O T E C T I N G  Y O U R  H O M E  A N D  P R O P E R T Y  PreparedBC  8  If you are facing imminent flooding, move electrical appliances to upper  floors and make sure to anchor fuel supplies, such as oil tanks. Tune in  to local radio and TV channels for information on sandbagging stations,  possible evacuation procedures and reception centres.  Never attempt to drive or walk in flood water. A mere six inches of fast- moving water can knock over an adult. Two feet of rushing water can  carry away most vehicles, including SUVs and pick-up trucks.  If directed to evacuate    Gather your grab-and-go kit(s).    Follow instructions from local officials via TV, radio or social  media.    Move to a safe location outside the impacted area.    Return home only when authorities say it is safe to do so.

While cleaning up you should:     Be aware of areas where floodwaters have receded, keeping an  eye out for debris.     Be aware that floodwaters often erode roads and walkways,  making them less stable.    Never drive through areas that are still flooded.    Avoid standing water as it may be electrically charged from  underground or downed power lines.    Photograph damage to your property and speak to your  insurance agent.
