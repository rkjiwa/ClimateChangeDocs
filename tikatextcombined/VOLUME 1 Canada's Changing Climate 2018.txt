dramatically.  How global warming will affect the climate and weather  patterns across Canada is complicated by the vast landscapes that comprise our nation, and the complex array of  direct and indirect effects that are already anticipated.  Our uncertain future should compel professionals and  decision-makers to be better informed and more capable of making effective and insightful decisions.    Our hope for a stable and sustainable future action requires action be taken today. Whether the goal is to reduce  the emissions that are warming the planet, or to prepare society for anticipated changes, efforts towards  mitigation and adaptation must begin now.  Everyone is responsible, everyone needs to act.     The PRIMERs are provided in a four-volume set.  PRIMER ONE summarizes the science on climate weather and  change.  PRIMER TWO provides information on how individuals, communities and organizations can begin now to  prepare for anticipated changes.  PRIMER THREE presents planning and design tools, existing and emerging, that  can help in the creation of resilient and prosperous communities and sustainable ecosystems.  PRIMER FOUR  summarizes approaches and tools focused on one of the fastest emerging challenges – rising water levels.     The Primers are intended to augment your basic understanding of the science on global warming and climate  change, to provide improved access to information on anticipated impacts to Canadian landscapes, and to promote  improved understanding of the options available to society through adaptive planning for change.  Should you wish  to expand your understanding on the topics discussed, access the materials referenced in the Additional Readings  and Resources on the Web, and reach out to do your own search for newer information.  Climate adaptation is a  rapidly evolving knowledge area.    The Primers rely on two categories of information: reports and papers that have been freely distributed on the  internet; and a selection of books and peer-reviewed papers.  Many of the reports and books referenced are  available from public or university libraries.  Should the URLs provided for material available on the internet  become inactive, it could mean only that the material has been moved, not that it is outdated or no longer relevant.   We encourage you to search by author and/or title to find the document.     Peer reviewed papers are included here because they are an important source of information on climate change  science, mitigation and adaptation, and the first access point for new knowledge.  Some journal papers are  provided freely on the Internet.  Unfortunately, digital access to other journals requires paid subscriptions, or  individual papers can be purchased on-line.  Most university libraries in Canada provide memberships to the public  for a nominal annual fee, but not all may include access to online journals.  However, in addition to borrowing  texts, hard and/or electronic copies of many journals can be viewed at the library.  Readers can also become  members of local, regional, or national communities of practice, where enrollment and access to many valuable  sources of information are freely provided.         PRIMER ONE:    CLIMATE, WEATHER AND CHANGE   Chapters One and Two provide users with a   summary of the current science on global warming,   and the current and projected future changes in   weather and climate throughout Canada.  Chapter   Three summarizes current thinking on the effects   anticipated environmental change will have on   ecosystems, on society and on local as well as   regional economics.     PRIMER TWO:    PREPARING FOR CHANGE   Chapter Four focusses on managing risk and   understanding the role played in decision-making   by uncertainty.  Chapter Five outlines the need to   change what we do, to mitigate and to adapt.    Chapter Six provides direction for those seeking a   better future, incorporating existing instruments   and tools with emerging principles and processes   for guiding change.   PRIMER THREE:   CREATING RESILIENT COMMUNITIES   Chapter Seven summarizes opportunities to create   resilient communities that integrate with their   natural environment and promote well being and   sustainability for humans and ecosystems.    PRIMER FOUR:   FACING RISING WATERS   Chapter Eight examines preventative and protective   measures to rising water, whether it is fresh water   (overland flooding) or the result of rising sea levels   and/or storm surges.       2 | P a g e    1 CLIMATE, WEATHER AND CHANGE  1.1. GLOBAL WARMING – THE BASICS   Warming of the planet’s atmosphere has been monitored for over thirty years by scientists and  agencies throughout the world.  Decades of research have confirmed that changes in the  composition of atmospheric gases are increasing average temperatures across the planet.  That  warming trend is already affecting the climate system (Figure 1-1) through changes in short  term weather patterns, seasonal norms, and periods of extreme temperature.  The Synthesis  Report (SYR) of the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate  Change (IPCC 2014a) confirms that:   “human influence on the climate system is clear and growing, with impacts observed across all  continents and oceans. Many of the observed changes since the 1950s are unprecedented over  decades to millennia. The IPCC is now 95 percent certain that humans are the main cause of  current global warming.  In addition, the SYR finds that the more human activities disrupt the  climate, the greater the risks of severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and  ecosystems, and long-lasting changes in all components of the climate system.” (IPCC 2014a  Synthesis Report, p v).   The IPCC has developed thousands of pages of information that document the changes already  experienced and the changes anticipated as the planet warms. Canadian scientists have  contributed to these publications, and continue in their efforts to apply global science to  understanding climate change in this country         The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is the leading   international body for the assessment of climate change. Established in 1988 by   the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World   Meteorological Organization (WMO), the IPCC provides the world with a clear   scientific view on the current state of knowledge in climate change and its   potential environmental and socio-economic impacts. The IPCC is an   intergovernmental body open to all member countries of the United Nations   (UN) and WMO. Currently 195 countries are members of the IPCC. They   participate in the review process and the plenary Sessions, where decisions   about the work of the IPCC are taken, and reports are accepted, adopted and   approved.   The IPCC reviews and assesses the most recent scientific, technical and socio-  economic information produced worldwide relevant to the understanding of   climate change.  It does not conduct research, nor does it monitor climate   related data or parameters. Thousands of scientists from all over the world   contribute to the work of the IPCC on a voluntary basis.     Because of its combined scientific and intergovernmental structure, the IPCC   embodies a unique opportunity to provide rigorous and balanced scientific   information to decision makers.  By endorsing the IPCC reports, governments   acknowledge the authority of their scientific content. The work of the   organization is policy-relevant and yet policy-neutral, never policy-prescriptive.     Adapted from: https://www.ipcc.ch/organization/organization.shtml    CLIMATE CHANGE refers to a change in the state of the climate that can be identified   (e.g., by using statistical tests) by changes in the mean and/or the variability of its   properties, and that persists for an extended period, typically decades or longer.    Climate change may be due to natural internal processes or external forcings such as   modulations of the solar cycles, volcanic eruptions, and persistent anthropogenic   changes in the composition of the atmosphere or in land use.   https://www.ipcc.ch/organization/organization.shtml   3 | P a g e       FIGURE 1-1:  The major natural and anthropomorphic processes and influences that affect the earth’s climate system.

Visualizations convey a great deal of information in a  short period of time, and when based on excellent  science can be useful tools for communicating the  urgency for emission reductions (Figures 1-2 and 1-3).

FIGURE 1-2:  The Climate Atlas of Canada is an   interactive tool to aid users in understanding climate   change in Canada.  The Atlas combines climate science,   mapping and storytelling to better inform Canadians of   the effects of global warming here at home (Available at:   https://climateatlas.ca/about-atlas).    https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/4252 https://climateatlas.ca/about-atlas   5 | P a g e    1.2 GREENHOUSE GASES   Over the past 200 years, the primary source of human contributions of greenhouse gases to  the atmosphere has been from the burning of fossil fuels (about 78% in the period 1970-2010)  (IPCC 2014a).  As atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) increase, the surface  of the earth becomes warmer – often referred to as the enhanced greenhouse effect (Figure  1-4).  After 2035, if emissions of greenhouse gases do not decrease, the mean temperature  change is likely to exceed 2 C° by 2100, and to continue increasing thereafter (Figure 1-5) (IPCC  2014a).     IPCC scientists have concluded that, in comparison to mean global temperatures experienced  in the period 1986-2005, the average change in global temperature projected for the period  2016 to 2035 is somewhat conservatively in the range of 0.3 to 0.7 °C.  Scientists are  increasingly concerned that a change of 2 C° in the Earth’s mean temperature is the most that  could be accommodated if we are to maintain the planet at conditions close to what we have  now.                     FIGURE 1-4:  Global land and ocean   temperature anomalies between 1880-2014,   relative to the 20th century average.  While   temperatures were colder between 1880 and   1940, since the late 1970s, temperatures have   been warmer, with 2014 the warmest year on   record during this period (Image Credit;   USA/NOAA.  Available at   https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cag/global/time-  series ; and as presented in GOV/CAN/ECCC.   2015. Available at:   http://www.ec.gc.ca/sc-  cs/Default.asp?lang=En&n=A5F83C26-1 ).   GREENHOUSE GASES (GHGs)   Greenhouse gases are those gaseous constituents of the atmosphere,   both natural and anthropogenic, that absorb and emit radiation at   specific wavelengths within the spectrum of terrestrial radiation   emitted by the Earth’s surface, the atmosphere itself, and clouds. This   property causes the greenhouse effect (global warming).    Water vapor (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), methane   (CH4), and ozone (O3) are the primary greenhouse gases in the Earth’s   atmosphere.     Greenhouse gases also include halocarbons and other chlorine and   bromine-containing substances, sulfur hexafluoride (SF6),   hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), and perfluorocarbons (PFCs).     https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cag/global/time-series https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cag/global/time-series http://www.ec.gc.ca/sc-cs/Default.asp?lang=En&n=A5F83C26-1 http://www.ec.gc.ca/sc-cs/Default.asp?lang=En&n=A5F83C26-1   6 | P a g e    Despite the growing data on how the planet was  warming, and the warnings from scientists on the  consequences of climate change on ecosystems and  on society, emissions of GHGs continued to rise over  the period 1970-2010, reaching the highest levels in  human history from 2000 to 2010 (IPCC 2014a).     The main drivers for increasing GHG emissions are  population growth and economic growth.  While  population growth continued to rise at roughly the  same rate, economic growth has risen sharply.   Consequently, and despite efforts by some nations  and sectors to reduce emissions, total emissions of  greenhouse gases to the atmosphere have also  continued to grow.                    “Surface temperature is projected to rise   over the 21st century under all assessed   emission scenarios. It is very likely that   heat waves will occur more often and last   longer, and that extreme precipitation   events will become more intense and   frequent in many regions. The ocean will   continue to warm and acidify, and global   mean sea level to rise.” IPCC 2014a, page10   GREENHOUSE GAS SOURCES:    Human contributions of carbon dioxide are   produced largely through the processing and   consumption of fossil fuels.     Methane is emitted when vegetation is burned,   digested or rotted in the absence of oxygen, or   from activities such as cattle and rice farming,   solid waste disposal, and in the production of oil   and gas    Nitrous oxide is released by chemical fertilizers   and in the burning of fossil fuels.     FIGURE 1-5:  Global mean surface temperature as a function of cumulative total global emissions of greenhouse gases (Figure   SPM.10, p 26 from IPCC 2013).    “Continued emissions of greenhouse   gases will cause further warming and   will increase the scope and severity of   change in all components of the   global climate system” (IPCC 2014a).     7 | P a g e    As reported by the IPCC (2014b), the largest share of global anthropogenic emissions of  greenhouse gases to the atmosphere is contributed by a small number of countries.  Canada  ranks within the top ten, when LUCF (land use change and forestry) is included in the  calculations (Figure 1-6) (World Resources Institute 2015).  Based on international data, in 2010  Canada’s contribution to carbon dioxide emissions from fuel consumption was only 1.8% of  total global emissions.  Compared to the total loadings of nations such as China and the United  States, Canada’s contribution to global emissions is relatively low.  However, when Canadian  emissions of greenhouse gases are calculated as per capita loadings, we rank #1 in the world,  a clear indication on why we should be more concerned over our influence on changing global  conditions (Figure 1-7).     It is also important to note that expectations for declines in the percentage of Canada’s  contributions to global CO2, may not be the result only of reductions in Canadian emissions but  may be based on Canada achieving a lower percentage of the world’s emissions based on  anticipated rapid growth in emissions from developing countries such as China and India.   Over the period from 1990 to 2014, total emissions of greenhouse gases in Canada grew by  20% (Figure 1-8) (GOV/CAN/ECCC 2016) (Table 1-1).  There was a net growth of 23% in Energy  sector emissions, largely attributable to the extraction of bitumen and synthetic crude oil from  Canada’s oil sands.  These increases are consistent with a 91% increase in production of crude  oil and natural gas over the period, largely for export                FIGURE 1-6:  The top ten nations in annual emissions of greenhouse gases   in 2011 (World Resources Institute 2015).   FIGURE 1-7:  How the top ten emitters rank in terms of per capita emissions of   greenhouse gases (World Resources Institute 2015).   TABLE 1-1:  Global warming potentials for carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide    (adapted from IPCC 2013)   LU⁰F refers to those changes in atmospheric levels of all greenhouse gases that are   attributable to changes in land use and forest cover, including activities such as: decreases   or increases in biomass stocks due to forest management, logging, fuelwood collection,   etc.; conversion of existing forests and natural grasslands to other land uses; the   abandonment of formerly managed lands (e.g. croplands and pastures); and emissions and   removals of CO2 in soil associated with land-use change and management.

Of these three, carbon dioxide gets the most attention in popular  literature, but the effects of methane and nitrous oxide cannot be ignored,  and the differences between the three gases have important effects in how  they influence ongoing warming trends.  Carbon dioxide is arguably the most  impactful over the long term, due to its complex lifecycle in the atmosphere;  CO2 is absorbed and sequestered by the environment in many varying ways,  with the result that 60-80% of carbon dioxide emissions will be sequestered  within 200 years, but the remaining 20-40% may remain in the atmosphere  for thousands of years more (Archer et al. 2009).     Methane and nitrous oxide both have simpler chemical reabsorption processes, over  much shorter time frames, but their contribution to warming while they remain in the  atmosphere is significantly higher than that of carbon dioxide over the short term of  the next decade or century respectively, for equal proportions of each gas (IPCC 2013).   This can be quantified by measures such as the Global Warming Potential (GWP) of  each gas, as seen in Table 1-1.  This measures the relative warming potential of each  greenhouse gas, relatively to carbon dioxide’s warming effect, over a given period of  time.  In terms of current warming trends, the vast majority of warming can be  attributed to the effects of these three gases.  There are other gases which can also  contribute to warming in the same manner, but their emissions rates are low enough  that they are not currently major influences.  As emissions rates change, however, this  may change, and tracking these emissions patterns over time is critical.   FIGURE 1-8:  Trends in Canada’s greenhouse gas emissions by IPCC sector (1990-2014) (GOV/CAN/ECCC   2016).     9 | P a g e    1.3 THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CLIMATE AND WEATHER   The difference between climate and weather is largely a matter of the time  over which conditions are recorded.  WEATHER records report on conditions  in the atmosphere over a relatively short period of time, such as a week, a  season or even a decade.  Changes in weather patterns across North America  can be affected by global events such as seasonal changes in the jet stream,  as well as sporadic events such as volcanic eruptions that contribute  particulates to the atmosphere, resulting in short-term surface cooling that  can last for several years.  Natural variations in Pacific oceanic circulation  patterns can affect sea temperatures and result in significant regional shifts  in air temperature and precipitation patterns (e.g., El Niño, La Niña)  (GOV/USA/NAS 2014, 2016).  Natural variations in weather patterns often  result in some decades being record as ‘more stormy’, ‘drier or wetter’,  ‘warmer or colder’ than others, but only the weather, not the climate has  changed.     CLIMATE is the average weather for a region based on data collected over a  period of 30 or more years.  Climate is best understood as the kind of weather  that can reasonably be expected in an area at a designated time of the year.   By example, winters can be expected to be snowy throughout much of  Canada, and summers warmer.  Climate is what you expect – a warm  summer.  Weather is what you get – a hot day with thunder storms.  When  comparing changes in anticipated weather, such as the frequency and  intensity of extreme storm events, scientists require a lengthy data record  before they can conclude that a changing climate is now characterized by  storms that are more severe or happening more often.   On a global scale, the scientists of the IPCC have in their most recent  assessments (IPCC 2014a) become increasingly confident that anomalies in  weather systems across the planet are most likely the result of global  warming.  In Canada and elsewhere climate scientists can yet be reluctant to  assign causality for recent extremes in air temperature and severe storm  events to human induced changes in climate (Herring et al., 2015).   Confidence in the attribution of specific extreme events to anthropogenic  climate change is highest for extreme heat and cold events, followed by  hydrological drought and heavy precipitation (GOV/USA/NAS 2016).         CHANGES IN GLOBAL WEATHER EVENTS-   “Changes in many extreme weather and climate events have been observed since about   1950.  It is very likely that the number of cold days and nights has decreased and the   number of warm days and nights has increased on the global scale. It is likely that the   frequency of heat waves has increased in large parts of Europe, Asia and Australia. There   are likely more land regions where the number of heavy precipitation events has   increased than where it has decreased. The frequency or intensity of heavy precipitation   events has likely increased in North America and Europe.”  IPCC 2013, p5   CLIMATE AND WEATHER   CLIMATE is the pattern of weather measured over decades.    WEATHER is what’s happening outside the door right now; today.   FIGURE 1-9: Neil deGrasse Tyson, scientist and former host of NOVA, breaks down the differences   between weather and climate change in a National Geographic Channel podcast (available at    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBdxDFpDp_k ).   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBdxDFpDp_k   10 | P a g e    1.4 HOW WEATHER MAY CHANGE   The IPCC (2014a) projects that global weather will alter as climate change progresses,  anticipating more severe weather events, prolonged periods of precipitation and drought, and  more frequent extreme hot and extreme cold days.  On any day in any location throughout the  world, environmental conditions are complicated by geography, which can make accurate  prediction of the scope and pace of changes in weather difficult.  As the world warms,  expectations for ‘normal’ weather may become less plausible.  The warming climate will  contribute to changes in anticipated frequency and expected extremes in temperature,  precipitation, and severe weather events.  By example, the Government of Canada has  projected that the number of extreme hot days (Figure 1-10) (GOV/CAN/Health 2011) and the  associated potential for wild fires (Figure 1-11) (Hengeveld et al., 2005) will increase across the  country as the atmosphere warms.                HOW DOES GLOBAL WARMING MAKE IT COLDER?    Warming trends are essentially an increase in the amount of energy   contributing to weather dynamics around the globe.  The result is,   broadly speaking, less consistent weather outcomes, resulting in not   just a slow and steady average increase in global temperatures, but   also greater extremes in terms of both hot and cold days.  The same   holds true of other weather outcomes, such as wind strength and   precipitation patterns.  While a particular weather pattern may result   in unseasonably cold temperatures in one area, global temperatures   overall are still warming steadily.  In short, steady warming also   increases volatility around that rising average.

The current situation on atmospheric conditions is unique in history.   Scientists are working apace to understand the causative factors and  ramifications of the changes that are already upon us, as well as the changes  that will come (Table 1-2).  However, reliable prediction of the consequences  of escalating global warming on the world’s environments can be  challenging, because human society has never experienced these changes to  normal conditions, making the future essentially unknowable.

Across the globe there are more heat waves, seas are rising, and erratic  weather is creating havoc.  Canada’s climate is also changing.  For more than sixty years, scientists have observed  a general warming trend in air temperatures (Figure 2-1), averaging an increase of 1.5 C° between 1950 and 2010  (Warren and Lemmen 2014) (Figure 2-2).  All of Canada is projected to get warmer in the future (Figure 2-3).  When  compared to warming trends throughout the world, Canadian environments (especially in the North) appear to be  warming at a rate that is approximately double the reported global average (Hartmann et al. 2013).                    FIGURE 2-1: Warming trends in Canada from   1948-2012 (GOV/CAN/ECCC 2015).   FIGURE 2-2: Annual mean temperature change   for Canada (°C), 1950–2010, relative to the 1961–  1990 average (represented by zero on the Y-axis)   (Warren and Lemmen 2014).   CANADA IN A CHANGING CLIMATE:    KEY MESSAGES   Warming over the 20th century is indisputable and   largely due to human activities.   • Canada’s rate of warming is about twice the global   rate: a 2ºC increase globally means a 3 to 4ºC increase   for Canada.   • Effects will persist for centuries because greenhouse   gases (GHGs) are long-lived and the oceans are   warming.   • Cumulative CO2 emissions largely determine ultimate   warming. A 2ºC warming target may still be   attainable, but we are already 65% of the way to   carbon concentrations that would result in a 2ºC shift.    • GHG emissions need to become net zero in order to   stabilize climate at any temperature.   • Canada’s climate is already changing, with observed   changes in air temperature, precipitation, snow and   ice cover and other indicators. Further changes in   climate are inevitable.   • Changes in climate are increasingly affecting Canada’s   natural environment, economic sectors and the health   of Canadians.   • Extreme weather events are a key concern for Canada   and there is growing confidence that some types of   extreme events will increase in frequency and/or   intensity as the climate continues to warm.”   (Extracted from GOV/CAN/ECCC 2015 and Warren and   Lemmen et al. 2014).        17 | P a g e                                      FIGURE 2-3: Projected change in mean January temperatures in Canada (Source: Prairie Climate Centre.

Reductions in the coverage of winter sea ice have also been noted in more southern areas, such as the Gulf of St.  Lawrence.  Snowfall has decreased in the south, sometimes associated with earlier onset of spring melts, and with  shrinkage in the areal extent of glaciers.  During this same period (1950-2010), most areas in Canada have generally  become wetter (Figures 2-5, 2-6).  Annual average precipitation has increased in many areas, but changes in  precipitation trends are less consistent across the country than the trends towards increasing temperatures.   New projections from the Prairie Climate Centre demonstrate how precipitation patterns are expected to change   across the country during spring and summer (Figure 2-7).             FIGURE 2-4: Trends in Arctic sea ice extent over the period   1979–2012 shown as time series of the percentage difference   in ice extent in March and September relative to the mean   values for the period 1979–2000. Both trends are statistically   significant (Warren and Lemmen 2014).   FIGURE 2-5: Patterns of change in annual total precipitation   over the period 1950–2010.

The Climate Atlas of Canada combines climate science, mapping and storytelling to bring the global issue   of climate change closer to home for Canadians. It is designed to inspire local, regional, and national action   that will let us move from risk to resilience.    In a series of papers and videos, the Climate Atlas provides up to date information on changes in weather   and climate already occurring or anticipated to occur throughout Canada.  The Atlas is a unique source for   information specific to local areas throughout the country.     https://climateatlas.ca    http://prairieclimatecentre.ca/2017/10/new-map-series-highlights-changes-coming-to-canadas-climate/ http://prairieclimatecentre.ca/2017/10/new-map-series-highlights-changes-coming-to-canadas-climate/ https://climateatlas.ca/   20 | P a g e    TABLE 2-1:  A synopsis of some of the recorded and/or anticipated environmental changes in Canada.  The intensity of projected changes will depend on the climate change scenarios chosen but will   be greater for those scenarios that have assumed continuing global high emissions of greenhouse gases (Adapted from information provided in Warren and Lemmen 2014, with material from additional   sources).   PARAMETER ALREADY OBSERVED CHANGES PROJECTED CHANGES   TEMPERATURE     Seasonal temperature  Data since 1948 show predominant warming trends in every season, but these   trends are most severe in the winter and spring, and particularly in the   northern regions (Hengeveld et al., 2005).   Warming will be greatest in winter, especially in northern Canada. In summer, the   largest increases are projected for southern Canada and the central interior.    Extremes in daily   temperature   Since 1950 the frequency of hot days (the highest 10% of daily maximum   temperatures) in summer has increased and the frequency of cold nights (the   lowest 10% of daily minimum temperatures) in winter has decreased nationally   since 1950.   Increases in the frequency and magnitude of unusually warm days and nights and   decreases for unusually cold days and nights are projected to occur throughout the   21st century.   Long duration hot events Overall, across Canada, there has been increasing trends of warmer days and   nights, combined with declining trends of cooler days and nights, the   combination of which amounts to an increasing tendency towards heat waves   (Vincent and Mekis 2006).   The length, frequency and/or intensity of warm spells, including heat waves, are   projected to increase over most land areas.   Rare hot extremes  In 2014, the Northwest Territories and British Columbia experienced a range   of hot extremes during spring and summer, some of which had not been   recorded in over 100 years (Blunden and Arndt 2015).   Rare hot extremes are currently projected to become more frequent. For example, by   mid-century a one-in-20-year extreme hot day is projected to become about a one-  in-5 year event over most of Canada    PRECIPITATION AND HYDROLOGICAL INDICATORS   Seasonal precipitation  Canada has generally become wetter in recent decades, and some southern   regions have observed less snowfall and more rainfall. .   Increases in precipitation are projected for most of Canada in all seasons, with the   exception of parts of southern Canada where precipitation in summer and fall is   expected to decline,   Heavy precipitation  To date, while precipitation rates have generally been on the rise across   Canada, the prevalence of heavy or extreme precipitation events has not   followed the same trend, showing only a marginal national increase over the   same period (Vincent and Mekis 2006).   Over most of Canada, extreme precipitation events are projected to double in   frequency by mid-century.   Streamflow Much of southern Canada experienced lower maximum and lower minimum   river flows over the period 1970-2005. Parts of the North (e.g., western   Nunavut, Northwest Territories, Yukon and northern British Columbia) have   recorded increases in minimum flows.   Increases in winter streamflow are projected for many parts of southern Canada. Mean   annual streamflow is anticipated to decrease in areas of Alberta and Saskatchewan,   while projections for other regions vary across different climate scenarios   SNOW COVER   Snow cover duration  Over the Canadian land mass, there has been a declining trend in the area of   snow cover during the spring, with the largest changes reported in northern   areas in June.    Widespread decreases in the duration of snow cover are projected across the   Northern Hemisphere with the largest changes occurring in maritime mountain   regions, such as British Columbia.   Snow depth In the last 60 years, snow fall has declined throughout most of southern   Canada, and increased in the north.    Maximum snow accumulation over high latitudes in the north is projected to increase.   PERMAFROST   Ground temperature Permafrost temperatures as measured across the North have increased in the   last 20 to 30 years.   Warming of the permafrost is projected to continue at rates surpassing those   observed to date, however for much of the colder areas of permafrost in the Arctic it   will take decades to centuries to completely thaw (Segal et al. 2016)        21 | P a g e          PARAMETER ALREADY OBSERVED CHANGES PROJECTED CHANGES   SEA LEVEL     Global sea-level rise Between 1880 and 2012, average global sea levels rose about 21 cm (averaging   1.6 mm year).   Estimates of future changes in global sea level (by 2100) range from a few tens of   centimetres to more than a metre, depending on local conditions.  Global sea-level   rise after 2100 is expected to continue during the coming centuries and millennia, and   may eventually amount to several metres.   Relative sea-level rise in   Canada   (refer to Chapter 2.5 for   more information)   In parts of Canada, land subsidence (e.g., parts of Atlantic Canada) and land   rising (e.g. parts of the north) have for hundreds of years contributed to   changes in sea levels. Relative sea-level rise of over 3 mm/year has been   observed on coastlines of Atlantic Canada and the Beaufort Sea coast, with   lower amounts along Pacific coastlines. Relative sea level fall of 10 mm/year   has been observed around Hudson Bay where the land is rising rapidly due to   post-glacial rebound.   Sea levels along Canadian coastlines will continue to be influenced by land uplift and   subsidence as well as by changes in global sea levels. Where the land is rising, it will   temper rising sea levels.  In some areas where sea levels have been falling, the trend   may reverse.  Where the land is subsiding, it will contribute to increases in the rate for   rising sea levels.   OCEAN CLIMATE    Long-term observations have recorded increasing ocean temperatures and   acidity in all three of Canada’s oceans. Long-term decreases in subsurface   dissolved oxygen levels have also been observed in the Atlantic and Pacific   oceans off Canada.   Warming trends will continue, particularly with regards to surface waters, although   warming trends in deeper waters are also present and will lead to much longer-term   consequences.  As well, due to changes in the global water cycle, salinity in Canada’s   three oceans is expected to significantly decrease over the next century, to a greater   extent than oceans surrounding most other nations (IPCC 2013).   ICE COVER   Arctic summer sea ice End-of-summer minimum ice extent has declined at a rate of 13% per decade   over 1979-2012, while maximum winter sea ice extent has declined at a rate of   2.6% per decade.  Declines in winter sea ice extent have also been observed in   the Labrador-Newfoundland and Gulf of St. Lawrence region.  Sea ice in the   Arctic has also been shifting from dominated by thicker multi-year ice, to   increasing areas of thinner, single year ice.    A nearly ice-free summer is considered a strong possibility for the Arctic Ocean by the   middle of the century although summer sea ice may persist longer in the Canadian   Arctic Archipelago region.   Lake and River Ice Since the mid-20th century, trends towards earlier ice-free dates (lakes) and  ice break-up dates (rivers) have been observed for most of the country but are   particularly evident in Western Canada.   With the continued advance of ice cover break-up dates and delays in ice-cover freeze   up, ice cover duration is expected to decrease by up to a month by mid-century.   GLACIERS   Glacier mass – Yukon, British   Columbia, Alberta   Western Cordilleran glaciers are losing mass and shrinking rapidly to the   smallest extents in several millennia.   The volume of glacier ice in western Canada is projected to shrink by 70% by 2100,   with the greatest loss occurring between 2020-2040.  Maritime glaciers in the British   Columbia Rockies will survive but in a diminished state (Clarke et al. 2015).   Glacier mass – High Arctic Arctic glaciers have been losing mass since the early 1960s. Since 2005, the   rate of mass loss for glaciers throughout the High Arctic has increased sharply   in direct response to warmer regional summer temperatures.   Projections for future glacier volume loss by 2100 estimate that the Canadian Arctic   region will be the world leader in this category, seeing greater loss of mass than any   other region (Radic et al. 2013).        22 | P a g e    2.2 CHANGES IN AIR TEMPERATURE AND SEASONALITY    Global temperatures have already increased from pre- industrial records, with 2015 recorded as the warmest year  on record.  Throughout much of Canada climate change is  expected to raise mean annual temperatures, a situation  that may be slightly tempered in coastal areas by proximity  to the oceans.  In addition to changes to both mean and  extreme seasonal air temperatures, there is potential for the  timing of seasons to alter.  Some areas may experience a  form of weather whiplash arising when there are rapid and  extreme shifts in weather from one season to the next.   Changes in the number of expected days per year of extreme  heat or cold will challenge existing infrastructure and energy  grids and pose risks to human well-being (CPHA 2015;  GOV/CAN/Health; GOV/CAN/ON 2016).    Warming air temperatures will also affect water chemistry,  resulting in increased acidification and decreased oxygen  and knock-on impacts to fecundity, growth, and predator- prey relationships of species in freshwater, terrestrial and  marine ecosystems (Figure 2-8).  Species that are less able to  accommodate to changing conditions, and invading species  that are better able to flourish under the new regimes, will  compete for habitat, with some species changing in range  and in population.     Changes in temperature and seasonality will affect resource  sectors such as fisheries, forestry, and agriculture, some  negatively, others positively.  Tourism in some areas may  benefit from longer warmer weather, but winter-based sport  and recreation could also suffer.  Demands on the energy  sector will likely increase, relative to the need for heat and  for air conditioning, especially in areas that previously did  not need cooling technologies.             FIGURE 2-8:  Human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels, and deforestation lead to increased concentrations of   greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.  Subsequent global warming results in is a range of physical and chemical changes   in the oceans, some of which (e.g., upwelling) are as yet not understood (Adapted from Harley et al. 2006, p. 230).        23 | P a g e    2.3 CHANGES IN ICE COVER    In Canada’s North, and on mountain ranges throughout the country, there is a growing concern over the effects of  continued warming of planetary and oceanic temperatures on multi-year ice such as sea ice and glaciers.  Glaciers  will melt, and sea and lake ice cover will be reduced, changing evaporation and run-off patterns, and affecting the  timing of spring flushes (Ford et al. 2016; Lemmen et al. 2008).  However, across Canada, changes in ice cover on  the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence seaway, on near shore coastal waters, and in the thousands of lakes, rivers and  wetlands of the nation, will also have physical, chemical, biological and economic consequences.    In the North reduced surface coverage, coupled with the thinning of polar sea ice, is reducing cover and habitats  for marine species (e.g., polar bears), and increasing risks to First Nations hunters and fishers as they seek  important sources of ‘country food’.  As ice cover changes in extent and thickness, the breeding, feeding and  migration patterns of other species will be affected.     In the North and on more southern mountains, glacial melt has already accelerated, with some glaciers expected  to vanish by as early as 2100 (Figure 2-9).  Changes in glacial melt quantities and timing will affect downstream  conditions in rivers and lakes in British Columbia important to salmon breeding, rearing and migration.  Increased  water temperatures, coupled with lower volumes pose threats to the continuing viability of these and other  aquatic species, and to the communities who are dependent on these resources.     Changes in the extent and thickness of ice cover on lakes, rivers and oceans will have widespread effects on  shorelines across the nation.  Areas more used to the shore protection offered by winter ice cover will now face  increased erosion and sedimentation from storm waves and nearshore currents.  In other areas, ice breakup will  contribute to erosion of shorelines, especially in Northern areas when loss of ice cover is coupled with thawing  permafrost and destabilizing soils.     Along the Great Lakes, winters with more ice cover than normal will reduce evaporation but affect migratory bird  patterns and may result in later springs and cooler temperatures.  During warmer than usual winters, evaporation  from exposed water will contribute to higher rain and snowfall.                    SEA ICE AND WARMER WATER   Reduction in sea ice in the North and in the Gulf   of St. Lawrence will increase wind and wave   erosion on shorelines.  Coastal areas in the   southern Atlantic region that are already   experiencing crustal subsidence will be more   severely affected by rising sea levels.  Rising sea   temperatures and oceanic acidification will affect   lifecycles in shellfish and sea corals.  Salt marshes,   trapped between rising seas and the shoreline,   may experience significant loss in area and   productivity.  Summer tourism could benefit from   warming temperatures but could also be   negatively affected by increasing storminess.    ICE COVER IN THE GREAT LAKES   In some years, ice will cover the surfaces of some   of the Great Lakes, reducing evaporation, but   contributing to later springs.  In years when   temperatures remain higher and the lake surfaces   do not freeze, evaporation can lead to heavier   snow conditions.    FIGURE 2-9: Projected deglaciation to 2100 in the   Columbia Icefield in Western Canada (based on   continuing high global emissions of CO2 (Clarke et al.   2015, used with permission).   COUNTRY FOOD refers to the traditional food of   the Inuit (e.g., arctic char, seal meat, whale,   caribou, etc.).  Originally consumed for day to day   survival, country foods now connect families and   community and are best shared.  Country food   can also be an important food source in remote   areas.      24 | P a g e    2.4 CHANGES IN STORM INTENSITY AND IN RETURN PERIODS   For planning and design professionals, as well as other decision-makers, changes in weather patterns become  important when they affect minimal standards for construction, and when they alter the anticipated return periods  of major precipitation events.  Climate scientists in other northern countries such as the United Kingdom  (Sanderson 2010) have already anticipated changes to expected conditions that can include increased  precipitation, and more heavy precipitation events during winter seasons, and less precipitation, concentrated in  intense downpours from storm events.  In Canada, studies on changes in return periods for extreme conditions  have returned disturbing conclusions.  In Quebec, researchers anticipate that climate change may result in “very  serious increases in the volume of runoff, maximum discharge and water level”, a situation that will become more  drastic as longer return periods are considered and may result in increases of 250% in current maximum water  discharge, and water levels that are considerably higher than current guidelines for flood events (Roy et al. 2001,  p3167).  In British Columbia, peak design discharges are estimated to increase by more than 100% by 2050 (Denault  et al. 2002).     Researchers with Natural Resources Canada (GOV/CAN/NRCan 2008) concluded that by 2100, storm surges (e.g.,  3.6m above mean sea level) in the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence which currently are anticipated to occur once in  every 40 years, will occur every year.  Rising sea levels would produce higher storm surges (i.e., 4.0m-4.22m) that  could occur every 10 to 15 years, even if current conditions for the intensity of storms did not change.                                       Storms are not necessarily getting   stronger, but Canada’s aging infrastructure   (buildings, stormwater systems, seawalls)   are taking more of a beating.    David Phillips, Senior Climatologist, Environment Canada    (as reported in The Canadian Press 2015).      FIGURE 2-10:  Storm surge damage to road, Ferryland NL.    (Image Credit: Natural Resources Canada),     25 | P a g e    2.5  CHANGES ON COASTS AND SHORES   In Canada, and internationally, there have been many long term, principled and sometimes heated debates on  what is included when we refer to the ‘coast’.  Early definitions for the coastal ‘zone’ drew heavily on the tenets  of the international Law of the Sea, reinforcing views of a coast defined by its adjacency to a marine shoreline.  As  a result, early efforts towards a more integrated form of management for coasts relied on landward geospatial  boundaries measured as a (relatively short) distance inland from the shoreline (mean sea level).  Arbitrary  boundaries such as these failed to allow for migratory patterns, for shared ecosystem functions between  watersheds and coastal waters, or for the intricate relationships humans and their settlements have with the coast,  its cultural assets, and its resources.  For Canada, this interpretation also excluded the massive coasts of the Great  Lakes, and other large lake and riverine systems.  In reality, marine and freshwater coasts share more similarities  than they do differences.   To better advance conservation and sustainable management for coastal areas, an increasing number of agencies,  including international organizations, have moved away from the notion that coasts are largely focussed on the  marine environment.  Ecosystem based forms of management, which seek to better understand the linkages  among terrestrial, aquatic and marine environments, rely on a broader interpretation of ‘coast’ to formulate  effective management alternatives for deleterious human activities.     Coasts are best considered as landscapes, comprised of nested terrestrial, aquatic, and marine ecosystems and  human society.  Coastal landscapes include the nearshore water environments, the aquatic systems (lakes, rivers  and marshes) that feed into those receiving waters, and terrestrial environments that may stretch inland as far as  it is necessary to aid understanding and to enhance effective management.  Humans and their communities are  clearly a major component of this landscape.  Coastal communities are  understood to be those settlements that are situated on or near a shoreline,  or that have important cultural and/or economic linkages to the shore and  to larger freshwater or marine environments.  As the climate changes  throughout the world, the effects on coasts in Canada will vary greatly across  the country.  Scientists are working furiously to understand the physical and  chemical changes, to anticipate the effects of these on ecosystem structure  and function, and to best prepare human society for the world to come.         We need to see our coasts as landscapes,   not as lines in the sand.   Canada’s coasts are diverse landscapes   comprised of a complex array of intertwined   components that include:   • terrestrial, aquatic and marine ecosystems   linked through shared spatial, temporal and   functional attributes;   • transition areas or ecotones that bridge these   ecosystems; and   • co-dependent human communities   responsible for both the exploitation and   protection of coastal resources and ecosystems.   Adapted from Mercer Clarke 2010, p143   Image Credit: C. Mercer Clarke  FIGURE 2-11:  Coastal landscapes (Mercer Clarke 2010)        26 | P a g e    Coasts are diverse, changing environments.  Natural processes such as currents, wind and waves, and ice constantly  reshape shorelines, depositing accrued sediments in calmer bays, changing sandy beaches to cobble, and  collapsing bluffs (Figure 2-12). Glaciers carved bays and deposited entrained materials as drumlin islands.  Changing  water levels over time stranded some beaches on land and flooded others.     Canadian coastal landscapes have also been shaped by human activities.  With the arrival of the first European  settlers, large areas of salt marsh throughout what is now Nova Scotia and New Brunswick were dyked and drained  for agriculture.  Forests were harvested for lumber for ship-building and fuel, and farms sprang up all along the  eastern and western shores of the country.  For the past four hundred years, coastal landscapes have altered and  evolved as first farming, then urbanization spread across large expanses of the country.  Shorelines were hardened,  beaches mined for sand and rock, harbours deepened, and backshores paved.  Causeways and bridges disrupted  long shore currents and patterns in erosion and deposition.  Port facilities for the transportation of goods and  services by sea steadily increased throughout the country, extending into Northern areas as regional settlements  expanded and new areas opened to exploitation by the mining and oil and gas sectors.  The coasts of Iqaluit NU,  and Mahone Bay NS, are not the coasts our ancestors knew, nor will they be the coasts our grandchildren rely on.     Throughout Canada, coastal areas and coastal communities will face the same challenges posed by climate change  to inland communities (e.g. extremes of heat and cold, cloud bursts and droughts, and higher and more frequent  floods).  The most readily observable impacts will be to areas vulnerable to inundation from rising sea levels and  higher storm surges.  However, even with the dampening effect of the marine environment, there will be more  extreme heat and cold days, as well as general warming trends throughout the year.  Changes to precipitation  patterns may lead to either floods or droughts in some areas, and alterations to seasonal weather will include  more severe and more frequent storms.  Precipitation changes may also contribute to landslides in some areas,  and to lowering of the groundwater table in others. The total area covered by sea ice in the Arctic and the Gulf of  St. Lawrence will decline, with spring breakups of the ice coming earlier.  Shorelines will change as a result of  instability produced by thawing permafrost, and an increased vulnerability to erosion and sedimentation resulting  from loss of sea ice, higher energy wave conditions, sea-level rise and storm surges (Figure 2-13).  Changes in the  volume, quality and periodicity of riverine inputs, especially those dependent on glacial meltwater, will physically  affect nearshore marine and estuarine environments, resulting in changes to deltas, marshlands, and to beach and  dune complexes.                             FIGURE 2-13:  Coastal erosion on Pelly Island NWT   (Image Credit: NRCan, Whalen Team)   FIGURE 2-12:  Wind and erosion of conifers, Red Point   PE (Image Credit: NRCan)     27 | P a g e    2.5.1 CHANGING SEA LEVELS   To better understand how rising sea levels will affect coastal  areas in Canada, it is important to differentiate between  absolute sea level and relative sea level.     Absolute sea level measures the height of the ocean surface  in relation to the centre of the Earth.  However, just as the  Earth surface is not flat, the surface of the ocean is also not  flat.  In North America, absolute sea levels have been  recorded as higher on the Western coast than on the Eastern  coast.  When reporting changes in Global Sea-level rise, these  changes in absolute sea level refer to an increase that has  been observed in the average Global Sea Level Trend.  Global  Sea Level rise is primarily attributed to changes in the volume  of oceanic water caused by melting glaciers, and thermal  expansion of water because of warming air temperatures.     Relative sea level, which is the more important parameter  for coastal decision-makers, is a local datum derived from  combining the accepted mean sea level (MSL), which is the  average water level (i.e., the midpoint between a mean low  tide and a mean high tide), with local calculations of vertical  land motion (i.e., whether the land mass is rising or falling).     Mean sea level is a vertical datum that serves as a  standardized geodetic reference point used as a chart datum  in bathymetric charts, and in marine and aviation navigation  (mean sea level is a standard against which aircraft  elevations are measured).     Vertical land motion refers to land uplift and land  subsidence.  Throughout much of Canada, vertical land  motion is largely the result of glacial isostatic adjustment or  postglacial rebound, which occurs when the land mass  moves in a delayed response to the advance and retreat of  the continental ice sheets of the last ice age.  Some vertical  land motion may also be a response to compaction and  dewatering of sediment layers, or from strains accrued in the  Earth’s crust near active fault lines.  As global sea levels rise  resulting from climate change, the changes in relative sea  level observed at the coast may be offset in areas where the  land is also moving upward (e.g., parts of Hudson Bay), or  may be exacerbated in areas where the land is sinking (e.g.,  the Atlantic shore of Nova Scotia) (Figure 2-14).   FIGURE 2-14. GPS-derived vertical crustal motion for Canada and surrounding regions (James et al. 2014).     28 | P a g e    Largely because of this experience of vertical land  motion, relative sea levels along Canadian shores  have been changing for a very long time.  In parts of  the Arctic, there is visible evidence of earlier  shorelines in the lines left by older beaches as the  land moved upwards and sea levels dropped (Figure  2-15).   On the East coast, where there are remnants  of earlier settlements, harbour facilities that were  fully operational when constructed nearly 400 years  ago, have now lost some functionality as elements  (e.g., mooring rings) are now below water during high  tide events (Figure 2-16). In areas such as these,  where water levels are rising, historic sites and other  cultural landscapes are increasingly under threat  from inundation, and/or damage from erosion, waves  and changes to nearshore currents.  In  Charlottetown, the capital of Prince Edward Island,  historic records of mean sea level demonstrate a  steady upward climb of approximately 32 cm per  century.  Taken over time, this can amount to a  significant change in local waterfronts (Figure 2-17).                                           FIGURE 2-16:  Field evidence of sea level changes due to land   subsidence at the Fortress of Louisbourg NS.  Note the position of   the historic mooring ring (red circle) as compared to the 1998   high tide level (Image Credit: Taylor et al. 2000).

FIGURE 2-17:  Annual mean water levels (1911-1998)   recorded at Charlottetown, PE in centimetres above chart   datum. The linear regression through the data indicates a   sea-level rise of approximately 32 cm/century.  Similar   rates of sea-level rise have been reported for Halifax, NS,   New Brunswick's southeastern coast, St. John's, NL, and   Channel-Port aux Basques, NL (Accessible from NRCan at   http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/environment/resources/publication  s/impacts-adaptation/reports/assessments/2008/10261 ).   http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/environment/resources/publications/impacts-adaptation/reports/assessments/2008/10261 http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/environment/resources/publications/impacts-adaptation/reports/assessments/2008/10261   29 | P a g e    For coastal areas, sea-level rise is perhaps the most significant anticipated impact of a changing  global climate.  Expectations to date are that throughout the globe sea levels will rise by at least  several centimetres, and in some areas potentially by more than a metre.  Changes to sea level will  have a range of effects on coastal ecosystems and coastal communities.  As nearshore waters  deepen over the next century, coastlines become more vulnerable to damage from heightened  storm surges and more intense wave action.  Deepening waters will inundate salt marshes,  contribute to the loss of seagrass beds, erode beaches and dunes, and alter nearshore marine  ecosystems.   Global sea-level rise has already begun and is projected to continue over the next century and  beyond.  In the most recent models, mean sea levels throughout the globe could increase from  several centimetres to over a metre.  The IPCC and other research agencies are estimating the  scale of sea-level rise based on a number of factors, the chief driver being the concentration of  greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.  Scenarios based on the more recent Representative  Concentration Pathways (RCPs) (See Text Box) provide estimates of global change derived  primarily from land use change and continuing green house gas emissions.  In Canada, because of  the range in contributing factors such as vertical land motion that our coasts face, sea levels will  rise in some areas, and remain stable, or continue to fall in others.  Anticipating the effects on the  Canadian coastline is a complex endeavour derived from the IPCC global scenarios, current data  on changing local parameters, and models that consider local, regional and global factors such as  (Figure 2-18; Table 2-2):   • accurate delineation of mean sea level at local scales;   • the spatial extent and the rate of vertical land motion;    • regional oceanographic effects;   • land water storage;    • thermal expansion of warming sea water; and the   • late/distribution of meltwaters from glaciers, ice caps and ice sheets.    The most current science on anticipated changes in relative sea level at coastal locations across  Canada has been summarized by Natural Resources Canada (Figure 2-19).  The James et al. (2014)  study was based on the recent IPCC RCP scenarios for global warming, and contains detailed  information on the factors appropriate to Canadian coasts   REPRESENTATIVE CONCENTRATION PATHWAYS (RCPs) (IPCC 2014).   RCPs are scenarios adopted by the IPCC in its Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) to model time series   of emissions and concentrations of greenhouse gases, aerosols, and chemically active gases as   well as anticipated changes in land use and land cover.  RCPs are based on a combination of   integrated assessment models, simple climate models, atmospheric chemistry and global carbon   cycle models, and cover a period of time extending up to 2100.  Of the four RCPs developed for   the AR5, the RCP8.5 scenario, used by James et al. 2014 to estimate sea level rise in Canada,   assumes high levels of greenhouse gas emissions, that continue to increase after 2100.

Shaw et al.  (1998) was one the first reviews of Canadian coastal  sensitivity to sea-level rise and contributed to the  development of sensitivity mapping (Figure 2-20).   A  range of relatively recent studies (SEE: ADDITIONAL  READING: Sea-level Rise) have provided more  detailed information on sea-level changes across the  country (Figure 2-21).  Currently, the Geological  Survey of Canada is developing a new sensitivity tool,  that will provide more detailed information at local  scales (Box 2-1).

An initiative of the Geological Survey of   Canada (Natural Resources Canada), CanCoast is an   ArcGIS-based geospatial database that enables   coastal data to be collated, archived, and analysed.    Current estimates of the sensitivity of sea-level rise   on Canadian coasts, while providing indications of   the level of threat, are insufficient for adaptation   efforts at the local level.    CanCoast is developed using a geodatabase   derived from publicly available data.  The platform   consists of a high-resolution marine shoreline   vector developed from CanVec9 that groups   coastal attribute layers of physical features,   materials and processes (e.g., geomorphology,   topography, sea level). CanCoast will facilitate   analysis of coastal sensitivity to climate change   impacts (e.g., sea-level rise, storm surge) at varying   spatial and temporal scales.     To date, a number of datasets (e.g., landforms, tidal   range, wave height) from the Shaw et al. (1998)   study of coastal sensitivity to sea-level change have   been mapped onto the CanCoast shoreline.    Additional layers are now being added.    Topographic relief is based on the Canadian Digital   Elevation Data which is a raster representation of   elevation values over all of Canada at 1 km spatial   resolution.  Sea-level rise is based on projections of   regional sea-level rise for 2050 for representative   concentration pathway RCP8.5 from the Fifth   Assessment Report (AR5) of the Intergovernmental   Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).  Ground ice   conditions for coastal permafrost regions are based   on the Canadian permafrost map (Using the   CanCoast layers, a new index of sensitivity to   climate change, incorporating both inundation and   erosion has been developed (Figure 2-22).         FIGURE 2-22:  Preliminary map of coastal sensitivity to climate change in Canada developed using the CanCoast   database. Sensitivity is based on present-day coastal materials, landforms, relief, ground ice, wave height, and tidal   range, as well as recent trends in total sea-ice concentration and projected changes in sea level to 2050 (Atkinson et   al. 2016). Note that some quite sensitive areas of local or regional importance (e.g. the Fraser Delta) are not clearly   visible at the resolution shown here.   It is planned for CanCOAST to assist in the assessment of heightened erosion and sedimentation, the development   of hazard mapping, and in planning for waterfront development.     34 | P a g e    2.5.2 THE COMBINED EFFECTS OF STORM SURGES AND SEA LEVEL RISE   A storm surge on a marine coastline occurs when water pushed ahead of strong winds piles up  in much the same matter as when blowing on a shallow bowl of soup to cool it can cause the  soup to overflow at the opposite rim of the bowl.  Storm surges of sufficient height can top  existing shoreline features, seawalls and dykes and drive water further inland, flooding  considerably larger areas than would happen during normal sea-level conditions.  Storm surges  that occur during low tide periods can go relatively un-noticed, but when storm surges occur  during higher tide events (storm tide), water levels will exceed expected conditions (e.g., a 5- metre storm surge on top of a high tide that is 1.5 metres above mean sea level will produce a  6.5 metre storm tide).  In addition to damage to marine infrastructure and waterfront property,  storm surges can push water up river channels, flooding into areas normally at distance from  the shore (Figures 2-23, 2-24).  As storm surges reach land, water in the nearshore areas  deepen, allowing more intense waves to reach previously protected coastlines and increasing  the threat of erosion and other damage.     As the climate warms and sea levels in some areas rise, additional stresses are placed on the  nearshore.  Extreme highwater levels are calculated as:   Sea Level +Tide Level + Storm Surge = High Water Levels    Throughout Canada there are considerable assets as well as sensitive ecosystems that exist  within anticipated changes to sea level and are especially vulnerable to storm surges that occur  during highest tide events.                                    FIGURE 2-23:  2010 storm surge flooding in Shediac Bay NB    (Richards and Daigle. 2011, used with permission).   FIGURE 2-24:  Projected 10-year return flooding based on projected sea   level rise to 2100, Indian Island NB (Richards and Daigle 2011, used with   permission).   STORM SURGE is the abnormal rise of water generated by a storm, over and   above the predicted astronomical tide.     STORM TIDE is the water level rise during a storm due to the combination of   storm surge and the astronomical tide    (USA NOAA http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/hurricane/resources/surge_intro.pdf ).   http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/hurricane/resources/surge_intro.pdf   35 | P a g e    2.5.3 SEA LEVEL RISE AND PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE   In the past few years, across North America and Europe there have been events of coastal  and overland flooding that have resulted in significantly higher damage to environments,  settlements, infrastructure and human well-being.  Cities such as Calgary and New York  have found new commonalities as they seek to recover from catastrophic weather events.   Working internally, and through university-community partnerships, the City of  Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island has been considering the effects of sea-level rise on  its downtown areas.  In the past decade Charlottetown has experienced unusually high  storm surges (e.g., 4.23 m above Chart Datum- 21 January 2000).  When projected sea- level rise is considered together with storm surges arising from events already  experienced, flooding in the downtown area and along some of the rivers will reach new  heights.  Relative sea-level change and storm surges based on current storm intensities  were used to calculate anticipated flood levels, now set at 4.93m above mean tide (Chart  Datum) (McCulloch et al 2002; Forbes et al. 2012).  When storm surges are combined with  high precipitation events (situations that are not uncommon in this part of Canada), the  potential for overland flooding from the combination of higher sea levels and increased  stormwater runoff increases (Figure 2-25).   As a consequence of these changing conditions, the City has included new guidelines for  anticipated highwater levels along its waterfront and adapted its Town Plan.  Continuing  planning efforts work to inform local landowners of increasing risk, and to adapt to the  changing future.                                  FIGURE 2-25:  Charlottetown downtown area before and after anticipated high water   event at 4.93m above chart datum (current mean sea level) (Hope Parnham, former City   of Charlottetown) (Image Credit: Hope Parnham, used with permission).   “When the climate changes,   almost everything else   about the environment   changes with it.”   John Holdren, Assistant to the President (USA) for Science   and Technology         36 | P a g e    2.6 THE SPECIAL CASE FOR CANADA’S NORTH   The Canadian North is unique in so many ways that  discussion of the effects of climate change takes on whole  new dimensions.  It is likely that north of 60 in Canada is  where the impacts of the changing environment will be first  felt, hardest felt, and will pose the most difficult challenges  to an adapting society (AMAP 2017; Arctic Council 2016);  Streiker 2016).   The truth of the matter is we can only speculate on the scope  and range of direct and indirect impacts of warming  temperatures and melting ice in the Arctic.  Ford et al. (2015)  have attempted to summarize the biophysical aspects of  change in the Arctic (Table 2-3).  The authors, in their review  of the literature on adaptation to the changing environment  conclude that:    “The challenge of adaptation in the Arctic is formidable, but  the reviewed studies indicate that many of these challenges  can be overcome, avoided or reduced by individual or  collective effort, creative management, changed ways of  thinking, political will, institutional change and financial  support. Indeed, northerners are already active agents in  responding to climate change at multiple levels, and  adaptations are already taking place at household and  community scales. Although these local responses represent  important developments, adapting to future change will  require broader-level action to address both generic and  specific capacities to adapt in the context of ongoing social,  economic, political, demographic and environmental  change. There is evidence of this happening in some  locations, although a coherent vision and framework for  approaching adaptation is largely absent (Ford et al. 2015,  p1051).   This Primer does not presume to discuss Arctic climate  change in any degree of depth or sensitivity.  Readers are  advised to find more expert sources for information from the  material provided and their own research.

While Canadian polar bears, which are top predators in Northern ecosystems, will  be affected by a warming climate, they are not the only species or ecosystem that will be changed.  Climate change  will influence all the landscapes of Canada, with the impacts more severely felt in some areas than in others.     Terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems are physically, chemically and biologically linked in complex,  supportive relationships.  What happens on the hilltop can and does change what happens in the bay.  As the  climate changes, and weather and seasons are affected, short- and long-term shifts in environmental parameters  (e.g., air and water temperature, precipitation, wind speed, snow and ice cover, erosion and sedimentation) will  directly and indirectly affect other factors such as river water levels, ground water stability, soil chemistry and  structure, and ocean acidification.                                         Image Credit: C. Mercer Clarke   “While 'global warming' is a general description of the potential effects,   scientists believe that the biggest effects from climate change will be   changes in rainfall patterns, ocean currents, growing seasons and everything   else that depends on climate.    The impacts of climate change differ between one   region and the next, with some regions likely to experience more  frequent droughts, whilst others experience an increase in rainfall and   potentially flooding.  This could affect the availability and affordability of   food and water, significantly impact poverty levels, health, mortality rates,   and ultimately drive sizeable population displacement with all its associated   implications.”   CitiGroup GPS 2015     47 | P a g e    3.2 EFFECTS ON ECOSYSTEMS AND ECOSYSTEM SERVICES   Changes to ecosystem structure and function may arise as a result of local, seasonal, or migrational  sensitivities to changes in physiological functions, to disturbances in the structure and functioning  of habitat, and to interference with existing interspecies relationships whether they be predator- prey, shelter, or competition.       Much of the recent focus on climate change has been on extreme weather events and the flooding  resulting from cloudbursts and storm surge.  However, changes in the climate and impacts from  storms will have much broader effects on the structure and functioning of ecosystems and on the  ecosystem services upon which human society depends.     SOILS   Rising temperatures, heat and cold extremes and changes in precipitation will affect soil chemistry  and structure, degrading soil conditions, and increasing the potential for landslides and erosion.   Changes in precipitation patterns and rising seas may challenge the availability of potable water  and water for irrigation.  Severe weather events that erode shorelines, alter stream channels and  contribute high volumes of water to nearshore areas will destroy shallow water habitat, change  shoreline configurations, and damage or destroy nearshore human settlement.     HABITATS AND SPECIES   As conditions change, growing seasons will be affected, and habitats may become less hospitable  for native species and more welcoming to invasive species.  Plants and animals will either adapt to  these changes in climate, or they may migrate over time to areas that better meet their  requirements (e.g., higher altitudes, deeper water, more northern areas).  In British Columbia, it  has been estimated that even a shift of 1 C° may result in shifting the range of existing forest  ecosystems by as much as 150 km northward or 300 metres higher in elevation (GOV/CAN/BC  2010).  In some situations, plant and animal species may not be able to accomplish needed  migrations quickly enough to outpace changing conditions, resulting in deterioration in local  populations and the potential for loss of species in affected area ecosystems.   In addition to changes to growing seasons, extreme periods of heat or cold will alter the viability  of some species while increasing the potential for invasion by new organisms.  Drought and high  temperatures may have other affects as well.  In some regions in Canada, changing conditions have  already contributed to increases in the frequency, intensity and coverage of forest fires, destroying  valuable habitat and resources, and wreaking havoc on human communities.         LANDSCAPE:  a cluster of interacting and nested ecosystems that is   characterized by the structures, functions and developmental trends   of the natural and social environment that make it distinctly different   from adjacent landscapes.  Landscapes are an integral part of   ecological organization, falling below biomes and regions, and   above ecosystems.   ECOSYSTEM:  a community of living organisms that function in   conjunction with the nonliving components of their environment   (e.g., air, water and soil), interacting through nutrient cycles and   energy flows. Ecosystems can be any size but usually encompass   specific, limited spaces.   HABITAT: the natural home of a plant or animal species, which may   include feeding, breeding, and/or migrating habitats.  Habitats are   characterized by physical, chemical and biological factors.   FIGURE 3-1: Ashcroft Reserve wildfire burning at Loon Lake British Columbia.   (Image Credit: Shawn Cahill Wikipedia CC By-SA 4.0).     48 | P a g e    FRESHWATER AND MARINE SYSTEMS   In the ocean, rising temperatures will affect water chemistry,  altering parameters such as oxygen concentration and  acidity.  Chemistry changes such as these, especially when  coupled with the impacts from human activities at or near  the shore, or on the water, will have knock-on effects on the  range and abundance of some species, on the viability of  shelled species (e.g. clams, mussels) and on the productivity  of important habitats such as salt marshes.    RESOURCES    As environments, ecosystems and species are changed,  human access to potable water, food, and shelter may be  affected.  In resource-based economies, some industries  dependent on forest or fish resources may suffer badly.   Recreation based tourism may be either negatively or  positively affected, depending on local conditions, and  opportunities may open in other sectors such as agriculture.     In the ocean, rising temperatures will affect water chemistry,  altering parameters such as oxygen concentration and  acidity.  Chemistry changes such as these, especially when  coupled with the impacts from human activities at or near  the shore, or on the water, will have knock-on effects on the  range and abundance of some species, on the viability of  shelled species (e.g. clams, mussels) and on the productivity  of important habitats such as salt marshes.       GLACIERS AND FRESHWATER AND MARINE ECOSYSTEMS   Along the western coasts of Canada, late summer glacial meltwater has important implications to   aquatic ecosystems, agriculture, forestry, tourism, water quality and resources development (Clarke et   al. 2015).  As glaciers diminish or are eliminated, reduced meltwater in British Columbian rivers may   have deleterious effects on the viability of cold water fish species such as salmon and trout.  Nearshore   commercial fish stocks may migrate to more northern waters, displacing local fisheries.  The changing   climate may reduce resilience in species already pressured by other stressors such as the effect of pine   beetles on forests.     IMPACTS ON ECOSYSTEMS IN CANADA    • Climate shifts will affect the productivity and range of species and alter the functioning of ecosystems    • Higher water temperatures will affect fecundity, productivity and food chain relationships in aquatic   and marine species.  Cold water species such as trout and salmon will be challenged to survive in   warmer waters.    • Acidification of seawater will threaten the growth and survival of shellfish species and may interfere   with the performance of species such as the pink salmon.     • Rising levels of nutrients in water systems will stimulate phytoplankton blooms leading to depleted   oxygen in some areas and creating dead zones.    • Rising sea levels, floods and droughts and loss of ice cover will result in changes in erosion and   sedimentation patterns, and alter lake shores, river channels and shoreline topography.  Historic   dykes may be overwhelmed and features such as eel grass beds and wetlands lost to coastal squeeze.   • In the North, terrestrial ecosystems will be affected by changes in seasonality, loss of snow and ice   and thawing permafrost, all of which will impact traditional hunter-gathering services to aboriginal   populations (Mercer Clarke et al. 2016):   Image Credit: C. Mercer Clarke     49 | P a g e    3.2.1 THE CARBON CYCLE   Throughout Canada, shifts in climatic normals will  affect the growth and productivity of plant species, a  situation important to the provision of food services,  but also critical to the sustainability of air quality, the  reduction of urban heat islands, and the capture of  carbon from the atmosphere.  The forests of Canada  play a critical role in the earth’s carbon cycle    The “carbon cycle” refers to the constant movement  of carbon from the land and water through the  atmosphere and living organisms (Figure 3-2).  While  the oceans contain 85% of the active carbon on earth,  Canada’s forests also play an important role as both  carbon sinks and carbon sources.  Carbon sinks  absorb more carbon from the atmosphere than they  release.  Carbon sources release more carbon than  they absorb.  Historically, forests in Canada have been  carbon sinks, but in the past 100 years the situation  has reversed, probably as the result of deforestation  practices, wildfires, and insect damage.  Improving  forests, even urban forest canopies, will improve our  capacity to reduce greenhouse gas contributions, and  contribute overall to better air quality.     Trees and forests are susceptible to damage from  wind, extremes of temperature, drought and  excessive precipitation or flooding, and from shifts in  growing season conditions.  As temperatures warm,  while the ranges of some forest tree species will  expand in altitude and in latitude, there are increasing  concerns for the sustainability of forest biomes  throughout the country.  Within urban centres,  maintenance of the tree canopy that provides a range  of physical and aesthetic services, faces additional  challenges as some species become less viable.              The CARBON CYCLE is the constant circulation of carbon atoms throughout the biosphere.  Plants on the land,   and in freshwater and marine ecosystems absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, processing it during   photosynthesis to create complex organic compounds which can be consumer by other organisms.  Carbon   returns to the atmosphere through respiration by plants and animals, through decay and through the burning of   fossil fuels.      FIGURE 3-2:  Graphic representation of the carbon cycle (Image Credit: USA Department of Energy, Oak Ridge National   Laboratory, Wikipedia Public Domain.

Increasing amounts  of carbon dioxide in the ocean leads to higher carbonic acid concentration in surface waters,  increasing acidity, decreasing concentrations of available carbonate ions, and reducing the levels of  other biologically important calcium carbonate minerals.  Calcium is an important building block for  the skeletons and shells of many marine organisms.  As carbon dioxide levels rise in surface waters,  the ability of some organisms (e.g., mussels, lobster, corals) to produce and to maintain their shells  is impeded.   Ocean acidification will have an array of impacts on marine and coastal species.  Some species of  phytoplankton and seagrasses may benefit from more substantial concentrations of carbon dioxide.   Other organisms, such as shellfish, corals and calcareous plankton, will face challenges in an  acidifying environment.  In some areas of the United States and Canada, lower pH in nearshore  waters may be one of the causative factors for current failures in shellfish aquaculture and fisheries.   As concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide increases, and the climate warms, surface water  concentrations will also increase, resulting in pH levels that the oceans have not experienced in  more than 20 million years.                                          OCEAN ACIDIFICATION is the ongoing decrease in the pH of the   world’s oceans, caused by the uptake of carbon dioxide (CO2) from   the atmosphere.  An estimated 30-40% of the carbon dioxide   derived from human activities and released into the atmosphere   finds its way into oceans, rivers and lakes.  When carbon dioxide is   absorbed by seawater, chemical reactions occur that reduce the pH   of the seawater (increasing acidity).    A pH UNIT is a measure of acidity that ranges from 0-14.  The   lower the value, the more acidic the water.  Since the beginning of   the industrial revolution, acidity in the world’s surface oceans has   increased by 0.01 pH units.  Since pH is a logarithmic scale, this   decrease in pH represents a 30 per cent increase in acidity.

As the climate changes, and water  levels rise, shifts in physical, chemical and biological conditions may no longer  support these habitats.  While these shifts are common throughout coastal  ecosystems, the timing of change may be accelerated beyond that needed for natural  migration of habitats and species.     Marsh plants have a quite narrow range of tolerance for water depths.  In some cases,  variations in water depths of only a few centimetres will determine which species of  plant lives where in a marsh.  Changes in water depths can cause major changes in  marsh composition and may even impact the capacity of a marsh to survive in that  location.  When marshes and dunes are pinched between rising water levels (e.g.,  changes in precipitation patterns, sea level rise, storm surge) and unfriendly  nearshore topography (e.g., cliffs, rocky shores), and/or built environments (e.g., sea   walls, roadways, land development), they may be unable to migrate to more  optimum conditions.  When marshes and dunes are unable to move inland, they can  be caught in a coastal squeeze that can result in reductions in area, loss of  productivity or even permanent loss of these unique ecosystems.    Species that rely on marsh and dune ecosystems, for even a portion of their life-cycle,  will also be affected when habitats are lost due to coastal squeeze.  Even when un- impacted in other areas of their range, coastal squeeze can also affect the feeding,  breeding and/or rearing patterns of migratory species.  When native species are  adversely impacted, new species that can better adapt to changing conditions may  move into new areas, affecting biodiversity, altering predator-prey relationships, and  in some cases detrimentally affecting ecosystem structure and function.  Ecosystems,  habitats and species already impacted by human activities (e.g., nitrification,  contamination, siltation, urbanization) may be unable to cope with the additional  stresses associated with changing conditions.                                           FIGURE 3-4:  Graphic illustration of the natural and man-made barriers   that prevent marsh migration and create coastal squeeze.   Current sea level     52 | P a g e    3.2.4 ECOSYSTEM SERVICES   When environmental change occurs in conjunction with human-induced stresses,  the resilience of natural environments may be further compromised, further  reducing the capacity to absorb the effects of significant climate shifts (e.g., long- term droughts) and/or extreme events (e.g., storms, wildfires, and floods.  Direct  and indirect, or trickle down, effects will result in increasingly widespread  ramifications on human society.   Canada is home to over 70,000 species of animals, plants and fungi, many of  which feed us, clothe us, provide resources for our shelter, filter our water,  pollinate our crops and ensure we have air to breathe.  Harvesting and  processing of biological resources employ millions of Canadians, and in 2012  contributed over $24.8 Billion to the GDP (Sustainable Canada Dialogues 2015).   The services provided by the marine, aquatic, and terrestrial ecosystems of the  country have to date been too often taken for granted, resulting in a general  decline in biodiversity, that has placed more than 700 species at risk of  extinction.     Throughout the diverse landscapes of Canada, many communities directly rely  on local environmental resources for services that support their economic and  cultural well-being.  Ecosystem services can include provisioning services (e.g.,  food and drinking water supplies, energy, wood products); supporting services  (e.g., land for settlement, transportation, water for energy generation and  irrigation); regulating services (e.g., purifying water, waste reception and  treatment, tempering weather) and cultural services (e.g., aesthetics,  recreation, education) (Figure 3-5).  Nearshore habitats (e.g., wetlands, coastal  forests, dunes) can also provide valuable support that shelters vulnerable  shorelines and assets from extreme weather.  As human populations in Canada  have shifted from being primarily rural to being primarily urban, society has  developed often complex infrastructure and systems to deliver food, clean  drinking water and dependable energy to consumers.  While efficient in their use  of resources, these systems have created environments where the consumer is  increasingly disconnected from the natural environment that services their  community, at a time when a shifting climate and severe weather events may  alter or eliminate the provision of those services.         FIGURE 3-5:  Ecosystem services as categorized in the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment    (Image Credit:  MetroVancouver.org, used with permission).     53 | P a g e    The effects of a changing climate on ecosystems and ecosystem services are wide-ranging, with some  changes anticipated for the entire country, and others being locally significant only (Table 3-1).  Extreme  weather may disrupt or destroy ecosystem structure and function.  Food supply can be affected through  the diminished fish stocks, destruction of farms and crops, and impacts to food distribution networks.     Impacts to water resources can include contamination of surface water drinking supplies, and disruption  of wastewater treatment systems (which in turn can contribute to contamination of other water  resources).  Flood waters may become contaminated with chemicals and nutrients (St.-Hilaire et al.  2016).  Reductions in freshwater discharges to coastal waters may affect local and migratory fish species,  more so where flows have already been reduced by human use of water (e.g., potable water supply,  irrigation, dams and diversions, energy generation).  Further reductions as a result of diminished  precipitation (i.e., rain and snow), reduced glacial melt water, and higher temperatures increase  seasonal stresses on some nearshore marine waters, increasing salinity and nutrient and contaminant  loading and reducing oxygen levels.  Nutrification of nearshore waters increases the potential for  harmful algal blooms, and can impact coastal tourism, aquaculture and the quality of life for nearshore  residents.  There are increasing concerns that changes in freshwater discharge regimes will affect  recruitment, predator prey relationships and ecosystem functions of important habitats such as  wetlands and seagrass beds.     As the climate changes, some of the associated alterations to ecosystem services may be less dramatic  and more insidious.  Higher air and water temperatures will alter the range of some agricultural and  forestry crops, and interfere with the productivity of local area fisheries.  As ecosystem services to  communities deteriorate, society may become more vulnerable to stress and to disease.     In some areas of the country, changes to ecosystems could open new opportunities for humans.   However, it will take time and resources for most societies to make the transition from established  practices to the kind of evolving and strategic planning needed to capitalize on new species, increased  production, or shifting opportunities in agriculture, forestry or tourism.

Traditional expectations have  been that communities and individuals will be resilient to normal changes and variations in weather patterns, but this is being challenged by emerging understandings of the  complex relationships between society and its connection with the natural environment, and an acknowledgement of the failings of current building practice and management.     As the climate changes, human health and well-being will be impacted both directly and indirectly, through increased stress on individual well-being, on local economics and  population dynamics, and on cultures (Figure 3-6) (Table 3-2).     Increasing temperatures in these and other areas can also foster increased transmission of waterborne and insect-borne diseases and may foster the entrance or expansion of  invasive species, some of which may pose threats to human populations or activity.  Changes in agricultural growing cycles, resulting from changes in mean and extreme  temperature profiles and changes in precipitation, will challenge food security and food costs in some areas.  Traditional crops may also become more difficult to grow as  conditions in these regions move beyond that crop’s capacity to adapt.  In some areas of the country, especially in the North , remote communities will require additional  resources to move goods and services over long distances, as existing transportation routes and methods are increasingly challenged by changing conditions       “WELL-BEING is about promoting a better way of life and equality for   citizens.  Well being in its simplest definition is: Being Well.  It is where the   basic human requirements are met, whilst being afforded the opportunity to   have optimistic aspirations enveloped in an environment where the   endeavour of ‘Being Well’ can be achieved, therefore, attaining a satisfactory   quality and standard of life and happiness.” (Institute of Wellbeing 2015)      VULNERABILITY: The propensity or predisposition to be adversely affected.    Vulnerability encompasses a variety of concepts and elements including   sensitivity or susceptibility to harm and lack of capacity to cope and adapt.   (IPCC 2014, p5).    Vulnerability is a function of the character, magnitude, and rate of climate   variation to which a system is exposed, its sensitivity and its adaptive   capacity (Parry et al. 2007, p883).    Vulnerable segments of society can include identifiable populations such as   the aged or young, the disabled, or the economically or politically   disadvantaged.     FIGURE 3-6:  Factors that affect a person’s vulnerability to extreme heat at an Individual   and community scale (GOV/CAN/Health 2011).     57 | P a g e    Many elements of society in Canada rely on linkages that bridge between marine, aquatic and terrestrial systems.   Transportation networks in most communities rely on some combination of airline, road, rail, and subway systems,  and coastal communities additionally link to local, national and international waterborne traffic.  Changes in the  environment will result in damage to and delays in most of these systems.  Without proactive measures to protect  against these impacts, communities will suffer as these needed connections are severed, even if only for a matter  of days.  Urban infrastructure such as stormwater management and distribution and treatment systems for water  and wastewater also traverse multiple environments, and in many cases, are structured so that disposal outfalls  are in close proximity to marine and freshwater environments.  These systems are vulnerable to increased  precipitation events, and flooding created by rising waters (including sea levels) and intensified storm surges.   Stormwater systems and wastewater disposal systems can be doubly challenged as heightened flood levels meet  rising seas, increasing the potential for back flooding in the community and compounding the impacts accordingly.   These rising costs and risks, whether for repairing damage, increased insurance burdens, or relocation efforts, all  act to elevate stress overall throughout the community in general, both to individuals and with organizations that  must cope with these issues.  This is further exacerbated because often, those most at risk in these instances are  also those with the least capacity to adapt to these changes.   Adaptation planning must proactively address issues of social justice to ensure that significant harm does not befall  vulnerable populations.  It will also be important to ensure adaptation efforts are fully integrated into local,  regional and national cultures.  As a driver of human behaviour, cultural perspectives and cultural responses can  be resistant to change but can alter when faced with pressing needs.  In adapting to the challenges presented by  climate change, a cultural shift in the protection and management of existing assets and in the development of  new regions may be required, and in some communities, is arguably already under way.  In some communities in  Canada, broad changes are already taking place, fueled by the conviction that a prosperous and sustainable future,  one that addresses immediate and long-term effects from a changing environment, must entail consideration of  all needs and aspects of society from individual actions to the greater public good.  To be completely successful,  integration of sustainability must go further than town policies and urban planning and must support incorporating  these needed changes into local culture.  It must delve into specific local threats, propose changes relevant and  attractive to local populations, and ensure that there is sufficient local capacity to effect such changes.

Table 3-3 outlines how changes in climate and weather  patterns can have effects on human health and well-being,  now and in the future.  These impacts can be felt at the  national, regional or local scale, and will change in  geographic distribution and in timing as climate change  advances.    In Canada, where wastewater treatment facilities are often  located in areas that could be vulnerable to both overland  flooding and sea-level rise, the potential exists for these  systems to fail during extreme weather events, especially  where this infrastructure is already aging.  Additionally,  measures currently in place to determine safe levels of  contaminants in discharged water (including industrial  effluents) may require adjustment, as water levels change,  temperatures increase, and circulation patterns are altered,  all of which change the baseline those discharge standards  are set to work with.

The most immediate threats will be  to those nations which are already challenged by  increases in flooding events, whether through sea  level rise, or as the result of some combination of low- elevation development patterns, subsiding  landscapes, increased precipitation, snow melt,  erosion of shorelines (Figures 3-7, 3-8).     While the risks of flooding can be obvious, issues such  as desertification and inland flooding can pose both  encroaching or sudden impacts to landlocked  communities as well.  Canadians will also need to  consider how climate change can be a trigger for  conflict in areas in which resources are under stress.   Even before the Middle East refugee crisis of 2015,  the International Monetary Fund had accepted that  massive migrations would ‘warrant serious and  current attention’ (IMF 2008, p. 4).     Situations being experienced in the Middle East, and  in other conflict areas of the world, could be the  harbinger of future challenges as changing sea levels  render regions of the world inhospitable or unsafe for  human populations.  Drought and flood exacerbate  civil instability and enhance conditions for strife and  war.  This is particularly evident in poorer nations,  which can lack the resources to relocate displaced  citizens, driving them to seek refugee status in  neighbouring nations or elsewhere in the global  community.  The needed resettlement of substantial  numbers of climate refugees will place stresses upon  communities and individuals in Canada as well as  other nations, as the world struggles to ensure that  everyone has a safe home and access to basic needs  and comforts.      FIGURE 3-7:  Floods along the Ottawa River 2017. (Image Credit: C. Mercer Clarke).   “The speed, severity, and complexity of  known and unknown changes in climate and   ecosystems will challenge the ability of society to   generate fitting responses.“ (Adger et al. 2011, p758)   FIGURE 3-8:  Male, the capital city of the Maldives, an island nation threatened by sea level rise (Image Credit: Shahee Ilyas,   Wikipedia, CC BY SA 3.0).     61 | P a g e    3.4 EFFECTS ON THE ECONOMY   The financial sector has recently awakened to the risks imposed by a changing climate on  assets and on investment.  Estimated losses worldwide leading up to 2100 have been  valued at US$ 4.3 trillion, a figure equivalent to the total worth of all the world’s oil and  gas companies, or to the GDP of Japan (The Economist 2015).  Climate change is now  understood to be inevitable and permanent, but the magnitude of the change is not yet  set in stone.  Should the globe warm by at least 5 C°, economic losses could climb to US$7  trillion, or to US$13.8 trillion if temperatures increases soar to 6 C° (The Economist 2015).   The costs of adaptation and mitigation need to be measured against these risked losses,  even if focusing exclusively on the fiscally responsible choice to make for investors over  the next several decades.   The World Economic Forum (2016) has identified the failure of climate change mitigation  and adaptation measures as the top most impactful global risk, ranking above the risks  associated with weapons of mass destruction or crises in water supply.  Failures to address  climate change, the potential for extreme weather events, and large-scale involuntary  migration were the top three risks in terms of likelihood to occur.  As nations struggle with  water availability and food security, failures to address the changing climate will only  exacerbate these circumstances, leading to forced displacement, civil strife and to both  voluntary and involuntary migration.  The economic costs will be daunting both to the  nations affected by these impacts directly, and to those nations receiving these refugees.   The changing environment will have both positive and negative effects on national and  regional economies, but to capitalize on the former and minimize the latter, proactive  decision-making is required (Figure 3-9).  The degree of financial impact on institutions and  individuals will largely relate to how resilient they are, to their capacity and willingness to  change where needed, and most especially, to the early onset of planning and action to  reduce greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere and to prepare society for the coming  changes in environmental conditions.  As documentation on climate changes accrues,  scientists are increasingly concerned over projections of future weather and climate over  the next 80 years, which show a clear escalation in trends over that time frame, if  emissions of greenhouse gases are not significantly curbed and reduced from 2005 levels.   The highest estimates for future damages, and indeed for failures to capture potential  opportunities, will result from a refusal to acknowledge and to adjust to these projected  outcomes proactively, with one eye always towards the future (GOV/CAN/NRTEE 2010).       A GLOBAL RISK is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, can cause   significant negative impact for several countries or industries within the next   10 years. (WEF 2016)   DIRECT IMPACTS are economic impacts that occur at the source of where   climate-related extreme event influences the economy.  The source may be   an economic sector, or an asset class (e.g., buildings).  The economic impact   can result from damages to fixed assets, and losses due to business   interruptions.  (IBC 2015)   SECONDARY IMPACTS result from the ripple effect of direct impacts on the   broader economy, as subsequent spending takes place.  Spending from a   direct impact does not result in a net gain for society.  Spending related to   construction and remediation might benefit the construction sector, but there   will be a transfer of resources and activity to industries responding to an   event and away from those that suffered damage because of the event.  (IBC   2015)     62 | P a g e          FIGURE 3-9:  Economic and social impacts associated with climate change (Adapted from GOV/CAN/NRTEE 2010).     63 | P a g e    In North America and in Europe, it has been determined that considerable costs could  be avoided, and significant gains could be achieved through early reductions in  greenhouse gas emissions (GOV/USA/EPA 2015).  In Canada, the effects of extreme  weather are already setting new records, whether it is in merchantable timber lost to  wildfires, crops damaged by drought and/or flooding, migrating fish stocks, losses  related to transportation delays, or in direct damage to buildings, roads and services.   Sales derived from ecosystem services in Canada totalled US$3.9 billion in 2010, in  which sales of goods contributed US$ 2.2 billion (UNEP 2014).  The economic value of  the other contributions made by Canada’s natural environments has not been  calculated but the list includes services such as provisions of safe drinking water,  removal of contaminants, acceptance and purification of wastes, and, of course, clean  air and a protective atmosphere   Throughout Canada, public infrastructure is aging, and in its weakened state may be  more vulnerable to damage (Table 3-5).  Early attention paid to needed upgrades, to  address projected future conditions, could require additional funds to be expended in  the coming years. However, this short-term expenditure will lead to significant savings  in the long run, as proactive upgrades are typically less costly than repairing and  rebuilding after structural damage has occurred.  This early attention to wise  economic planning could save billions in damages and retrofit costs.  Current  estimates anticipate that the long term financial impacts of natural catastrophes  (Table 3-4) in Canada could reach $5 Billion per year by 2020 and $21-43 billion per  year by 2050 (Alexander and McDonald 2014).  Stanton et al. (2010) estimated that  the damages to Canada’s economy could reach as high as $1.1 trillion by 2100.  In  recent work on case studies conducted in Halifax (NS) and Mississauga (ON), the IBC  (2015) projected that direct damages from anticipated storm surges alone in the  Halifax Regional Municipality could cost as much as $9 million annually by 2040.     The Insurance Bureau of Canada (IBC) has reported that prior to 2011, insurance  claims for damages due to severe weather were not notable.  Since that time, damage  claims resulting from weather events are on average $1 billion annually, and in 2013  reached a high of $3.6 billion (Table 3-4).  Private insurance in Canada has generally  not covered damage from overland flooding (although some insurers are changing this  policy), and there is as yet no federally supported relief program such as the National  Flood Insurance Program in the United States.  As forest fires rage across large areas  and water levels rise, whether from inland flooding or from sea-level rise and storm  surges, the liabilities will continue to increase for insurance companies, and the  expectation is that the cost for home and property insurance will increase as a result.
