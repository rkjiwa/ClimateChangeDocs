Across provincial infrastructure  and on farms, the food system  is vulnerable to rapid as well as  long-term changes in climate  and economic forces. These  vulnerabilities can impact food  production, transport, storage, and  consumption.    • Farmers’ observations match  climate change projections for  the region. The literature on  climate change in the region was  corroborated by the farmers we  interviewed. Farmers noted that, in  the past years, precipitation events  have become increasingly erratic;  windiness has increased; and the  growing season has slowly shifted  later into the autumn.   • Climate resilience is financial  resilience. Farmers are able to adapt  their practices when they have the  financial capacity to do so. This  means supporting markets, business  training, and practices that minimize  risk and help build financial resilience.  • Building adaptive capacity for the  food system means recognizing  small-scale farmers as actors in  their own right.  Possible avenues  for policymakers include creating  spaces where food system actors  can dialogue and exchange  knowledge; making sure that  legislation differentiates between  the needs of small-scale farms and  large-scale farms; and promoting  marketing avenues which distribute  risk and open new markets, through  institutions like co-operatives.   Food Systems and  Climate Change in  the Canadian Maritimes  Policy Brief | Environmental Change Institute, University of Oxford |  July 2017  Bernard Soubry, M.Phil Candidate in Environmental Change and Management, Environmental Change Institute  Climate change is a concern for the food system in the Canadian  Maritimes. Coastal sea level rise, changing temperatures, and  increasingly erratic weather impact the way food is produced, stored,  distributed, and consumed. Current production techniques are  responsible for a significant part of greenhouse gas emissionsi. In this  way, agriculture is both a cause of and at risk from climate change.   We asked 40 farmers, retailers, and other food system actors about  the vulnerability of the food system in the Maritimes. Our research  identifies key areas of intervention for governments and other  institutions on the federal and provincial levels. Integrating local  knowledge about small-scale producers’ experiences will help inform  meaningful action on climate change adaptation. Current practices  must change towards more sustainable and resilient production in  order to safeguard the Maritime food system.

Climate Resilience on Maritime Farms Project    2  Climate change and food in the maritimes:  projections and observations Local knowledge and observation corroborates with international and national projections.    IPCC SAYS FARMERS SAY Seasonal shifts towards longer autumns: models for the  region forecast a shift in temperatures over the coming  years which would potentially increase the growing  seasonii.   Farmers observed that late frosts are getting later,  shifting the growing season towards the fall. Cold and  precipitation are causing issues with accessing land  early in the season; maintaining farm infrastructure; and  planning for market.  More erratic weather and precipitation: Climate  modelling for the region suggests increased variability  in precipitation over time. More erratic precipitation can  lead to drought, waterlogging, and erosion, all of which  may have negative consequences for cropsiii.   Farmers have observed significant changes in weather  patterns in past years, including • more wind events, potentially causing damage to   crops and to farm infrastructure. • intense and erratic precipitation.   Impacts on distribution channels and infrastructure  may become common in the future, according to  climate adaptation focused on the Maritimesiv.  Significant pockets of the Maritime region run the risk  of being cut off, or otherwise significantly impacted, by  the effects of sea level rise and coastal erosion on roads  and other protective infrastructureiv.  Small-scale producers and larger distributors rely on a  small number of main highways to distribute and sell  their produce. Participants interviewed worried that if  roads became inaccessible, food distribution would be  severely impeded.

The  use of greenhouses and   hoophouses to extend the  growing season allows  farmers to start crops  much earlier than they   would in outdoor growing  conditions.

Resilience refers to “the  capacity of a system  to tolerate disturbance  without collapsingv”, while  still maintaining options to  develop. Resilience theory  understands that social and  ecological systems cannot be  understood in absence of each  othervi”.   Resilient On the farm, climate resilience  techniques include an increased  diversification of crops to  distribute the risk of a crop failure.  In interviews, farmers discussed  the advantages of growing multiple  varieties of one crop and selecting  carefully for those varieties which  produced best in their microclimate.    Farmers also spoke of soil  management as one of the  strongest ways of building on- farm resilience. By managing soil to  promote water retention or drainage  based on the needs of the farm,  farmers lessen their dependence on  organic or conventional fertilizers,  mitigate the effects of heavy  precipitation, and retain moisture  during periods of drought.    How are farmers reacting to and planning for  climate change in the maritimes? Small-scale farmers in the Maritimes are…  What do we mean by  adaptive capacity?  Adaptive capacity is the  capacity to make changes  in behaviour which support  adaptation objectives (like a  healthy food system). This  capacity is driven in part  by socioeconomic status;  effectiveness of governance  institutions; and capacity  to self-organize within the   systemvii.    Adaptive Interviews revealed that small- scale farms fulfil several indicators  of high adaptive capacity. Some  examples include:  Production methods that are  varied and experimental: Small- scale agriculture is adaptive and  flexible by nature. Farmers in  the Canadian Maritimes have  been experimenting with season  extension infrastructure, crop  varieties, and market gardening  techniques. They can exchange  information and experiment results  at gatherings.    Farmers discussed the idea of  financial resilience in the face  of climate change, by making  their businesses less susceptible  to changes in the market or in  consumer preferences. Examples of  financial resilience include marketing  co-operatives, which are prominent  in New Brunswick, and community  supported agriculture (CSA)  schemes. Marketing co-operatives  are key to maintaining a share of  the market for small farmers, as  well as distributing financial risk  between farms. CSAs stabilize cash  flow by asking customers to pay  for a season’s worth of produce in  advance and give farmers a better  idea of demand, thereby lowering  the risk of overproduction, and form  strong social bonds with customers.    A strong social network of formal  and informal adaptive institutions:  Farmers spoke to the closeness  of the farming community in the  Maritimes. Given that there are  relatively few small farms in each  region, it is possible for information  to move very quickly between  farms, and for advice and help to  come quickly when it is needed.  Acceptance that the future will be  volatile: Dealing with uncertainty  is a basic reality of farming in the  Maritimes. Maritime farmers spoke  about ensuring that any investment  they make will be able to adapt  to changes, and to be resilient to  shocks and surprises.        4  Vulnerable In interviews, farmers identified several vulnerabilities to their businesses  as food producers, as well as to the food system in general.    Farmers were concerned with lack of adequate infrastructure for  transportation, storage, and distribution of food across the Maritimes.  Key transportation routes are at risk of being affected by sea level rise  and storms, which would in turn affect farmers’ ability to go to market, or  for distributors to bring produce to stores. They also mentioned a lack of  distribution, processing, and storage infrastructure across regions, which  leaves individual farms vulnerable to storms and makes processing meat a  difficult and costly process.    Many small farmers lack trust in governance institutions. This lack of  trust was traced back to a feeling that such institutions primarily existed  to represent the interests of large-scale agriculture. Support which would  otherwise be available to small farms is often rejected due to a dislike of  bureaucracy or a lack of understanding with regards to opportunities.    What do we mean by  vulnerability?  The Intergovernmental Panel  on Climate Change defines  vulnerability as “the degree to  which geophysical, biological  and socio-economic systems  are susceptible to, and  unable to cope with, adverse  impacts of climate change”viii.  It includes factors which may  enhance or deter adaptive  capacity.    Barriers to adaptation Lack of provincial adaptation planning for the food system. There is  currently no explicit, public provincial strategy for food systems adaptation  to climate change in New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, or Prince Edward Island.  Without proper consideration from government, food systems adaptation  will be difficult to develop quickly and effectively. Lack of unified planning  on the federal and provincial levels negatively impacts the adaptive  capacity of actors across the food system by impeding financial support  and knowledge exchange.   Weak support networks between farmers and governance institutions.  Many small farmers across the Maritimes suggested that they had a  difficult with funding and support organizations, especially provincial and  federal departments.  Farmers pointed out that they found it difficult to  trust government officials due to a perceived skew of interest towards  large-scale farms and markets.  Lack of communication across food system institutions. Market  cooperatives, governments, non-governmental organizations, and  individual farmers identified major problems with knowledge exchange  and communication across provinces. The language differences between  French- and English-speaking organizations were identified as one reason  why information wasn’t communicated effectively. Departments also lack  the institutional capacity to exchange information with their analogues in  other provinces. NGOs find it difficult to communicate across the multiple  departments concerned with food systems—health, environment, and  agriculture.

All  three Maritime provinces need a  coordinated task force to simplify  communication between groups  and across industries. Government  departments and NGOs  should must commit to cross- departmental, interdisciplinary  commitment to food systems  adaptation research.    A national food policy should  recognize climate change as a  threat to the food system, and  include adaptation planning in its  long-term goals. It should commit  to working at all levels to facilitate  knowledge exchange between food  system actors.

Recognize small-scale farmers’  financial needs as food system  actors. Small farmers have different  requirements than larger industrial  farms. Changing financial support  structures to differentiate between  scales and bringing small farms into  discussions with larger industry  representatives and distributors is  essential.  Provincial support for season  extension is project-specific, and is  due at a time when infrastructure  is already being upgraded on farms.  A number of farmers suggested  changing the funding cycle so that  funding applications are due in  winter rather than springtime: this  would allow farmers to plan ahead  and start building projects before  the production season took over  work hours.   Promote and build on programmes  which already bolster adaptive  capacity. Many farmers pointed  out that certain programmes work,  but don’t receive enough support.  Marketing cooperatives build both  climate resilience and financial  resilience by distributing market  risk across farms; the practice,  however, is relatively unknown in  Nova Scotia and Prince Edward  Island.    Extension agents are useful  links between farmers and  government by providing financial  advice, agronomic expertise, and  horticultural research.  Increasing  funding for extension agencies  would allow for a higher number of  workers on the ground, facilitating  knowledge exchange across the  food system.    REFERENCES
