BC Agriculture Climate Change Action Plan   4     Introduction: BC Agriculture’s Climate Change Action Plan     The BC Agriculture & Food Climate Action Initiative       The BC Agriculture and Food Climate Action Initiative (the ―Initiative‖) is a joint project   of the BC Agriculture Council and the Investment Agriculture Foundation.  Initiative   activities began in May of 2008.  The Initiative is led by an Advisory Committee made up   of agricultural producers and food processors from around the province, as well as   representatives from various government agencies.1       The Initiative was created to: increase industry understanding of the implications of   climate change, respond to and address climate change issues and opportunities,   strengthen agriculture’s climate change networks, act as a forum for sharing resources,   information and tools, and communicate and collaborate with relevant BC government   agencies.  During its two years, the Initiative Advisory Committee has sought to   accomplish, or make progress toward, all of these goals.2      The primary deliverable of the Initiative is this Action Plan which is intended to provide   the BC agriculture and agri-food community with the necessary strategies to meet the   challenges of climate change.  The objectives of the Plan are:       To develop tools and resources that enable BC’s agricultural producers to assess   and reduce greenhouse gas emissions;    To facilitate an increase in economic opportunities (cost savings, revenue   diversification and market competitiveness) associated with GHG mitigation and   clean energy production on BC farms ; and     To develop tools and resources that enable BC’s agricultural producers to   evaluate vulnerability to the impacts of climate change and to integrate climate   change adaptation into decision-making.         The context of Agriculture’s Climate Change Action Plan      The work of the BC Agriculture and Food Climate Action Initiative has existed within a   rapidly changing context.  The BC government has set strong policy direction with   respect to climate change and continues to work toward meeting its emission reduction   targets (including on-going participation in the development of the Western Climate                                                1 For a list of Climate Action Initiative Advisory Committee member organizations, please see Appendix A.   For details regarding Climate Action Initiative activities to date please see Appendix B.  2 From: Climate Action Initiative Terms of Reference, 2008.        BC Agriculture Climate Change Action Plan   5     Initiative’s cap and trade system).  Local governments are now actively engaged in   developing greenhouse gas emission inventories and planning for emission reductions.3        More recently, the BC government released their Climate Change Adaptation Strategy   which outlines priority actions for supporting province-wide adaptation.4  The focus on   adaptation is anticipated to increase in the future.          At the same time, the federal government has a number of initiatives underway   including development of a Canadian carbon offset system, a ―roadmap‖ for climate   change adaptation in agriculture, and various tools and programs (such as the recently   announced Energy Loans program through Farm Credit Canada).        Globally, the economic opportunities associated with ―clean‖ goods and technologies   continue to expand.  While the economic downturn may have dampened political will in    some jurisdictions, there remains a strong momentum in the private sector to create   alternatives to fossil fuels, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to identify associated   diversification and marketing opportunities.  All industries will continue to be impacted   by these shifts and will be challenged to view their businesses in a new way.          The Initiative has also been tasked with looking forward and developing strategic   direction in a time of fiscal restraint.  This context influences how BC’s agricultural   producers view their industry and their businesses, as well as overall capacity to manage   change.  An economic downturn does not diminish the value of this Action Plan and its   goals.  If anything, the economic environment increases the importance of addressing   industry’s capacity to manage risk.  However, the recommended strategic approaches   reflect the current constraints facing both industry and government.         Guiding principles      The Agriculture and Food Climate Action Initiative Advisory Committee (the ―Advisory   Committee‖) has developed a set of guiding principles for the Action Plan.  The   principles serve two important purposes.  First, they reflect the Advisory Committee’s   understanding of the impacts and opportunities associated with climate change in BC.    Second, the principles identify the values that inform the Action Plan and provide   guidance for how the Plan’s goals and strategies can best be achieved.  Therefore, the   guiding principles reflect both what the Advisory Committee has learned through the   planning process, and the values it believes should be carried forward in   implementation.                                                     3  For more information on BC climate actions see: www.livesmartbc.ca    4  http://www.livesmartbc.ca/government/adaptation.html    http://www.livesmartbc.ca/ http://www.livesmartbc.ca/government/adaptation.html      BC Agriculture Climate Change Action Plan   6     Climate change is a growing concern for BC’s agricultural operations    The Advisory Committee accepts that human activity is impacting the climate which is   changing in unprecedented ways.  Climate change, particularly through extreme weather   events, is already impacting agricultural producers and their ability to plan.  Climate   change is also creating greater uncertainty about the future of agricultural operations   and an increasing need for new kinds of information.        Current information and data is insufficient    Over the course of its two years, the Initiative has built a foundation of knowledge that   has facilitated the development of this Action Plan.  However, one of the Advisory   Committee’s important messages is that practical information and data (particularly for    farm level decision-making) remains lacking.  Data systems are needed that are relevant,   timely, accurate and adequately supported. Continuing to build knowledge and improve   data collection is a primary focus of the Action Plan.       A provincial food strategy is required   While this Action Plan supports the agriculture sector in addressing many challenges   and opportunities associated with climate change, there are issues that fall beyond its   scope.  The Action Plan will be most effective if adopted as part of a comprehensive   provincial food strategy that supports the development and maintenance of a sustainable   and secure food system in the context of a changing climate.        Expansion of production capacity is needed   Climate change is anticipated to affect global food systems by resulting in: food   shortfalls, altered trade patterns, population migrations and growing interest more   secure local food supplies.  Within this context, contraction of BC’s food production and   processing capacity is unacceptable.  Rather, BC must seek to expand its capacity for   food production, re-build lost production and processing infrastructure and develop   expertise to serve local markets and to develop new products.        Maintaining competitiveness is critical   Actions or strategies that reduce the economic viability or competitiveness of BC   agriculture will not improve the environmental or social health of the province.  If food   production-related emissions are simply displaced or leaked to other jurisdictions, this   does not support greenhouse gas mitigation objectives or the health of BC’s economy.        Decision-making is influenced by scale   While maintaining a provincial and ―pan-agricultural‖ perspective, it must also be   acknowledged that the impacts and opportunities associated with climate change vary         BC Agriculture Climate Change Action Plan   7     according to geography, capacity and perspective.  Responding effectively to climate   change requires an understanding of the differing circumstances and time horizons   applied at various scales of decision-making.       While it is critical for policy development and sector-wide strategic planning to focus on   long term and province-wide strategic outcomes, the economics of agriculture dictate a   focus on more immediate and localized outcomes.  This means that strategies to support   mitigation and adaptation must take into account how farm level decisions are currently   made and the need for regional and farm scale solutions.  Likewise, factoring longer term   outcomes into investment decisions may ultimately improve the viability of BC farm   businesses.       Success requires collective action   The Action Plan contains the assumption that there is the continued need for the sector   to act collectively.  Due to its significant diversity, at any given moment in time,   commodity groups in BC may be facing seemingly distinct climate change-related   challenges.  For some commodities, managing energy costs is the highest priority, for   others it is adapting to drought and reduced access to water supply.  In all cases,   applying a strategic and coordinated approach strengthens the ability of the industry to   respond effectively.        Partnerships are necessary    In part due to the current economic context, the Action Plan emphasizes the need build   partnerships.  In tackling the challenges associated with climate change, the BC   agriculture sector cannot (and should not) act in isolation.  There is immense potential   benefit in cultivating partnerships with others – across economic sectors, government   departments and jurisdictions – interested in achieving similar outcomes.  Therefore,     there are many strategies and actions in the plan focused in strengthening partnerships.          The scope of the Action Plan      The Action Plan encompasses both climate change mitigation (reduction of greenhouse   gas emissions) and climate change adaptation (planning for, and responding to, changes   in climate).  This reflects the Initiative’s desire to develop a comprehensive plan, as well   as the importance of preparing industry for managing the challenges associated with   both aspects of climate change.         The Action Plan provides both strategic direction and concrete actions.  It is expected to   be a ―living document‖ and to be revisited annually.  While much of the strategic   direction will likely remain consistent, it is anticipated that areas of priority may shift   over time, as may the actions deemed to be most effective in achieving the goals and   strategies.        BC Agriculture Climate Change Action Plan   8     In keeping with the Initiative’s mandate, the Action Plan is pan-agricultural.  Given the   very different issues facing food processors and agricultural operators, it was an on-  going challenge of the Initiative to do justice to supporting both.  It should be   acknowledged that the majority of the Plan maintains a focus on primary agriculture.        However, where possible, the Plan addresses the interests of both.  Consistent with the   Plan principles, the strategies and actions support innovation and economic   diversification for the sector while complementing climate change mitigation and   adaptation objectives.      To develop a Climate Action Plan that is sufficiently comprehensive to meet the needs of   every commodity, region and agri-food business in the province is not realistic.        Therefore, the Plan is not intended to address issues specific to individual commodities   but incorporates awareness that depending on the issue, certain agricultural groups may   experience disproportionate impacts.        The timeframe for implementation of the Action Plan is three years; August 2010 to   August 2013.  Some strategies and actions may take longer than anticipated to   implement and others may be accomplished more quickly.  However, with commitment   from all partners, three years should be sufficient to achieve significant progress in all   areas of the Plan.          The Structure of the Action Plan      The Action Plan is divided into two parts, the first addresses climate change adaptation   and the second climate change mitigation.        Adaptation & Mitigation   To date mitigation has been the driving force behind government climate change policy,   legislation and regulation and it is also the focus of emerging economic opportunities   and incentives.  In response to this, the work of the Climate Action Initiative has also   focused primarily on mitigation – supporting the agriculture sector with addressing   greenhouse gas emissions.  As a result, the mitigation portion of the Plan includes   greater detail and clarity regarding strategies and actions.      However, adaptation is an area of high priority; improving agriculture’s resilience in the   face of climate change is a matter of critical importance, not only for the sector, but for   society as a whole.  It is for this reason that the adaptation section is placed at the front   of the Action Plan.             BC Agriculture Climate Change Action Plan   9     The adaptation and mitigation sections each include: topic areas, goals, strategies and   actions.  Table 1 summarizes the Plan topics and goals.  Tables 2-5 summarize the goals,   strategies and actions for each topic.         Topics   The broad scope of Topic 1, ―Strategic Adaptation,‖ reflects current state of knowledge   regarding agricultural climate change adaptation in BC.  It is anticipated that as the    implementation of the Plan moves forward, more specific strategies and actions will be   delineated.        Before further strategic direction can be defined, improvement of the available   information is required.  Filling the information gaps does not necessarily mean focusing   on climate change models.  What is required is a summary of existing knowledge, an   assessment of the risks and opportunities facing the industry and the identification and   evaluation of options for improving industry resilience.  Therefore, the Plan’s primary   focus for adaptation is on increasing the information available to enable strategic   decision-making.        The mitigation portion of the Plan is divided into three interconnected topics.  The   emissions associated with agricultural production are often distinguished from those   associated with energy and require separate consideration.  For this reason the focus of   ―Farm practices & greenhouse gas mitigation‖ is strategies associated with soils,   livestock and nutrient management.  Nonetheless, in many cases the goals and strategies   identified within this topic will also support work in the area of energy.         Energy is divided into two separate topics to indicate the need for distinct strategies to   accomplish the goals in these areas.  ―Farm energy & fuel efficiency‖ focuses on   maximizing efficiency of energy and fuel consumption and ―Clean agricultural energy   production‖ focuses on increasing the energy production on BC farms and/or with   agricultural by-products.       Goals, Strategies & Actions    The goals are intended to state the outcome that is sought.  In the simplest terms the   goals should answer the question: What are we trying to achieve?   The strategies   articulate how the goals will be accomplished.  The strategies should answer the   question: How do we achieve our goals?        The actions drill down to the level of specific activities.  Actions answer the questions:   What will we do?  What steps will we take?  The actions provide a level of detail that is   generally absent from strategic plans because appropriate actions are determined by   circumstances that change frequently.  However, strategic plans that do not incorporate   this level of detail are frequently left to languish on a shelf.  This is because such plans   fail to translate high level goals and strategies into concrete actions.  It is also extremely        BC Agriculture Climate Change Action Plan   10     difficult to assess progress on goals and strategies.  Therefore, the Action Plan includes   actions but this portion of the Plan will remain flexible and responsive.          Implementing Actions    To provide additional direction regarding implementation, a priority level from 1-3 (one   being the highest priority) has been assigned to each action.  Timelines have been   identified for each action as some activities must necessarily be completed before others.     These timelines are likely to change and require flexibility but they provide an initial   temporal framework.        A lead organization or agency has been identified for each action, along with possible   partners.  These are intended to be recommendations of the Initiative Advisory   Committee and it is understood that implementation will be influenced by a number of   factors.  While it is hoped that the identified leads are the appropriate responsibility   centres, in almost all cases partnerships will be required to accomplish the tasks.        Indicators of Success     Measuring success in implementing this Plan will be challenging because in many cases   results will be difficult to quantify.  More specific and measureable targets will emerge   with development of each action item.  However, it is important to determine how we   define success and to be able to assess progress in achieving the Plan’s goals.  Therefore,   at the end of each set of strategies and actions, is a series of Indicators of Success to   provide a means for evaluating accomplishments over time.

When appropriate adaptations are selected,   they should increase resilience in the face of changes in climate.        Agricultural producers are accustomed to weather conditions influencing their activities.    Decision-making in response to variations in weather is a constant element of farming   life.  Many of the approaches used by farmers to respond to weather are valuable and   applicable in the context of a changing climate.5        Adaptation which utilizes existing knowledge and technology to respond to changes that   are experienced is defined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change as   ―autonomous adaption.‖i  However, climate change creates the potential for variations   and extreme events of a magnitude and scale not previously experienced.  This is likely   to push farmers beyond their existing capacity to adapt.        Planned or strategic adaptation involves a systematic assessment and response to   climate change.  Strategic adaption engages institutions and utilizes planning and   policies to establish or strengthen favourable conditions for effective adaptation.  For   example, strategic adaptation may involve investment in new technologies and   infrastructure.  A broad strategic approach increases the tools available to agricultural   producers to anticipate and manage change.        To be effective at the farm level, strategic adaptation to climate change must take into   consideration broad socio-economic factors, how agricultural producers make decisions,   and in particular, what factors enhance or discourage adaptation.           BC’s climate future     As a land-based industry, agriculture is particularly vulnerable to climatic changes.                                                5  Weather generally refers to the day-to-day or month-to-month state of the atmosphere, including short-  term variation.  Weather identifies what is happening outside (precipitation, temperature etc.) at any given  moment.  Climate refers to statistical weather information over a longer term interval and includes long  term cycles and patterns.  For example, when a region is said to have a cool winter climate, this is based on  years of statistical averages and extremes (30 years is the most common unit for assessing climate).            BC Agriculture Climate Change Action Plan   13     Between 2010 and 2039, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projects   average warming of 1-3°C across much of North America and, beyond this period, annual   warming is expected to increase. The following broad changes are identified for BC in the   report From Impacts to Adaptation: Canada in a Changing Climate: ii       Increasing climate variation and more extreme weather events with an increase   in the associated damage costs    Shrinking of glaciers with many expected to disappear within 100 years; resulting   in serious impacts on water availability and hydrology      Reduction of snow accumulations, particularly at lower elevations    Warming by 2-7°C by 2080 – impacting sea levels, precipitation patterns and   ecosystems    Increasing frequency and severity of wildfires    Increasing frequency and severity of pest, disease and invasive plant outbreaks       These changes are likely to have consequences for food production through impacts to   health and quality of crops, pasture, forests and livestock.   The biophysical changes are   anticipated to result in socio-economic impacts which could also be felt in BC, even if the   more dramatic changes to climate are occurring elsewhere.  Potential impacts include:   declines in yield and production, fluctuations in world market prices for food, changes in    geographic distribution of trade regimes, and an increasing number of people at risk of   hunger.         BC Agriculture and a changing climate      Less than 5 percent of land in BC is suitable for agriculture, which was one of the   primary reasons for the development of the Agricultural Land Reserve between 1974 and   1976.iii However, land continues to be removed from the Reserve and 86 percent of the   land excluded since 2002 has been in regions with the highest concentration of prime   farmland.iv       Some research predicts BC will experience increasing agricultural capability and a   broader range of suitable crops. However, it is likely that climate change will increase   uncertainty and the costs associated with weather damage for BC’s agricultural   operations.  While there is value in assessing future crop suitability, such work must also   include a realistic evaluation of possible changes in precipitation and hydrology, as well   as the current socio-economic context of agriculture in BC.        Although BC agriculture is highly productive, net farm incomes vary widely.  The size of   the operation influences income but regardless of size, many farm businesses are   experiencing increasing input costs and pressure from global commodity prices.    BC agriculture continually faces stiff competition from inexpensive imports.         BC Agriculture Climate Change Action Plan   14     It is estimated that about between 40 and 50% of the food consumed in the province is   imported and a significant percentage comes from California which has recently been   experiencing severe drought conditions.v  As climate change impacts are felt in other   jurisdictions, heavy reliance on imported food may become increasingly problematic and   costly.        Despite the importance of maintaining a viable agriculture sector, to date the issue of   agricultural adaptation to climate change has received little attention in BC.  There is a   critical need to determine how best to support the industry with climate change   adaptation and how to increase food security in the face of a changing climate.        It is beyond the scope of this Plan to address the broader issue of the food security of   British Columbia.  A comprehensive provincial food strategy would set the stage for a   long term commitment to a strong and vibrant agriculture sector with the capacity to   manage the transitions associated with a changing climate.         Progress on climate change adaptation      Within the many published reports that address the topic of climate change, it is   generally acknowledged that agricultural adaptation is a critical issue.6  Yet identifying   adaptation priorities for BC agriculture remains a significant challenge and has not   moved forward as quickly as mitigation activity.        While reducing greenhouse gas emissions is no simple task, climate change mitigation   has clear and measureable outcomes.  GHG mitigation is also increasingly embedded in   government policy and consumer expectations.  There is growing impetus for the private   sector to participate in climate change mitigation (regulatory requirements, economic   incentives, public perception etc).        In some parts of the world – such as portions of Australia – agricultural producers are   experiencing considerable stress as they struggle to adapt to recent climate extremes.  In   much of Canada, there is less immediate pressure to assess the sector’s exposure to the   risks associated with climate change.          While there may be uncertainty regarding the localized impacts of climate change, there   are many adaptations that have the potential support and strengthen the industry   regardless of the specifics of the change.  Identifying and strengthening successful ―no-  regret‖ adaptation strategies is a valuable first step and will also clarify where there are   gaps that require additional attention.  ―No regret‖ measures are those adaptations that                                               6  Amongst the jurisdictions that have focused on adaptation assessments and planning for agriculture are:   Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and California.  The European Commission has also   undertaken a vulnerability assessment for the European agriculture sector.        BC Agriculture Climate Change Action Plan   15     will assist producers to cope with a range of plausible changes and that also have socio-  economic or environmental co-benefits.  Particularly with the uncertainty regarding   climate change, these measures help to ensure adaptation investments are sound.       Perhaps unsurprisingly, much of the dialogue about agricultural adaptation – in all   jurisdictions – has been led by researchers.  Governments are poised to increase their   focus in this area and are likely to begin assessing the impacts of policies and resource   and land management decisions in the context of climate change.  The agriculture   industry will wish to participate fully in this process.  For this reason, adaptation is   defined by the Initiative as being a high priority area moving forward.                                                                                            BC Agriculture Climate Change Action Plan   16     Topic #1 Strategic adaptation     Where are we now?   To date the amount of activity focused on agricultural adaptation to climate change in   BC has been limited.  The BC Ministry of Environment, Climate Action Secretariat (CAS)   leads and coordinates the BC government’s institutional initiatives on adaptation and   provides strategic oversight in this area.        In addition to integrating adaptation into government operations, the Province’s Climate   Change Adaptation Strategy places priority on assessing risk and implementing priority   adaptation in climate sensitive sectors.  The strategies and actions identified below will   be coordinated with, and will complement and strengthen, provincial government work   in this area.       While not defined specifically in terms of climate change adaptation, important   adaptation-related activities have been led by the BC Ministry of Agriculture and Lands   (MAL).  The majority have (appropriately) been focused on water management and the   development of water use planning tools.  This work provides a strong basis for strategic   adaptation – enabling assessments of water use and guiding decision making with this   data is a significant step.        The Environmental Farm Plan Program and Beneficial Management Practices Program   include practices that improve soil quality, increase effective irrigation management and   encourage planting of shelterbelts and riparian areas.  These practices are likely to   increase the capacity of farms to impacts associated with climate change (particularly   changes in hydrology).          The Ministry of Agriculture and Lands and the Investment Agriculture Foundation have   also provided support for economic diversification and sustainable land management   practices (both adaptation strategies) in areas such as Agroforestry, and more recently,   waste to energy technologies.         At the national level, the Canadian Climate Impacts and Adaptation Network   (established by Natural Resources Canada) produced a series of reports on agricultural   adaptation issues prior to its closure in 2007.vi  A handful of high level, multi-provincial   research projects have been conducted with funding support from Natural Resources   Canada, as well as a BC-specific study of climate change impacts on water demand for   agriculture in the Okanagan.vii        In addition, the Agri-Environment branch of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada is in the   process of developing a ―roadmap‖ for agricultural adaptation to climate change.  This   plan may provide a strong framework to guide adaptation activities.  However, it is likely        BC Agriculture Climate Change Action Plan   17     to be relatively high level and more detailed planning at the provincial, regional and   commodity levels will be required.        Where are we going?    All of the adaptation-related content in the Action Plan is found beneath the single topic   heading of ―Strategic Adaptation.‖  This reflects the current level of knowledge and   capacity in the area of agricultural adaptation.  As defined in the introduction, strategic   adaptation is intended to generate a planned and systemic response to climate change.    More knowledge is needed regarding the challenges, risks and opportunities.        The goals, strategies and actions identified below, aim to build the ability to act   strategically in British Columbia.  Agreement amongst partners that this is an area of   priority is necessary, including a commitment to factoring agricultural adaptation into   decision-making at all levels.         A supportive framework of information and resources is required so that planning and   decision-making is informed by an understanding of the potential impacts of climate   change on agriculture.  The strategies and actions identified in the Plan are intended to   increase knowledge and generate tools and resources for the three critical levels of   decision-making (government, industry organizations and agricultural operations).

According to the British Columbia Greenhouse Gas Inventory Report 2007, 3.5% of   BC’s greenhouse gas emissions were attributed to agriculture.viii  Most individual   agricultural operations in BC have low and diffuse emissions and they are unlikely to be   regulated through proposed (Western Climate Initiative) emission thresholds.   The sources of greenhouse gas emissions attributed to agriculture within the inventory   include: enteric fermentation (ruminant digestion), manure management, agricultural   soils (soil disturbance and fertilizers) and cleared range / deforestation.  Food   processing, energy consumption on farms and transportation associated with food   production are currently incorporated into other portions of the inventory.   While the inventory provides a ballpark measure of agriculture emissions, it relies on   standard estimates associated with agricultural emission sources.  This means that, in   most cases, regional differences or operational specifics, such as management practices,   are not incorporated.  This is, in part, due to the complexities described below.           There are three greenhouse gases relevant to agricultural activities: carbon dioxide   (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O).  The agriculture sector contributes a   relatively high proportion of methane and nitrous oxide. Methane has approximately 23   times the greenhouse gas impact of carbon dioxide and is released primarily through   livestock digestion and manure. Nitrous oxide has about 310 times the greenhouse effect   of carbon dioxide and its main agricultural sources are soil disturbance and fertilizer   application. Carbon dioxide itself is primarily released through the burning of fossil fuels   for energy and the operation of farm equipment.         Agriculture’s role in climate change mitigation      Measuring the specific emissions associated with agriculture is complex because of the   range of agricultural practices and the variables of the soil, climate and land cover for   each farm. Nonetheless, there are clear opportunities for emission reductions in   agriculture — many are also associated with long-term cost savings.  When agricultural   producers adjust farm practices and/or technologies to reduce their greenhouse gas   (GHG) emissions or to sequester (store) carbon in soils or vegetation, they are engaging   in greenhouse gas mitigation.         BC Agriculture Climate Change Action Plan   27     In a global context, agriculture is thought to have significant potential for mitigating   climate change in three key areas: through reduction of emissions associated with farm    practices (including management practices and fossil fuel use), through enhancement of   ―removals‖ (by storing carbon) and through displacement of emissions in broader   society through production of clean energy.ix22             Opportunities, challenges & co-benefits        Despite its relatively small carbon footprint, there are multiple benefits to maximizing   efforts to reduce the BC agriculture sector’s GHG emissions.  Government emission   reduction targets are increasing pressure across the economy to reduce emissions.23     Proactive reductions will help to ensure that agriculture remains beneath (future)   regulatory thresholds and may support participation in market niches for low carbon   and green products.  For portions of the industry, reducing emissions may help to retain   or establish competitive advantage, in particular in jurisdictions considering carbon   labels.        Emission reductions may also result in co-benefits including revenue diversification,   improved efficiencies and cost savings.  Among these apparent benefits are opportunities   associated with energy efficiency and clean energy production.  Experience with   agricultural energy efficiency initiatives in other jurisdictions shows that there is   potential for improvement and cost savings this area.  Clean agricultural energy   production results in new revenue opportunities.  Both waste to energy technologies and   other renewable sources, such as solar, wind and geothermal, are well suited to the   agricultural context.        While the inception of the Pacific Carbon Trust signaled the emergence of a regulated   carbon offset market in BC, to date the opportunities for the agriculture sector have been   limited.  However, there is still the chance that more agricultural emission reduction and   removal activities will qualify for offset incentives in the future, as an increasing number   of jurisdictions introduce emission caps and regulations.        With the Western Climate Initiative on track for first phase implementation in 2012, the   value of agricultural carbon offsets is likely to increase.   There are also other incentives   and supports available for agricultural producers interested in emission reduction and it   is likely that these types of supports will continue to evolve.                                                          22   More details regarding specific agricultural practices associated with GHG mitigation is available in Fact   Sheet #3 (Agriculture & Greenhouse Gas Mitigation).  www.bcagclimateaction.ca   23   http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/epd/climate/reduce-ghg/legislation.htm    http://www.bcagclimateaction.ca/ http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/epd/climate/reduce-ghg/legislation.htm      BC Agriculture Climate Change Action Plan   28     Topic #2 Farm management practices & greenhouse gas emissions      Where are we now?    Many of the beneficial management practices already familiar to the BC’s agricultural   producers also contribute to greenhouse gas mitigation.  The strongest existing   mechanisms in BC for supporting voluntary agricultural emission reductions are the   Environmental Farm Plan Program (EFP) and Beneficial Management Practices   Program (BMP).x  The BMP program includes practices that reduce GHG emissions and   is likely to integrate more over time.      Numerous farmers in BC have undertaken incremental GHG reductions and removals   through changes to farm management practices.  Some of these changes include use of   conservation tillage, implementation of nutrient and manure management plans,   improved agronomic practices (such as reduction in summer and bare fallow and use of   cover crops) and planting/integrated management of riparian areas and shelterbelts.      However, thinking of these practices in relation to GHG mitigation is relatively new.    While the linkages between farm practices and emission reduction are known, there is   limited BC-based research documenting specific impacts of farm practices on   greenhouse gas emission levels.        Where are we going?   Encouraging voluntary emission reductions through education, development of effective   programming and technical and financial support are the next steps toward supporting    low carbon agriculture in BC.  Ensuring that the EFP/BMP programs are maximizing   their benefit with respect to emission reduction is a cost effective and efficient option.    Programs that support agricultural emission reductions also have potential (through   data collection) to improve knowledge of agricultural sources and sinks and to contribute   to more accurate inventories at the provincial and local government levels.      In the context of legislated targets and growing consumer awareness, it is also   increasingly crucial that the agriculture sector be able to account for its emission   reductions.  Without measurement – the industry loses a significant opportunity to take   credit for its actions (and to improve access to financial incentives).         Coordinating and prioritizing research on agricultural sources and sinks will enable   focused use of (the limited) resources in this area.  It is currently very challenging for   agricultural producers to assess their emissions and identify options for reductions.    There are also insufficient resources available to guide local and regional governments in   understanding and assessing agricultural emissions and mitigation potential.  For this   reason, the actions below focus on improving availability of educational resources, tools   and technical support.

With relatively small margins and limited capacity to withstand higher input costs, many   agricultural operations are vulnerable to cost pressures associated with fossil fuels.  This   occurs both through direct fuel consumption and through the use of derivative products,   such as fertilizers.  This vulnerability became particularly apparent in 2008, when gas   prices rose rapidly and has also been exacerbated by the carbon tax.     Agricultural operations have diverse sources of fuel (including diesel fuel, motor gas and   natural gas) and the sector consumes a relatively small amount of electricity.  Because   many individual agricultural operations fall below the thresholds for utility Demand Side   Management programs, there are likely untapped opportunities for energy efficiency and   GHG emission reductions at these sites.  Due to the lack of specific, targeted support for   energy efficiency on farms, there is no comprehensive information regarding agricultural   energy/fuel use (benchmarking) and efficiency opportunities in BC.        Where are we going?   Energy efficiency is an issue that delivers generally accepted benefits and numerous   partners have an interest in this area.  This facilitates a positive point of contact with   project partners and agricultural operators to explore broader issues such as energy   production and emission reduction.        A number of jurisdictions have initiated energy efficiency pilot projects or programs that   include on-farm assessments.32  These programs have frequently identified energy   efficiency opportunities.  Modeling on the approaches taken in other jurisdictions, a   partnership has been created between industry, government and the utility companies   (BC Hydro and Terasen Gas) to deliver a BC Farm Energy Assessment Pilot Project.        The pilot project will be completed by autumn of 2010 and will provide a framework for   benchmarking as well as improved clarity about efficiency opportunities and appropriate   resources and incentives to encourage implementation.  It is anticipated that next steps   will include broader delivery of farm energy assessments in BC as well as identification   of mechanisms to support implementation of efficiency practices and technologies on   farms of all types and sizes.       Food processors in the province already have an energy efficiency manager in place to   support assessments of electricity consumption and efficiency. However, the program   focuses on large users and there may be benefits in the production of additional   educational materials, particularly for small and medium sized food processors.                                                    32   Among the jurisdictions reviewed: Maryland, Ontario, Alberta, Saskatchewan, PEI and Massachusetts.

However, if (following the  pilot) assessments made broadly available, it will be possible to develop benchmarks and track progress.    34 This pilot would result in different data and tools/resources from the first pilot project.  Rather than a  focus on delivery of farm assessments, this project would support development of manuals to enable small  and medium sized producers/processors to assess their own efficiency opportunities.

In some cases, there may  also be benefit in on-farm demonstration.    36   It is understood that there are many priorities for the limited funding available for BMPs.  The extent to   which energy efficiency practices are incorporated will depend on priorities and available funds.

While increased energy efficiency will assist the agriculture sector to reduce fossil fuel   consumption, another possibility is alternative sources of energy and fuel.  These sources   would ideally be reliable, renewable and cost-effective.  Particularly when margins are   slim, agricultural producers will not choose risky or costly solutions.  However, many   agricultural operations have the advantage of being able to supply at least some portion   of their own energy or fuel needs.  While this requires up-front investment, the long-  term benefits may be considerable.         To date, much of the clean agricultural energy production activity in BC has been   focused on anaerobic digestion (AD).  Several digesters are either under construction or   in the conceptual stages.  A feasibility study, educational tours and workshops have been   implemented.  In addition, a joint industry/government committee has been established   to facilitate AD projects in BC.  MAL has worked with various agencies to improve   transparency and streamline relevant regulatory processes.  AD technology is a logical   starting point because it is well suited to the BC context, has multiple co-benefits, and   has been proven in other jurisdictions.        These efforts are already expanding to include other technologies and are likely to   continue to grow.  Through its Innovative Clean Energy fund, the BC government has   contributed to several agricultural energy demonstration projects.37  The Agricultural   Research and Development Corporation has partnered with the BC Bioenergy Network   to develop the Renewable Agri-Energy Initiative which is intended advance business   opportunities and overcome barriers to energy production on BC farms.      Both BC Hydro and Terasen Gas have increasing interest in working with agricultural   energy projects.  In 2008, Terasen Gas issues a Request for Expressions of Interest for   biogas production and agricultural producers were amongst the participants.          Despite efforts to date, there are currently few examples clean agricultural energy   production in BC.  This is largely attributable to BC’s relatively low cost of energy   (particularly electricity) which is does not support the level of investment required for   production of agricultural energy.38  Jurisdictions that have successfully developed     agricultural energy have provided start-up grants and feed-in-tariffs.39                                                  37   A complete listing of approved projects is available at:  http://www.tted.gov.bc.ca/ICEFund/ApprovedProjects/Pages/default.aspx  38 This includes rates offered through BC Hydro’s Standing Offer Program which have been insufficient to  effectively enable renewable agricultural energy.   39 Feed-in tariffs support the development of renewable energy technologies through provision of a  prescribed (favorable) price per kilowatt hour of energy generated.  Feed-in tariffs are higher than existing  market prices and are usually guaranteed over a period of time (often 20 years) to provide assurance to  investors.           BC Agriculture Climate Change Action Plan   44     Where are we going?    Energy/fuel production could be a natural extension of many agricultural operations     which possess feedstock in byproducts and crops.  In addition, agricultural operations    often possess the land base to facilitate small scale wind, solar or geo-exchange systems   that are compatible with agricultural production.  In some cases there are revenue    diversification opportunities and in others, producers could acquire independence from   fossil fuels and medium to long term cost savings.       Regional and/or commodity specific approaches would likely benefit agricultural energy   production.  By conceptualizing clean energy production as a regional issue, there is the   potential to partner with other industries in proximity to agricultural operations.     Alternately, collaboration with neighboring farms might enable shared infrastructure or   capital costs.        Another consideration is whether there may be short and long term approaches to   improving energy alternatives for agriculture.  For example, relying on pine beetle wood   to fuel biomass boilers may be a viable short-term solution for some businesses but long   term strategies (for biomass or alternate technologies) will also be necessary.      For agricultural producers to begin investing in energy and fuel self-sufficiency, a   number of shifts are required.  While external factors will influence the rate of change,   producers must necessarily begin to perceive their resources and businesses differently.    Likewise, it is necessary for local governments and communities to increase their   understanding of agriculture and expand their perception of sustainable agricultural   activities.  These shifts in thinking will facilitate the development of economic   opportunities, stabilize agricultural incomes and support more diversified rural   economies.       In order to increase clean energy production on BC farms, the Plan identifies two parallel   and complementary courses of action.  The strategies and actions within Goal 4.1 are   intended to support development of ―farm scale‖ energy and fuel production.  This is   energy and fuel intended primarily for farm use.        The strategies and actions within Goal 4.2 are intended to support the development of   commercial agricultural clean energy and fuel production.  The scale of commercial   energy production will vary but would be sufficient to enable the marketing and sale of   an energy or fuel and to provide a new potential revenue source for the producer.

Outreach   Developing practical and accessible informational resources for producers/processors is   an important element of Initiative activities and has included the following:       Website: www.bcagclimateaction.ca    The website will serve as an information hub for agricultural producers seeking   resources on a broad range of climate change topics.  The site will continue to grow and   evolve as more information is developed and can be shared with industry.        Funding Catalogue    The Funding Catalogue provides a quick reference point on grants and loans available to   assist producers/processors with implementing projects related to climate action.      Fact Sheet Series   Eight fact sheets have been completed to date and two more are under development.   Topics range from carbon offsets to renewable energy technologies. Fact sheets include   background information, associated challenges and opportunities and resources.      Direct outreach to industry   The Initiative Coordinator has spoken with industry groups around the province on a   range of topics, including the Growers Short Course, various AGMs and a panel   discussion at a Canadian Federation of Agriculture meeting.      Contributing to the Policy Dialogue   Amongst the stated purposes of the Initiative is its support role assisting industry to   respond to, and participate in, climate change policy dialogue.        The Initiative has undertaken research and analysis that has supported the agriculture   sector as it has participated in the following consultations:    BC’s Greenhouse Gas Emission Offset Regulations (August 2008)     Greenhouse Gas Reporting Regulations (for operations that will be required to   report within cap and trade) (November 2008)    Canada’s Offset System (August 2009)    Western Climate Initiative White Paper on offsets (August 2009)    Cabinet Committee on Climate Action and Clean Energy (background for   industry submission made April 2010)         http://www.bcagclimateaction.ca/      BC Agriculture Climate Change Action Plan   54     Facilitating partnerships   A key aspect of Initiative activity is building networks and relationships across relevant   agencies/organizations. The background research and analysis conducted by the   Initiative is helpful in identifying where fruitful partnerships might evolve and where   there may be mutual benefits.       In some cases, working relationships will transition from CAI to ARDCorp as business   opportunities or program development opportunities arise.  To date, the Initiative has   maintained contact or built relationships with the following groups:    Ministry of Agriculture & Lands     Ministry of Environment & Climate Action Secretariat    Ministry of Energy Mines and Petroleum Resources    Pacific Institute for Climate Solutions    Abbotsford Soil Conservation Association (Holos GHG Calculator)    Terasen Gas    BC Hydro    Pacific Carbon Trust       On-farm energy efficiency assessment pilot project   The Initiative (along with MAL) has successfully secured partnerships with Terasen Gas   and BC Hydro (as well as the Agriculture Research and Education Corporation and the   Ministry of Energy Mines & Petroleum Resources) to launch a BC on-farm energy   efficiency assessment pilot project.  Through the project, 25 farms from across the   province will participate in high level energy assessments including all fuel types.  The   assessments will identify opportunities for increasing energy efficiency on BC farms.    The assessments will take place between May and July of 2010.
