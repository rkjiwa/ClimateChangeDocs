164  Renewable Energy and Climate Change Chapter 1  Executive Summary  All societies require energy services to meet basic human needs (e.g., lighting, cooking, space comfort,  mobility, communication) and to serve productive processes. For development to be sustainable, delivery of  energy services needs to be secure and have low environmental impacts. Sustainable social and economic development  requires assured and affordable access to the energy resources necessary to provide essential and sustainable energy  services. This may mean the application of different strategies at different stages of economic development. To be envi- ronmentally benign, energy services must be provided with low environmental impacts and low greenhouse gas (GHG)  emissions. However, 85% of current primary energy driving global economies comes from the combustion of fossil fuels  and consumption of fossil fuels accounts for 56.6% of all anthropogenic GHG emissions.   Renewable energy sources play a role in providing energy services in a sustainable manner and, in particu- lar, in mitigating climate change. This Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation  explores the current contribution and potential of renewable energy (RE) sources to provide energy services for a sus- tainable social and economic development path. It includes assessments of available RE resources and technologies,  costs and co-benefi ts, barriers to up-scaling and integration requirements, future scenarios and policy options.   GHG emissions associated with the provision of energy services are a major cause of climate change. The  IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) concluded that “Most of the observed increase in global average temperature  since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations.”  Concentrations of CO2 have continued to grow and by the end of 2010 had reached 390 ppm CO2 or 39% above pre- industrial levels.   The long-term baseline scenarios reviewed for the AR4 show that the expected decrease in the energy  intensity will not be able to compensate for the effects of the projected increase in the global gross domes- tic product. As a result, most of the scenarios exhibit a strong increase in primary energy supply throughout this  century. In the absence of any climate policy, the overwhelming majority of the baseline scenarios exhibit considerably  higher emissions in 2100 compared to 2000, implying rising CO2 concentrations and, in turn, enhanced global warming.  Depending on the underlying socioeconomic scenarios and taking into account additional uncertainties, global mean  temperature is expected to rise and to approach a level between 1.1°C and 6.4°C over the 1980 to 1999 average by the  end of this century.   To avoid adverse impacts of such climate change on water resources, ecosystems, food security, human  health and coastal settlements with potentially irreversible abrupt changes in the climate system, the  Cancun Agreements call for limiting global average temperature rises to no more than 2°C above pre- industrial values, and agreed to consider limiting this rise to 1.5°C. In order to be confi dent of achieving an  equilibrium temperature increase of only 2°C to 2.4°C, GHG concentrations would need to be stabilized in the range of  445 to 490 ppm CO2eq in the atmosphere.   There are multiple means for lowering GHG emissions from the energy system, while still providing desired  energy services. RE technologies are diverse and can serve the full range of energy service needs. Various  types of RE can supply electricity, thermal energy and mechanical energy, as well as produce fuels that are able to  satisfy multiple energy service needs. RE is any form of energy from solar, geophysical or biological sources that is  replenished by natural processes at a rate that equals or exceeds its rate of use. Unlike fossil fuels, most forms of RE  produce little or no CO2 emissions.  The contribution RE will provide within the portfolio of low carbon technologies heavily depends on the  economic competition between these technologies, their relative environmental burden (beyond climate  change), as well as on security and societal aspects. A comprehensive evaluation of any portfolio of mitigation  options would involve an evaluation of their respective mitigation potential as well as all associated risks, costs and  their contribution to sustainable development. Even without a push for climate change mitigation, scenarios that are     165  Chapter 1 Renewable Energy and Climate Change  examined in this report fi nd that the increasing demand for energy services is expected to drive RE to levels exceeding  today’s energy usage.  On a global basis, it is estimated that RE accounted for 12.9% of the total 492 EJ of primary energy supply  in 2008. The largest RE contributor was biomass (10.2%), with the majority (roughly 60%) of the biomass fuel used  in traditional cooking and heating applications in developing countries but with rapidly increasing use of modern bio- mass as well.1 Hydropower represented 2.3%, whereas other RE sources accounted for 0.4%. In 2008, RE contributed  approximately 19% of global electricity supply (16% hydropower, 3% other RE), biofuels contributed 2% of global  road transport fuel supply, and traditional biomass (17%), modern biomass (8%), solar thermal and geothermal energy  (2%) together fuelled 27% of the total global demand for heat. The contribution of RE to primary energy supply varies  substantially by country and region. Scenarios of future low greenhouse gas futures consider RE and RE in combination  with nuclear, and coal and natural gas with carbon capture and storage.  While the RE share of global energy consumption is still relatively small, deployment of RE has been increas- ing rapidly in recent years. Of the approximately 300 GW of new electricity generating capacity added globally over  the two-year period from 2008 to 2009, 140 GW came from RE additions. Collectively, developing countries hosted  53% of global RE power generation capacity in 2009. Under most conditions, increasing the share of RE in the energy  mix will require policies to stimulate changes in the energy system. Government policy, the declining cost of many RE  technologies, changes in the prices of fossil fuels and other factors have supported the continuing increase in the use of  RE. These developments suggest the possibility that RE could play a much more prominent role in both developed and  developing countries over the coming decades.  Some RE technologies can be deployed at the point of use (decentralized) in rural and urban environments,  whereas others are primarily employed within large (centralized) energy networks. Though many RE tech- nologies are technically mature and are being deployed at signifi cant scale, others are in an earlier phase of technical  maturity and commercial deployment.  The theoretical potential for RE greatly exceeds all the energy that is used by all economies on Earth. The  global technical potential of RE sources will also not limit continued market growth. A wide range of estimates are  provided in the literature but studies have consistently found that the total global technical potential for RE is substan- tially higher than both current and projected future global energy demand. The technical potential for solar energy is  the highest among the RE sources, but substantial technical potential exists for all forms of RE. The absolute size of the  global technical potential for RE as a whole is unlikely to constrain RE deployment.  Some RE, including wind and solar power, are variable and may not always be available for dispatch when  needed. The energy density of some RE is also relatively lower, so that reducing the delivered energy needed to supply  end-use energy services is especially important for RE even though benefi ting all forms of energy.  The levelized cost of energy for many RE technologies is currently higher than existing energy prices,  though in various settings RE is already economically competitive. Ranges of recent levelized costs of energy for  selected commercially available RE technologies are wide, depending on a number of factors including, but not limited  to, technology characteristics, regional variations in cost and performance and differing discount rates.  RE may provide a number of opportunities and can not only address climate change mitigation but may also  address sustainable and equitable economic development, energy access, secure energy supply and local  environmental and health impacts. Market failures, up-front costs, fi nancial risk, lack of data as well as capacities  and public and institutional awareness, perceived social norms and value structures, present infrastructure and current   1  Not accounted for here or in offi cial databases is the estimated 20 to 40% of additional traditional biomass used in informal sectors (Section 2.1).    166  Renewable Energy and Climate Change Chapter 1  energy market regulation, inappropriate intellectual property laws, trade regulations, lack of amenable policies and pro- grams, lower power of RE and land use confl icts are amongst existing barriers and issues to expanding the use of RE.   Some governments have successfully introduced a variety of RE policies, motivated by a variety of factors,  to address these various components of RE integration into the energy system. These policies have driven  escalated growth in RE technologies in recent years. These policies can be categorized as fi scal incentives, public  fi nance and regulation. They typically address two market failures: 1) the external cost of GHG emissions are not priced  at an appropriate level; and 2) RE creates benefi ts to society beyond those captured by the innovator, leading to under- investment in such efforts. Several studies have concluded that some feed-in tariffs have been effective and effi cient at  promoting RE electricity. Quota policies can be effective and effi cient if designed to reduce risk. An increasing number  of governments are adopting fi scal incentives for RE heating and cooling. In the transportation sector, RE fuel mandates  or blending requirements are key drivers in the development of most modern biofuel industries. Policies have infl uenced  the development of an international biofuel trade. One important challenge will be fi nding a way for RE and carbon- pricing policies to interact such that they take advantage of synergies rather than trade-offs. RE technologies can play a  greater role if they are implemented in conjunction with ‘enabling’ policies.    167  Chapter 1 Renewable Energy and Climate Change  1.1  Background  1.1.1  Introduction  All societies require energy services to meet basic human needs (e.g.,  lighting, cooking, space comfort, mobility, communication) and to serve  productive processes. The quality of energy is important to the develop- ment process (Cleveland et al., 1984; Brookes, 2000; Kaufmann, 2004).  For development to be sustainable, delivery of energy services needs to  be secure and have low environmental impacts. Sustainable social and  economic development requires assured and affordable access to the  energy resources necessary to provide essential and sustainable energy  services. This may mean the application of different strategies at dif- ferent stages of economic development. To be environmentally benign,  energy services must be provided with low environmental impacts,  including GHG emissions.  The IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) reported that fossil fuels pro- vided 85% of the total primary energy in 2004 (Sims et al., 2007),2 which  is the same value as in 2008 (IEA 2010a; Table A.II.1). Furthermore, the  combustion of fossil fuels accounted for 56.6% of all anthropogenic  GHG emissions (CO2eq) in 2004 (Rogner et al., 2007).  3 To maintain both  a sustainable economy that is capable of providing essential goods and   services to the citizens of both developed and developing countries, and  to maintain a supportive global climate system, requires a major shift  in how energy is produced and utilized (Nfah et al., 2007; Kankam and  Boon, 2009). However, renewable energy technologies, which release  much lower amounts of CO2 than fossil fuels are growing. Chapter 10  examines more than 100 scenarios in order to explore the potential for  RE to contribute to the development of a low-carbon future.  1.1.2  The Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources  and Climate Change Mitigation  Renewable energy (RE) sources play a role in providing energy services  in a sustainable manner and, in particular, in mitigating climate change.  This Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change  Mitigation explores the current contribution and potential of RE sources  to provide energy services for a sustainable social and economic devel- opment path. It includes assessments of available RE resources and  technologies, costs and co-benefi ts, barriers to up-scaling and integra- tion requirements, future scenarios and policy options. It consists of 11  chapters (Figure 1.1). Chapter 1 provides an overview of RE and cli- mate change; Chapters 2 through 7 provide information on six types  of RE technologies (biomass, solar, geothermal, hydro, ocean and wind)   2  The number from the AR4 is 80% and has been converted from the physical content  method for energy accounting to the direct equivalent method, as the latter method  is used in this report. Please refer to Section 1.1.9 and Annex II (Section A.II.4) for  methodological details.  3  The contributions from other sources and/or gases (see Figure 1.1b in Rogner et al.,  2007) are: CO2 from deforestation, decay of biomass etc. (17.3%), CO2 from other  (2.8%), CH4 (14.3%), N2O (7.9%) and fl uorinated gases (1.1%).

The report communicates uncertainty  where relevant.4 It provides the following information on the poten- tial for renewable energy sources to meet GHG reduction goals:   • Identifi cation of RE resources and available technologies and  impacts of climate change on these resources (Chapters 2  through 7);  • Technology and market status, future developments and pro- jected rates of deployment (Chapters 2 through 7 and 10);  • Options and constraints for integration into the energy supply  system and other markets, including energy storage, modes of  transmission, integration into existing systems and other options  (Chapter 8);  • Linkages among RE growth, opportunities and sustainable  develoment (Chapter 9);  • Impacts on secure energy supply (Chapter 9); • Economic and environmental costs, benefi ts, risks and impacts of   deployment (Chapters 9 and 10); • Mitigation potential of RE sources (Chapter 10); • Scenarios that demonstrate how accelerated deployment might   be achieved in a sustainable manner (Chapter 10); • Capacity building, technology transfer and fi nancing (Chapter   11); and  • Policy options, outcomes and conditions for effectiveness   (Chapter 11).  1.1.3  Climate change  GHG emissions associated with the provision of energy services are a  major cause of climate change. The AR4 concluded that “Most of the  observed increase in global average temperature since the mid-20th  century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic  greenhouse gas concentrations.” (IPCC, 2007a). Concentrations of CO2  have continued to grow since the AR4 to about 390 ppm CO2 or 39%  above pre-industrial levels by the end of 2010 (IPCC, 2007b; NOAA,  2010). The global average temperature has increased by 0.76°C (0.57°C  to 0.95°C) between 1850 to 1899 and 2001 to 2005, and the warming  trend has increased signifi cantly over the last 50 years (IPCC, 2007b).  While this report focuses on the energy sector, forest clearing and  burning and land use change, and the release of non-CO2 gases from  industry, commerce and agriculture also contribute to global warming  (IPCC, 2007b).  An extensive review of long-term scenarios (Fisher et al., 2007) revealed  that economic growth is expected to lead to a signifi cant increase in  gross domestic product (GDP) during the 21st century (see Figure 1.2  left panel), associated with a corresponding increase in the demand for  energy services. Historically, humankind has been able to reduce the  primary energy input required to produce one GDP unit (the so-called  primary energy intensity) and is expected to do so further in the future  (see Figure 1.2 right panel).   Within the considered scenarios, the increase in energy effi ciency is  more than compensated for by the anticipated economic growth. In the   Figure 1.2 | Left panel: Comparison of GDP projections in post-SRES (Special Report on Emission Scenarios) emissions scenarios with those used in previous scenarios. The median  of the new scenarios is about 7% below the median of the pre-SRES and SRES scenario literature.

Similarly to the behaviour of primary energy intensity, carbon intensity  (the amount of CO2 emissions per unit of primary energy) is—with few  exceptions—expected to decrease as well (see Figure 1.3 right panel).  Despite the substantial associated decarbonization, the overwhelming  majority of the non-intervention emission projections exhibit consider- ably higher emissions in 2100 compared with those in 2000 (see the  shaded area in Figure 1.4 left panel). Because emission rates substantially  exceed natural removal rates, concentrations will continue to increase,  which will raise global mean temperature. Figure 1.4 right panel shows  the respective changes for representative emission scenarios (so-called  SRES (Special Report on Emissions Scenarios) scenarios; see IPCC (2000a))  taken from the set of emissions scenarios shown in Figure 1.4 left panel.  In the absence of additional climate policies, the IPCC (2007a; see Figure  1.4) projected that global average temperature will rise over this century  by between 1.1°C and 6.4°C over the 1980 to 1999 average, depend- ing on socioeconomic scenarios (IPCC, 2000a). This range of uncertainty  arises from uncertainty about the amount of GHGs that will be emitted  in the future, and from uncertainty about the climate sensitivity. In addi- tion to an investigation of potentially irreversible abrupt changes in the  climate system, the IPCC assessed the adverse impacts of such climate  change (and the associated sea level rise and ocean acidifi cation) on  water supply, ecosystems, food security, human health and coastal settle- ments (IPCC, 2007c).   The Cancun Agreements (2010) call for limiting global average tempera- ture rise to no more than 2°C above pre-industrial values, and agreed to   consider a goal of 1.5°C. The analysis shown in Figure 1.5 concludes that  in order to be confi dent of achieving an equilibrium temperature increase  of only 2°C to 2.4°C, atmospheric GHG concentrations would need to  be in the range of 445 to 490 ppm CO2eq. This in turn implies that global  emissions of CO2 will need to decrease by 50 to 85% below 2000 lev- els by 2050 and begin to decrease (instead of continuing their current  increase) no later than 2015 (IPCC, 2007a). Note that there is a consid- erable range of probable temperature outcomes at this concentration  range. Additional scenario analysis and mitigation costs under various  GHG concentration stabilization levels are analyzed in Chapter 10. This  report does not analyze the economic cost of damages from climate  change.  1.1.4  Drivers of carbon dioxide emissions  Since about 1850, global use of fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas) has  increased to dominate energy supply, both replacing many traditional  uses of bioenergy and providing new services. The rapid rise in fossil fuel  combustion (including gas fl aring) has produced a corresponding rapid  growth in CO2 emissions (Figure 1.6).  The amount of carbon in fossil fuel reserves and resources (unconven- tional oil and gas resources as well as abundant coal) not yet burned  has the potential to add quantities of CO2 to the atmosphere—if burned  over coming centuries—that would exceed the range of any of the sce- narios considered in Figure 1.5 or in Chapter 10 (Moomaw et al., 2001;  Knopf et al., 2010). Figure 1.7 summarizes current estimates of fossil fuel  resources and reserves in terms of carbon content, and compares them  with the amount already released to the atmosphere as CO2. Reserves  refer to what is extractable with today’s technologies at current energy   Figure 1.3 | Left panel: Projected increase in primary energy supply.

Resources represent the total amount estimated to be available  without regard to the technical or economic feasibility of extracting it  (IEA, 2005).   In developing strategies for reducing CO2 emissions it is useful to con- sider the Kaya identity that analyzes energy-related CO2 emissions as  a function of four factors: 1) Population; 2) GDP per capita; 3) energy  intensity (i.e., total primary energy supply (TPES) per GDP); and 4) car- bon intensity (i.e., CO2 emissions per TPES) (Ehrlich and Holdren, 1971;  Kaya, 1990).   The Kaya identity is then: CO2 emissions = Population x (GDP/population) x (TPES/GDP) x (CO2 / TPES)  This is sometimes referred to as: CO2 emissions = (Population x Affl uence x Energy intensity x Carbon intensity)  Renewable energy supply sources are effective in lowering CO2 emis- sions because they have low carbon intensity with emissions per unit of  energy output typically 1 to 10% that of fossil fuels (see Figure 1.13 and  Chapter 10). Further reductions can also be achieved by lowering the   energy intensity required to provide energy services. The role of these  two strategies and their interaction is discussed in more detail in Section  1.2.6.  The absolute (a) and percentage (b) annual changes in global CO2 emis- sions are shown in terms of the Kaya factors in Figure 1.8 (Edenhofer  et al., 2010).  While GDP per capita and population growth had the largest effect on  emissions growth in earlier decades, decreasing energy intensity signifi - cantly slowed emissions growth in the period from 1971 to 2008. In the  past, carbon intensity fell because of improvements in energy effi ciency  and switching from coal to natural gas and the expansion of nuclear  energy in the 1970s and 1980s that was particularly driven by Annex I  countries.5 In recent years (2000 to 2007), increases in carbon intensity  have mainly been driven by the expansion of coal use by both developed  and developing countries, although coal and petroleum use have fallen  slightly since 2007. In 2008 this trend was broken due to the fi nancial  crisis. Since the early 2000s, the energy supply has become more carbon  intensive, thereby amplifying the increase resulting from growth in GDP  per capita (Edenhofer et al., 2010).   5  See Glossary (Annex I) for a defi nition of Annex I countries.    171  Chapter 1 Renewable Energy and Climate Change  Figure 1.6 | Global CO2 emissions from fossil fuel burning, 1850 to 2007.

RE’s contribution to electricity generation is summarized in Figure 1.11.  In 2008, RE contributed approximately 19% of global electricity supply  (16% hydropower, 3% other RE). Global electricity production in 2008  was 20,181 TWh (or 72.65 EJ) (IEA, 2010a).  Deployment of RE has been increasing rapidly in recent years. Under  most conditions, increasing the share of RE in the energy mix will require  policies to stimulate changes in the energy system. Government policy,  the declining cost of many RE technologies, changes in the prices of  fossil fuels and other factors have supported the continuing increase   Figure 1.7 | CO2 released to the atmosphere (above zero) and stocks of recoverable carbon from fossil fuels in the ground (below zero, converted to CO2).

Recently,  developing country annual emissions have risen to more than half of the  total, and China surpassed the USA in annual emissions in 2007 (IEA,  2010f). Figure 1.9 examines the annual change in absolute emissions  by country and country groups between 1971 and 2008 (Edenhofer et  al., 2010).  1.1.5  Renewable energy as an option to mitigate  climate change  On a global basis, it is estimated that RE accounted for 12.9% of the  total 492 EJ of primary energy supply in 2008 (IEA, 2010a). The largest  RE contributor was biomass (10.2%), with the majority (roughly 60%)  of the biomass fuel used in traditional cooking and heating applications   6  In addition, biomass use estimated to amount to 20 to 40% is not reported in of- fi cial databases, such as dung, unaccounted production of charcoal, illegal logging,  fuelwood gathering, and agricultural residue use (Section 2.1).    173  Chapter 1 Renewable Energy and Climate Change  in the use of RE (see Section 1.5.1 and Chapter 11). While RE is still  relatively small, its growth has accelerated in recent years, as shown  in Figure 1.12. In 2009, despite global fi nancial challenges, RE capacity  continued to grow rapidly, including wind power (32%, 38 GW added),  hydropower (3%, 31 GW added), grid-connected photovoltaics (53%,  7.5 GW added), geothermal power (4%, 0.4 GW), and solar hot water/ heating (21%, 31 GWth) (REN21, 2010). Biofuels accounted for 2% of  global road transport fuel demand in 2008 and nearly 3% in 2009 (IEA,   Figure 1.9 | Infl uence of selected countries and country groups on global changes in CO2  emissions from 1971 to 2008.

The annual production of ethanol increased to 1.6 EJ (76 billion  litres) by the end of 2009 and biodiesel production increased to 0.6 EJ  (17 billion litres). Of the approximate 300 GW of new electricity gener- ating capacity added globally over the two-year period from 2008 to  2009, 140 GW came from RE additions. Collectively, by the end of 2009  developing countries hosted 53% of global RE power generation capac- ity (including all sizes of hydropower), with China adding more capacity  than any other country in 2009. The USA and Brazil accounted for 54 and  35% of global bioethanol production in 2009, respectively, while China  led in the use of solar hot water. At the end of 2009, the use of RE in hot  water/heating markets included modern biomass (270 GWth), solar (180  GWth) and geothermal (60 GWth). The use of RE (excluding traditional bio- mass) in meeting rural energy needs is also increasing, including small  hydropower stations, various modern bioenergy options, and household  or village PV, wind or hybrid systems that combine multiple technologies  (REN21, 2010).  UNEP found that in 2008, despite a decline in overall energy investments,  global investment in RE power generation rose by 5% to USD 140 billion  (USD2005 127 billion), which exceeded the 110 billion (USD2005 100 billion)  invested in fossil fuel generation capacity (UNEP, 2009).  These developments suggest the possibility that RE could play a much  more prominent role in both developed and developing countries over  the coming decades (Demirbas, 2009). New policies, especially in the USA,  China and the EU, are supporting this effort (Chapter 11).   Estimates of the lifecycle CO2 intensity for electric power-producing  renewable energy technologies relative to fossil fuels and nuclear power  are shown in Figure 1.13 and are discussed in more detail in Chapter 9.  Renewable energy and nuclear technologies produce one to two orders of   Figure 1.8 | Decomposition of (a) annual absolute change and (b) annual growth rate in global energy-related CO2 emissions by the factors in the Kaya identity; population (red), GDP  per capita (orange), energy intensity (light blue) and carbon intensity (dark blue) from 1971 to 2008.

Most RE technologies have low specifi c emissions of CO2 into the  atmosphere relative to fossil fuels, which makes them useful tools for  addressing climate change (see Figure 1.13). For a RE resource to be  sustainable, it must be inexhaustible and not damage the delivery of  environmental goods and services including the climate system. For  example, to be sustainable, biofuel production should not increase net CO2  emissions, should not adversely affect food security, or require excessive  use of water and chemicals or threaten biodiversity. To be sustainable,  energy must also be economically affordable over the long term; it must  meet societal needs and be compatible with social norms now and in the  future. Indeed, as use of RE technologies accelerates, a balance will have to  be struck among the several dimensions of sustainable development. It is  important to assess the entire lifecycle of each energy source to ensure that  all of the dimensions of sustainability are met (Sections 1.4.1.4 and 9.3.4).  1.1.6  Options for mitigation  There are multiple means for lowering GHG emissions from the energy sys- tem while still providing energy services (Pacala and Socolow, 2004; IPCC,  2007d). Energy services are the tasks to be performed using energy. Many  options and combinations are possible for reducing emissions. In order  to assess the potential contribution of RE to mitigating global climate   change, competing mitigation options therefore must be considered as  well (Chapter 10).  Chapter 4 of AR4 (Sims et al., 2007) identifi ed a number of ways to lower  heat-trapping emissions from energy sources while still providing energy  services. They include:  • Improve supply side effi ciency of energy conversion, transmission and  distribution including combined heat and power.  • Improve demand side effi ciency in the respective sectors and  applications (e.g., buildings, industrial and agricultural processes, trans- portation, heating, cooling, lighting) (see also von Weizsäcker et al.,  2009).  • Shift from high GHG energy carriers such as coal and oil to lower  GHG energy carriers such as natural gas, nuclear fuels and RE sources  (Chapters 2 through 7).  • Utilize carbon capture and storage (CCS) to prevent post-combustion  or industrial process CO2 from entering the atmosphere. CCS has the  potential for removing CO2 from the atmosphere when biomass is  burned (see also IPCC, 2005).  • Change behaviour to better manage energy use or to use fewer carbon-  and energy-intensive goods and services (see also Dietz et al., 2009).  Two additional means of reducing GHGs include enhancing the capacity of  forests, soils and grassland sinks to absorb CO2 from the atmosphere (IPCC,  2000b), and reducing the release of black carbon aerosols and particulates     175  Chapter 1 Renewable Energy and Climate Change  Natural Gas 21.4%  4303 TWh  Bioenergy 1.1%  228 TWh  Concentrating Solar Power  0.005% | 1 TWh  Photovoltaics 0.06% | 12 TWh Geothermal Energy  0.3% | 65 TWh  Hydropower 15.9%  3208 TWh  Nuclear Energy 13.6%  2731 TWh  Coal 41.1%  8273 TWh  Oil 5.5%  1104 TWh Ocean Energy 0.005%  | 1 TWhWind Energy  1.1% 219 TWh  Figure 1.11 | Share of primary energy sources in world electricity generation in 2008.

Additional reductions in non-CO2 heat- trapping GHGs (CH4, N2O, hydrofl uorocarbons, sulphur hexafl uoride) can  also reduce global warming (Moomaw et al., 2001, their Appendix; Sims  et al., 2007).  Geoengineering solutions have been proposed to address other aspects  of climate change, including altering the heat balance of the Earth by  increasing surface albedo (refl ectivity), or by refl ecting incoming solar  radiation with high-altitude mirrors or with atmospheric aerosols.  Enhanced CO2 absorption from the atmosphere through ocean fertiliza- tion with iron has also been proposed and tested (Robock et al., 2009;  Royal Society, 2009).  There are multiple combinations of these means that can reduce the  extent of global warming. A comprehensive evaluation of any portfolio  of mitigation options would involve an evaluation of their respective  mitigation potential as well as all associated risks, costs and their con- tribution to sustainable development. This report focuses on substitution  of fossil fuels with low-carbon RE to reduce GHGs, and examines the  competition between RE and other options to address global climate  change (see Figure 1.14).  Setting a climate protection goal in terms of the admissible change in  global mean temperature broadly defi nes (depending on the assumed  climate sensitivity) a corresponding atmospheric CO2 concentration   limit and an associated carbon budget over the long term (see Figure  1.5, right panel) (Meinshausen et al., 2009). This budget, in turn, can  be broadly translated into a time-dependent emission trajectory that  serves as an upper bound or (if the remaining time fl exibility is taken  into account) in an associated corridor of admissible emissions (Figure  1.5, left panel). Subtracting any expected CO2 emissions from land use  change and land cover change constrains the admissible CO2 emissions  that could be realized by freely emitting carbon fuels (i.e., coal, oil, and  gas burned without applying carbon capture technologies).   The corresponding fossil fuel supply is part of the total primary energy  supply (see Figure 1.14). The remainder of the TPES is provided by  zero- or low-carbon energy technologies, such as RE, nuclear or the com- bustion of fossil fuels combined with CCS (Clarke et al., 2009).   Whereas the admissible amount of freely emitting fossil fuels is mainly  fi xed by the climate protection goal, the complementary contribution of  zero- or low-carbon energies to the primary energy supply is infl uenced  by the ‘scale’ of the requested energy services and the overall effi ciency  with which these services can be provided.   As Figure 1.2 right panel clearly shows, the energy intensity is already  expected to decrease signifi cantly in the non-intervention scenarios.  Technical improvements and structural changes are expected to result  in considerably lower emissions than otherwise would be projected.  As many low-cost options to improve the overall energy effi ciency are     176  Renewable Energy and Climate Change Chapter 1  Figure 1.12 | Historical development of global primary energy supply from renewable energy from 1971 to 2008.

Since then, RE has featured prominently in the United  Nations agenda on environment and development through various ini- tiatives and actions (WIREC, 2008; Hirschl, 2009).  The 1981 UN Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy  adopted the Nairobi Programme of Action. The 1992 UN Conference on  Environment and Development, and Action Plan for implementing sus- tainable development through sustainable energy and protection of the  atmosphere was reinforced by the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable  Development where several RE Partnerships were signed. ‘Energy for  Sustainable Development’ highlighted the importance of RE at the 2001  UN Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD, 2001). Major RE  meetings were held in Bonn in 2004, Beijing in 2005 and in Washington,  DC, in 2008.  The International Energy Agency (IEA) has provided a forum for discuss- ing energy issues among OECD countries, and provides annual reports  on all forms of energy including RE. The IEA also prepares scenarios  of alternative futures utilizing differing combinations of primary energy   already part of the non-intervention scenarios (Fisher et al., 2007), the  additional opportunities to decrease energy intensity in order to mitigate  climate change are limited (Bruckner et al., 2010). In order to achieve  ambitious climate protection goals, for example, stabilization below the  aforementioned 2°C global mean temperature change, energy effi ciency  improvements alone do not suffi ce. In addition, low-carbon technologies  become imperative.   Chapter 10 includes a comprehensive analysis of over 100 scenarios  of energy supply and demand to assess the costs and benefi ts of RE  options to reduce GHG emissions and thereby mitigate climate change.  The contribution RE will provide within the portfolio of these low-carbon  technologies heavily depends on the economic competition between  these technologies (Chapter 10), a comparison of the relative environ- mental burdens (beyond climate change) associated with them, as well  as secure energy supply and societal aspects (Figure 1.14). However,  even without a push for climate change mitigation, scenarios that are  examined in this report fi nd that the increasing demand for energy ser- vices is expected to drive RE to levels exceeding today’s energy usage.  There are large uncertainties in projections, including economic and  population growth, development and deployment of higher effi ciency   Climate Stabilization Goal  CO2 - Emissions Trajectory  Freely Emitting Fossil Fuels Zero- or Low-Carbon Energies: RE, Nuclear, CCS  Carbon Budget (Limit on  Cumulative Emissions)  Share of Renewable Energies in the Provision of Primary Energy Supply  Selection of a Portfolio According to the Following Criteria:  •Economic Competition •Environmental Impacts   (Beyond Climate Change) • Security Aspects • Societal Aspects  “Scale”: Energy Services and Resulting Energy Needs  Energy Efficiency  Figure 1.14 | The role of renewable energies within the portfolio of zero- or low-carbon  mitigation options (qualitative description).     178  Renewable Energy and Climate Change Chapter 1  sources, energy effi ciency and CO2 emissions. REN 21, a nongovern- mental organization, compiles recent data on RE resources based upon  industrial and governmental reports. A new international organization,  the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), was also estab- lished in 2009 and has 149 signatories and 57 member countries 7.   1.1.8  Advancing knowledge about renewable energy  The body of scientifi c knowledge on RE and on the possible contribution  of RE towards meeting GHG mitigation goals, as compiled and assessed  in this report, is substantial. Nonetheless, due in part to the site-specifi c  nature of RE, the diversity of RE technologies, the multiple end-use  energy service needs that those technologies might serve, the range of  markets and regulations governing integration, and the complexity of  energy system transitions, knowledge about RE and its climate mitiga- tion potential continues to advance. Additional knowledge remains to be  gained in a number of broad areas related to RE and its possible role in  GHG emissions reductions.  Though much is already known in each of these areas, as compiled in this  report, additional research and experience would further reduce uncer- tainties and thus facilitate decision making related to the use of RE in the  mitigation of climate change.  Though not comprehensive, a broad and selective listing of areas of antici- pated present and future knowledge advancement is provided in Table 1.1.  1.1.9  Metrics and defi nitions  A glossary of terms is provided in Annex I. Conventions, conversion factors  and methodologies are described in Annex II. A cost table for RE technolo- gies is provided in Annex III.  To have a common comparison for all low-carbon sources, primary energy  is measured according to the direct equivalent method rather than the  physical content method favoured by IEA. The two methods treat all  combustion technologies the same, but the direct equivalent method  only counts the electric or thermal energy that is produced as primary  energy for nuclear power or geothermal power, while the physical content  method counts the total heat that is released. See Box 1.1 and Annex II  where the differences between these methods are described in further  detail.   1.2  Summary of renewable energy resources  1.2.1  Defi nition, conversion and application of  renewable energy  Renewable energy is any form of energy from solar, geophysical or bio- logical sources that is replenished by natural processes at a rate that  equals or exceeds its rate of use. RE is obtained from the continuing  or repetitive fl ows of energy occurring in the natural environment and  includes resources such as biomass, solar energy, geothermal heat,  hydropower, tide and waves and ocean thermal energy, and wind  energy. However, it is possible to utilize biomass at a greater rate than it  can grow, or to draw heat from a geothermal fi eld at a faster rate than  heat fl ows can replenish it. On the other hand, the rate of utilization of  direct solar energy has no bearing on the rate at which it reaches the  Earth. Fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas) do not fall under this defi nition,  as they are not replenished within a time frame that is short relative  to their rate of utilization.  There is a multi-step process whereby primary energy is converted  into an energy carrier (heat, electricity or mechanical work), and then  into an energy service. RE technologies are diverse and can serve the  full range of energy service needs. Various types of RE can supply  electricity, thermal energy and mechanical energy, as well as produce  fuels that are able to satisfy multiple energy service needs (Figure  1.16).  Since it is energy services and not energy that people need, the goal is  to meet those needs in an effi cient manner that requires less primary  energy consumption with low-carbon technologies that minimize CO2  emissions (Haas et al., 2008). Thermal conversion processes to pro- duce electricity (including from biomass and geothermal) suffer losses  of approximately 40 to 90%, and losses of around 80% occur when  supplying the mechanical energy needed for transport based on inter- nal combustion engines. These conversion losses raise the share of  primary energy from fossil fuels, and the primary energy required from  fossil fuels to produce electricity and mechanical energy from heat  (Jacobson, 2009; LLNL, 2009; Sterner, 2009). Direct energy conversions  from solar PV, hydro, ocean, and wind energy to electricity do not suf- fer thermodynamic power cycle (heat to work) losses although they do  experience other conversion ineffi ciencies in extracting energy from  natural energy fl ows that may also be relatively large and irreducible  (Chapters 2 through 7). To better compare low-carbon sources that  produce electricity over time, this report has adopted the direct equiva- lent method in which primary energy of all non-combustible sources  is defi ned as one unit of secondary energy, for example, electricity, 7  See www.irena.org/    179  Chapter 1 Renewable Energy and Climate Change  Table 1.1 | Select areas of possible future knowledge advancement

different primary energy accounting conventions for energy and  emission scenarios.  Primary energy for combustible energy sources is defi ned as the heat released when it is burned in air. As discussed in Annex II (A.II.4)  and Table 1.A.1, there is no single, unambiguous accounting method for calculating primary energy from non-combustible energy sources  such as nuclear energy and all RE sources with the exception of bioenergy. The direct equivalent method is used throughout this report.  The direct equivalent method treats all non-combustible energy sources in an identical way by counting one unit of secondary energy  provided from non-combustible sources as one unit of primary energy, that is, 1 kWh of electricity or heat is accounted for as 1 kWh =  3.6 MJ of primary energy. Depending on the type of secondary energy produced, this may lead to an understatement of the contribution  of non-combustible RE and nuclear compared to bioenergy and fossil fuels by a factor of roughly 1.2 up to 3 (using indicative fossil fuel  to electricity and heat conversion effi ciencies of 38 and 85%, respectively). The implications of adopting the direct equivalent method in  contrast to the other two most prominent methods—the physical energy content method and the substitution method—are illustrated in  Figure 1.15 and Table 1.2 based on a selected climate stabilization scenario. The scenario is from Loulou et al. (2009) and is referred to as  1B3.7MAX in that publication. CO2-equivalent concentrations of the Kyoto gases reach 550 ppm by 2100.  Differences from applying the three accounting methods to cur- rent energy consumption remain limited. However, substantial  differences arise when applying the methods to long-term sce- narios when RE reaches higher shares. For the selected scenar- io, the accounting gap between methods grows substantially  over time, reaching about 370 EJ by 2100. There are signifi cant  differences in the accounting for individual non-combustible  sources by 2050, and even the share of total renewable  primary energy supply varies between 24 and 37% across the  three methods. The biggest absolute gap for a single source is  geothermal energy, with about 200 EJ difference between the  direct equivalent and the physical energy content method. The  gaps for hydro and nuclear energy remain considerable. For  more details on the different approaches, see Annex II.

Hence any  losses between the original sources and electricity are not counted in  the amount of primary energy from these non-combustible sources  (Annex II, A.II.4). Hence, primary energy requirements to produce a  unit of electricity or other work from these sources are generally lower  than for fossil fuels or biomass combustion processes.   Some RE technologies can be deployed at the point of use (decentral- ized) in rural and urban environments, whereas others are primarily  employed within large (centralized) energy networks. Though many  RE technologies are technically mature and are being deployed at sig- nifi cant scale, others are in an earlier phase of technical maturity and  commercial deployment. The overview of RE technologies and applica- tions in Table 1.3 provides an abbreviated list of the major renewable  primary energy sources and technologies, the status of their devel- opment and the typical or primary distribution method (centralized  network/grid required or decentralized, local standalone supply). The  list is not considered to be comprehensive, for example, domestic ani- mals and obtaining energy from plant biomass provide an important  energy service in transportation and agriculture in many cultures but  are not considered in this report. The table is constructed from the  information and fi ndings in the respective technology chapters.  1.2.2  Theoretical potential of renewable energy  The theoretical potential of RE is much greater than all of the energy  that is used by all the economies on Earth. The challenge is to capture  it and utilize it to provide desired energy services in a cost-effective  manner. Estimated annual fl uxes of RE and a comparison with fossil  fuel reserves and 2008 annual consumption of 492 EJ are provided in  Table 1.4.  1.2.3  Technical potential of renewable energy   technologies  Technical potential is defi ned as the amount of RE output obtainable  by full implementation of demonstrated and likely to develop technolo- gies or practices.8 The literature related to the technical potential of the  different RE types assessed in this report varies considerably (Chapters  2 through 7 contain details and references). Among other things, this  variation is due to methodological differences among studies, vari- ant defi nitions of technical potential and variation due to differences  between authors about how technologies and resource capture tech- niques may change over time. The global technical potential of RE sources  will not limit continued market growth.

All connected lines indicate possible energy pathways. The energy services delivered to the users can be provided with  differing amounts of end-use energy. This in turn can be provided with more or less primary energy from different sources, and with differing emissions of CO2 and other environmental  impacts.   8  The Glossary (Annex I) provides a more comprehensive defi nition of this term and of  economic and market potential.    182  Renewable Energy and Climate Change Chapter 1  Table 1.3 | Overview of renewable energy technologies and applications (Chapters 2 through 7)  Renewable  Energy  Source  Select Renewable Energy  Technologies  Primary Energy Sector  (Electricity, Thermal, Me-  chanical, Transport)1  Technology Maturity2 Primary Distribution   Method3  R & D Demo  & Pilot  Project  Early- Stage  Com’l  Later- Stage  Com’l  Centralized Decentralized  Bioenergy4  Traditional Use of Fuelwood/Charcoal Thermal       •   •  Cookstoves (Primitive and Advanced) Thermal       •   •  Domestic Heating Systems (pelletbased) Thermal       •   •  Small- and Large-Scale Boilers Thermal       • • •  Anaerobic Digestion for Biogas Production Electricity/Thermal/Transport       • • •  Combined Heat and Power (CHP) Electricity/Thermal       • • •  Co-fi ring in Fossil Fuel Power Plant Electricity       • •    Combustion-based Power Plant Electricity       • • •  Gasifi cation-based Power Plant Electricity     •   • •  Sugar- and Starch-Based Crop Ethanol Transport       • •    Plant- and Seed Oil-Based Biodiesel Transport       • •    Lignocellulose Sugar-Based Biofuels Transport   •     •    Lignocellulose Syngas-Based Biofuels Transport     •   •    Pyrolysis-Based Biofuels Transport   •     •    Aquatic Plant-Derived Fuels Transport •       •    Gaseous Biofuels Thermal       • •    Direct Solar  Photovoltaic (PV) Electricity       • • •  Concentrating PV (CPV) Electricity     •   • •  Concentrating Solar Thermal Power (CSP) Electricity     •   • •  Low Temperature Solar Thermal Thermal       •   •  Solar Cooling Thermal   •       •  Passive Solar Architecture Thermal       •   •  Solar Cooking Thermal     •     •  Solar Fuels Transport •       •    Geothermal  Hydrothermal, Condensing Flash Electricity       • •    Hydrothermal, Binary Cycle Electricity       • •    Engineered Geothermal Systems (EGS) Electricity   •     •    Submarine Geothermal Electricity •       •    Direct Use Applications Thermal       • • •  Geothermal Heat Pumps (GHP) Thermal       •   •  Hydropower  Run-of-River Electricity/Mechanical       • • •  Reservoirs Electricity       • • •  Pumped Storage Electricity       • •    Hydrokinetic Turbines Electricity/Mechanical   •     • •  Ocean Energy  Wave Electricity   �     �    Tidal Range Electricity       � �    Tidal Currents Electricity   �     �    Ocean Currents Electricity �       �    Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion Electricity/Thermal   �     �    Salinity Gradients Electricity   �     �    Continued next Page      183  Chapter 1 Renewable Energy and Climate Change  provided in the literature but studies have consistently found that the  total global technical potential for RE is substantially higher than both  current and projected future global energy demand. Figure 1.17 summa- rizes the ranges of technical potential for the different RE technologies  based on the respective chapter discussions. These ranges are compared  to a comprehensive literature review by Krewitt et al. (2009) in Table  1.A.1 including more detailed notes and explanations in the Appendix  to this chapter.9 The technical potential for solar energy is the high- est among the RE sources, but substantial technical potential exists  for all forms of RE. According to the defi nition of technical potential  in the Glossary (Annex I), many of the studies summarized in Table   1.A.1 to some extent take into account broader economic and socio- political considerations. For example, for some technologies, land  suitability or other sustainability factors are included, which result in  lower technical potential estimates. However, the absolute size of the  global technical potential for RE as a whole is unlikely to constrain  RE deployment.   Taking into account the uncertainty of the technical potential esti- mates, Figure 1.17 and Table 1.A.1 provide a perspective for the  reader to understand the relative technical potential of the RE  resources in the context of current global electricity and heat demand  as well as of global primary energy supply. Aspects related to technol- ogy evolution, sustainability, resource availability, land use and other  factors that relate to this technical potential are explored in the various   9  The defi nition of technical potential in Loulou et al. (2009) is similar but not identi- cal to the defi nition here in that it is bounded by local/geographical availability and  technological limitations associated with conversion effi ciencies and the capture  and transfer of the energy.

Note also that the various types of energy cannot necessarily be added  together to estimate a total, because each type was estimated inde- pendently of the others (e.g., the assessment did not take into account  land use allocation; for example, PV and concentrating solar power can- not occupy the same space even though a particular site is suitable for  either of them).  In addition to the theoretical and technical potential discussions, this  report also considers the economic potential of RE sources that takes  into account all social costs and assumes perfect information (covered in  Section 10.6) and the market potential of RE sources that depends upon  existing and expected real-world market conditions (covered in Section  10.3) shaped by policies, availability of capital and other factors, each of  which is discussed in AR4 and defi ned in Annex I.  1.2.4  Special features of renewable energy with regard   to integration  The costs and challenges of integrating increasing shares of RE into an  existing energy supply system depend on the system characteristics,  the current share of RE, the RE resources available and how the sys- tem evolves and develops in the future. Whether for electricity, heating,  cooling, gaseous fuels or liquid fuels, RE integration is contextual, site  specifi c and complex. The characteristics of RE specifi c to integration in  existing energy networks are discussed in detail in Chapter 8.  RE can be integrated into all types of electricity systems from large,  interconnected continental-scale grids (Section 8.2.1) down to small  autonomous buildings (Section 1.3.1, 8.2.5). System characteristics are  important, including the generation mix, network infrastructure, energy  market designs and institutional rules, demand location, demand pro- fi les, and control and communication capability. Combined with the   Figure 1.17 | Ranges of global technical potentials of RE sources derived from studies presented in Chapters 2 through 7.

Notes: Technical potentials reported here represent total worldwide potentials for annual RE supply and do not deduct any potential that is already being utilized. Note that RE elec- tricity sources could also be used for heating applications, whereas biomass and solar resources are reported only in primary energy terms but could be used to meet various energy  service needs. Ranges are based on various methods and apply to different future years; consequently, the resulting ranges are not strictly comparable across technologies.

Partially dispatchable wind and solar energy can be more diffi cult to  integrate than fully dispatchable hydropower, bioenergy and geother- mal energy. Partly because of the geographical distribution and fi xed  remote locations of many RE resources, as the penetration level of  RE increases, there is need for a mixture of inexpensive and effective  communications systems and technologies, as well as smart meters  (Section 8.2.1).  As the penetration of partially dispatchable RE electricity increases,  maintaining system reliability becomes more challenging and costly. A  portfolio of solutions to minimize the risks and costs of RE integration  can include the development of complementary fl exible generation,  strengthening and extending network infrastructure and intercon- nections, electricity demand that can respond in relation to supply  availability, energy storage technologies (including reservoir hydro- power), and modifi ed institutional arrangements including regulatory  and market mechanisms (Section 8.2.1).   Integration of RE into district heating and cooling networks (Section  8.2.2), gas distribution grids (Section 8.2.3) and liquid fuel systems  (Section 8.2.4) has different system requirements and challenges than  those of electrical power systems. Storage is an option for heating and  cooling networks that incorporate variable RE sources. For RE integra- tion into gas distribution grids, it is important that appropriate gas  quality standards are met. Various RE technologies can also be utilized  directly in all end-use sectors (such as fi rst-generation biofuels, build- ing-integrated solar water heaters and wind power) (Section 8.3).   The full utilization of variable renewable sources such as wind and  solar power can be enhanced by energy storage. Storing energy as heat  is commonly practised today, and multiple means of storing electric- ity have been developed. Pumped water storage is a well-developed  technology that can utilize existing dams to provide electricity when  variable sources are not providing. Other technologies include fl ywheel  storage of kinetic energy, compressed air storage and batteries. Battery  and other storage technologies are discussed in Chapter 8. If electric  vehicles become a major fraction of the fl eet, it is possible to utilize  their batteries in a vehicle-to-grid system for managing the variability  of RE supply (Moomaw, 1991; Kempton and Tomic, 2005; Hawken et  al., 2010).  1.2.5  Energy effi ciency and renewable energy  Energy services are the tasks to be performed using energy. A specifi c  energy service can be provided in many ways. Lighting, for example, may  be provided by daylight, candles or oil lamps or by a multitude of differ- ent electric lamps. The effi ciency of the multiple conversions of energy  from primary source to fi nal output may be high or low, and may involve  the release of large or small amounts of CO2 (under a given energy mix).  Hence there are many options as to how to supply any particular service.   In this report, some specifi c defi nitions for different dimensions of effi - ciency are utilized.  Energy effi ciency is the ratio of useful energy or other useful physical out- puts obtained from a system, conversion process, transmission or storage  activity to its energy input (measured as kWh/kWh, tonnes/kWh or any  other physical measure of useful output like tonne-km transported, etc.).  Energy effi ciency can be understood as the reciprocal of energy intensity.  Hence the fraction of solar, wind or fossil fuel energy that can be con- verted to electricity is the conversion effi ciency. There are fundamental  limitations on the effi ciency of conversions of heat to work in an auto- mobile engine or a steam or gas turbine, and the attained conversion  effi ciency is always signifi cantly below these limits. Current supercritical  coal-fi red steam turbines seldom exceed a 45% conversion of heat to  electric work (Bugge et al., 2006), but a combined-cycle steam and gas  turbine operating at higher temperatures has achieved 60% effi ciencies  (Pilavachi, 2000; Najjar et al., 2004).  Energy intensity is the ratio of energy use to output. If output is expressed  in physical terms (e.g., tonnes of steel output), energy intensity is the  reciprocal of energy productivity or energy effi ciency. Alternatively (and  often more commonly), output is measured in terms of populations  (i.e., per capita) or monetary units such as contribution to gross domes- tic product (GDP) or total value of shipments or similar terms. At the  national level, energy intensity is the ratio of total domestic primary (or  fi nal) energy use to GDP. Energy intensity can be decomposed as a sum  of intensities of particular activities weighted by the activities’ shares  of GDP. At an aggregate macro level, energy intensity stated in terms of  energy per unit of GDP or in energy per capita is often used for a sec- tor such as transportation, industry or buildings, or to refer to an entire  economy.  Energy savings arise from decreasing energy intensity by changing the  activities that demand energy inputs. For example, turning off lights  when not needed, walking instead of taking vehicular transportation,  changing the controls for heating or air conditioning to avoid excessive  heating or cooling or eliminating a particular appliance and performing a  task in a less energy intensive manner are all examples of energy savings  (Dietz et al., 2009). Energy savings can be realized by technical, organi- zational, institutional and structural changes and by changed behaviour.   Studies suggest that energy savings resulting from effi ciency measures  are not always fully realized in practice. There may be a rebound effect  in which some fraction of the measure is offset because the lower total  cost of energy to perform a specifi c energy service may lead to utili- zation of more energy services. Rebound effects can be distinguished  at the micro and macro level. At the micro level, a successful energy  effi ciency measure may be expected to lead to lower energy costs for  the entity subject to the measure because it uses less energy. However,  the full energy saving may not occur because a more effi cient vehicle  reduces the cost of operation per kilometre, so the user may drive more  kilometres. Or a better-insulated home may not achieve the full saving  because it is now possible to achieve greater comfort by using some of     186  Renewable Energy and Climate Change Chapter 1  the saved energy. The analysis of this effect is fi lled with many method- ological diffi culties (Guerra and Sancho, 2010), but it is estimated that  the rebound effect is probably limited by saturation effects to between  10 and 30% for home heating and vehicle use in OECD countries, and  is very small for more effi cient appliances and water heating (Sorrell et  al., 2009). An effi ciency measure that is successful in lowering economy- wide energy demand, however, lowers the price of energy as well. This  leads to a decrease in economy-wide energy costs leading to additional  cost savings for the entities that are subject to the effi ciency measure  (lower energy price and less energy use) as well as cost savings for  the rest of the economy that may not be subject to the measure but  benefi ts from the lower energy price. Studies that examine changes in  energy intensity in OECD countries fi nd that at the macro level, there  is a reduction that appears related to energy effi ciency gains, and any  rebound effect is small (Schipper and Grubb, 2000). One analysis sug- gests that when all effects of lower energy prices are taken into account,  there are offsetting factors that can outweigh a positive rebound effect  (Turner, 2009). It is expected that the rebound effect may be greater  in developing countries and among poor consumers (Orasch and Wirl,  1997). These analyses of the rebound effect do not examine whether  an energy user might spend his economic savings on something other  than the energy use whose effi ciency was just improved (i.e., on other  activities that involve either higher or lower energy intensity than the  saved energy service), nor do there appear to be studies of corporate  effi ciency, where the savings might pass through to the bottom profi t  line. For climate change, the main concern with any rebound effect is its  infl uence on CO2 emissions, which can be addressed effectively with a  price on carbon (Chapter 11).  The role of energy effi ciency in combination with RE is somewhat more  complex and less studied. It is necessary to examine the total cost of  end-use effi ciency measures plus RE technology, and then determine  whether there is rebound effect for a specifi c case.  Furthermore, carbon leakage may also reduce the effectiveness of  carbon reduction policies. Carbon leakage is defi ned as the increase  in CO2 emissions outside of the countries taking domestic mitigation  action divided by the reduction in the emissions of these countries. If  carbon reduction policies are not applied uniformly across sectors and  political jurisdictions, then it is possible for carbon-emitting activities  that are controlled in one place to move to another sector or country  where such activities are not restricted (Kallbekken, 2007; IEA, 2008a).  Recent research suggests, however, that estimates of carbon leakage  are too high (Paltsev, 2001; Barker et al., 2007; Di Maria and van der  Werf, 2008).  Reducing energy needed at the energy services delivery stage is an  important means of reducing the primary energy required for all energy  supply fuels and technologies. Because RE sources usually have a lower   power density than fossil or nuclear fuels, energy savings at the end-use  stage are often required to utilize a RE technology for a specifi c energy  service (Twidell and Weir, 2005). For example, it may not be possible to  fuel all vehicles on the planet with biofuels at their current low engine  effi ciencies, but if vehicle fuel effi ciency were greater, a larger fraction  of vehicles could be run on biofuels. Similarly, by lowering demand, the  size and cost of a distributed solar system may become competitive  (Rezaie et al., 2011). The importance of end-use effi ciency in buildings  in order for renewable technology to be a viable option has been docu- mented (Frankl et al., 1998). Furthermore, electricity distribution and  management is simplifi ed and system balancing costs are lower if the  energy demands are smaller (see Chapter 8). Energy effi ciency at the  end-use stage thus facilitates the use of RE.   Often the lowest cost option is to reduce end-use energy demand  through effi ciency measures, which include both new technologies and  more effi cient practices (Hamada et al., 2001; Venema and Rehman,  2007; Ambrose, 2009; Harvey, 2009). Examples can be found in effi - cient appliances for lighting, as well as heating and cooling in the  building sector. For example, compact fl uorescent or light-emitting  diode lamps use much less electricity to produce a lumen of light than  does a traditional incandescent lamp (Mehta et al., 2008). Properly  sized variable-speed electric motors and improved effi ciency com- pressors for refrigerators, air conditioners and heat pumps can lower  primary energy use in many applications (Ionel, 1986; Sims et al., 2007;  von Weizsäcker et al., 2009). Effi cient houses and small commercial  buildings such as the Passivhaus design from Germany are so air tight  and well insulated that they require only about one-tenth the energy  of more conventional dwellings (Passivhaus, 2010). Energy effi cient  design of high-rise buildings in tropical countries could reduce emis- sions from cooling at a substantial cost savings (Ossen et al., 2005;  Ambrose, 2009).   Examples from the transportation sector include utilizing engineer- ing improvements in traditional internal combustion engines to reduce  fuel consumption rather than enhancing acceleration and performance  (Ahman and Nilsson, 2008). Signifi cant effi ciency gains and substantial  CO2 emission reductions have also been achieved through the use of  hybrid electric systems, battery electric systems and fuel cells (see Section  8.3.1). Biofuels become more economically feasible for aircraft as engine  effi ciency improves (Lee, 2010). Examples that raise energy effi ciency  in the power supply and industrial sectors include combined heat and  power systems (Casten, 2008; Roberts, 2008), and recovery of otherwise  wasted thermal or mechanical energy (Bailey and Worrell, 2005; Brown  et al., 2005) thereby avoiding burning additional fuel for commercial and  industrial heat. These latter examples are also applicable to enhancing  the overall delivery of energy from RE such as capturing and utilizing the  heat from PV or biomass electricity systems, which is done frequently in  the forest products industry.    187  Chapter 1 Renewable Energy and Climate Change  1.3  Meeting energy service needs and    current status  1.3.1  Current renewable energy fl ows  Global renewable energy fl ows from primary energy through carriers to  end uses and losses in 2008 (IEA, 2010a) are shown in Figure 1.18. ‘RE’  here includes combustible biomass, forest and crop residues and renew- able municipal waste as well as the other types of RE considered in this  report: direct solar (PV and solar thermal) energy, geothermal energy,  hydropower, and ocean and wind energy.   ‘Other sectors’ include agriculture, commercial and residential buildings,  public services and non-specifi ed other sectors. The ‘transport sector’  includes international aviation and international marine bunkers. Data  for the renewable electricity and heat fl ows to the end-use sectors are  not available. Considering that most of the renewable electricity is grid- connected, they are estimated on the assumption that their allocations  to industries, transport and other sectors are proportional to those of the  total electricity and heat, which are available from the IEA (IEA, 2010a).  At the global level, on average, RE supplies increased by 1.8% per annum  between 1990 and 2007 (IEA, 2009b), nearly matching the growth rate  in total primary energy consumption (1.9%).   Globally in 2008, around 56% of RE was used to supply heat in private  households and in the public and services sector. Essentially, this refers  to wood and charcoal, widely used in developing countries for cooking.  On the other hand, only a small amount of RE is used in the transport  sector. Electricity production accounts for 24% of the end-use consump- tion (IEA, 2010a). Biofuels contributed 2% of global road transport fuel  supply in 2008, and traditional biomass (17%), modern biomass (8%),  solar thermal and geothermal energy (2%) together fuelled 27% of the  total global demand for heat in 2008 (IEA, 2010c).  1.3.2  Current cost of renewable energy   While the resource is obviously large and could theoretically supply all  energy needs long into the future, the levelized cost of energy (LCOE)  for many RE technologies is currently higher than existing energy prices,   Figure 1.18 | Global energy fl ows (EJ) in 2008 from primary RE through carriers to end uses and losses.

Even  though the LCOE of a particular energy technology is not the sole deter- minant of its value or economic competitiveness, ranges of recent LCOE  are provided in this report as one of several benchmark values.10 Figures  1.19, 1.20 and 1.21 provide a comparison of LCOE ranges associated  with selected RE technologies that are currently commercially available  to provide electricity, heat and transportation fuels, respectively. The  ranges of recent LCOE for some of these RE technologies are wide and  depend, inter alia, on technology characteristics, regional variations in  cost and performance, and differing discount rates.  These cost ranges in these fi gures are broad and do not resolve the  signifi cant uncertainties surrounding the costs, if looked at from a very   general perspective. Hence, as with the technical potential described  above, the data are meant to provide context only (as opposed to pre- cise comparison).  The levelized costs of identical technologies can vary across the globe,  depending on services rendered, RE quality and local costs of invest- ment, fi nancing, operation and maintenance. The breadth of the ranges  can be narrowed if region-, country-, project- and/or investor-specifi c  conditions are taken into account. Chapters 2 through 7 provide some  detail on the sensitivity of LCOE to such framework conditions; Section  10.5 shows the effect of the choice of the discount rate on levelized  costs; and Annex III provides the full set of data and additional sensitiv- ity analysis.  Figure 1.19 | Levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for commercially available RE technologies covering a range of different discount rates. The LCOE estimates for all technologies are  based on input data summarized in Annex III and the methodology outlined in Annex II. The lower bound of the levelized cost range is based on a 3% discount rate applied to the low  ends of the ranges of investment, operations and maintenance (O&M), and (if applicable) feedstock cost and the high ends of the ranges of capacity factors and lifetimes as well as (if  applicable) the high ends of the ranges of conversion effi ciencies and by-product revenue. The higher bound of the levelized cost range is accordingly based on a 10% discount rate  applied to the high end of the ranges of investment, O&M and (if applicable) feedstock costs and the low end of the ranges of capacity factors and lifetimes as well as (if applicable)  the low ends of the ranges of conversion effi ciencies and by-product revenue.

Monetizing the external costs of  energy supply would improve the relative competitiveness of RE. The  same applies if market prices increase due to other reasons (see Section  10.6). That said, these graphs provide no indication of the technical  potential that can be utilized. Section 10.4 provides more information  in this regard, for example, in discussing the concept of energy supply  curves.  Furthermore, the levelized cost for a technology is not the sole deter- minant of its value or economic competitiveness. The attractiveness of  a specifi c energy supply option depends also on broader economic as  well as environmental and social aspects and the contribution that the  technology makes to meeting specifi c energy services (e.g., peak elec- tricity demands) or imposes in the form of ancillary costs on the energy  system (e.g., the costs of integration). Chapters 8 to 11 offer important  complementary perspectives on such cost issues covering, for example,  the cost of integration, external costs and benefi ts, economy-wide costs  and costs of policies.

There  are countries or regions rich in specifi c RE resources. Twenty-four  countries utilize geothermal heat to produce electricity. The share of  geothermal energy in national electricity production is above 15% in  El Salvador, Kenya, the Philippines and Iceland (Bromley et al., 2010).  More than 60% of primary energy is supplied by hydropower and  geothermal energy in Iceland (IEA, 2010a). In some years, depending  on the level of precipitation, Norway produces more hydroelectricity  than it needs and exports its surplus to the rest of Europe. Brazil, New  Zealand and Canada also have a high share of hydroelectricity in total  electricity: 80, 65 and 60%, respectively (IEA, 2010c). Brazil relies  heavily on and is the second-largest producer of bioethanol, which it  produces from sugarcane (EIA, 2010; IEA, 2010e).  As regards biomass as a share of regional primary energy consump- tion, Africa is particularly high, with a share of 48.0%, followed by  India at 26.5%, non-OECD Asia excluding China and India at 23.5%,  and China at 10% (IEA, 2010a). Heat pump systems that extract  stored solar energy from the air, ground or water have penetrated  the market in developed countries, sometimes in combination with  renewable technologies such as PV and wind. Heat pump technology  is discussed in Chapter 4.   Sun-belt areas such as deserts and the Mediterranean littoral are  abundant in direct normal radiation (cloudless skies) and suitable for  concentrated solar thermal power plants. Export of solar- and wind- generated electricity from the countries rich in these resources could  become important in the future (Desertec, 2010).  1.4  Opportunities, barriers and issues  The major global energy challenges are securing energy supply to  meet growing demand, providing everybody with access to energy  services and curbing energy’s contribution to climate change. For  developing countries, especially the poorest, energy is needed to stim- ulate production, income generation and social development, and to  reduce the serious health problems caused by the use of fuel wood,  charcoal, dung and agricultural waste. For industrialized countries, the  primary reasons to encourage RE include emission reductions to miti- gate climate change, secure energy supply concerns and employment  creation. RE can open opportunities for addressing these multiple  environmental, social and economic development dimensions, includ- ing adaptation to climate change, which is described in Section 1.4.1.  Some form of renewable resource is available everywhere in the world— for example, solar radiation, wind, falling water, waves, tides and stored  ocean heat, heat from the earth or biomass—furthermore, technologies  that can harness these forms of energy are available and are improving  rapidly (Asif and Muneer, 2007). While the opportunities seem great  and are discussed in Section 1.4.1, there are barriers (Section 1.4.2)  and issues (Section 1.4.3) that slow the introduction of RE into mod- ern economies.   The costs of most RE technologies have declined and additional  expected technical advances would result in further cost reductions.  Signifi cant advances in RE technologies and associated long-term  cost reductions have been demonstrated over the last decades,  though periods of rising prices have sometimes been experienced  (due to, for example, increasing demand for RE in excess of avail- able supply) (see Section 10.5). The contribution of different drivers  (e.g., R&D, economies of scale, deployment-oriented learning and  increased market competition among RE suppliers) is not always  understood in detail (see Sections 2.7, 3.8, 7.8, and 10.5).  Historical and potential future cost drivers are discussed in most  of the technology chapters (Chapters 2 through 7) as well as in  Chapter 10, including in some cases an assessment of historical  learning rates and the future prospects for cost reductions under  specifi c framework conditions. Further cost reductions are expected,  resulting in greater potential deployment and consequent climate  change mitigation. Examples of important areas of potential tech- nological advancement include: new and improved feedstock  production and supply systems; biofuels produced via new processes  (also called next-generation or advanced biofuels, e.g., lignocellu- losic) and advanced biorefi ning (Section 2.6); advanced PV and CSP  technologies and manufacturing processes (Section 3.7); enhanced  geothermal systems (EGS) (Section 4.6); multiple emerging ocean  technologies (Section 6.6); and foundation and turbine designs  for offshore wind energy (Section 7.7). Further cost reductions for  hydropower are expected to be less signifi cant than some of the  other RE technologies, but R&D opportunities exist to make hydro- power projects technically feasible in a wider range of locations and  to improve the technical performance of new and existing projects  (Sections 5.3, 5.7, and 5.8).  1.3.3  Regional aspects of renewable energy   The contribution of RE to primary energy supply varies substantially  by country and region. Geographic distribution of RE manufacturing,  use and export is now being diversifi ed from the developed world  to other developing regions, notably Asia including China (UNStats,  2010). In China, growing energy needs for solar cooking and hot  water production have promoted RE development. China is now the  leading producer, user and exporter of solar thermal panels for hot  water production, and has been rapidly expanding its production of  solar PV, most of which is exported, and has recently become the  leading global producer. In terms of capacity, in 2008, China was  the largest investor in thermal water heating and third in bioethanol  production (REN21, 2009). China has been doubling its wind turbine  installations every year since 2006, and was second in the world in  installed capacity in 2009. India has also become a major producer  of wind turbines and now is among the top fi ve countries in terms of  installation. In terms of installed renewable power capacity, China  now leads the world followed by the USA, Germany, Spain and India  (REN21, 2009, 2010).     191  Chapter 1 Renewable Energy and Climate Change  1.4.1  Opportunities  Opportunities can be defi ned as circumstances for action with the  attribute of a chance character. In the policy context, that could be  the anticipation of additional benefi ts that may go along with the  deployment of RE (and laid out below) but that are not intentionally  targeted. There are four major opportunity areas that RE is well suited  to address, and these are briefl y described here and in more detail in  Section 9.2.2. The four areas are social and economic development,  energy access, energy security, and climate change mitigation and the  reduction of environmental and health impacts.  1.4.1.1  Social and economic development  Globally, per capita incomes as well as broader indicators such as the  Human Development Index are positively correlated with per capita  energy use, and economic growth can be identifi ed as the most relevant  factor behind increasing energy consumption in the last decades. As  economic activity expands and diversifi es, demands for more sophis- ticated and fl exible energy sources arise. Economic development has  therefore been associated with a shift from direct combustion of fuels  to higher quality electricity (Kaufmann, 2004; see Section 9.3.1).   Particularly for developing countries, the link between social and  economic development and the need for modern energy services is  evident. Access to clean and reliable energy constitutes an important  prerequisite for fundamental determinants of human development,  contributing, inter alia, to economic activity, income generation, pov- erty alleviation, health, education and gender equality (Kaygusuz,  2007; UNDP, 2007). Because of their decentralized nature, RE tech- nologies can play an important role in fostering rural development  (see Section 1.4.1.2).   The creation of (new) employment opportunities is seen as a positive  long-term effect of RE both in developed and developing countries  and was stressed in many national green-growth strategies. Also, poli- cymakers have supported the development of domestic markets for RE  as a means to gain competitive advantage in supplying international  markets (see Sections 9.3.1.4 and 11.3.4).  1.4.1.2  Energy access  In 2009, more than 1.4 billion people globally lacked access to electric- ity, 85% of them in rural areas, and the number of people relying on  traditional biomass for cooking was estimated to be around 2.7 billion  (IEA, 2010c). By 2015, almost 1.2 billion more people will need access  to electricity and 1.9 billion more people will need access to modern  fuels to meet the Millennium Development Goal of halving the propor- tion of people living in poverty (UNDP/WHO, 2009).  The transition to modern energy access is referred to as moving up the  energy ladder and implies a progression from traditional to more mod- ern devices/fuels that are more environmentally benign and have fewer  negative health impacts. Various initiatives, some of them based on RE,  particularly in the developing countries, aim at improving universal access  to modern energy services through increased access to electricity and  cleaner cooking facilities (REN 21, 2009; see Sections 9.3.2 and 11.3.2).  In particular, reliance on RE in rural applications, use of locally produced  bioenergy to produce electricity, and access to clean cooking facilities will  contribute to attainment of universal access to modern energy services  (IEA, 2010d).   For electricity, small and standalone confi gurations of RE technologies  such as PV (Chapter 3), hydropower (Chapter 5), and bioenergy (Chapter  2) can often meet energy needs of rural communities more cheaply than  fossil fuel alternatives such as diesel generators. For example, PV is  attractive as a source of electric power to provide basic services, such as  lighting and clean drinking water. For greater local demand, small-scale  hydropower or biomass combustion and gasifi cation technologies may  offer better solutions (IEA, 2010d). For bioenergy, the progression implies  moving from the use of, for example, fi rewood, cow dung and agricultural  residues to, for example, liquid propane gas stoves, RE-based advanced  biomass cookstoves or biogas systems (Clancy et al., 2007; UNDP, 2005;  IEA, 2010d; see Sections 2.4.2 and 9.3.2).   1.4.1.3  Energy security  At a general level, energy security can best be understood as robustness  against (sudden) disruptions of energy supply. More specifi cally, avail- ability and distribution of resources, as well as variability and reliability  of energy supply can be identifi ed as the two main themes.  Current energy supplies are dominated by fossil fuels (petroleum and  natural gas) whose price volatility can have signifi cant impacts, in par- ticular for oil-importing developing countries (ESMAP, 2007). National  security concerns about the geopolitical availability of fuels have also  been a major driver for a number of countries to consider RE. For exam- ple, in the USA, the military has led the effort to expand and diversify fuel  supplies for aviation and cites improved energy supply security as the  major driving force for sustainable alternative fuels (Hileman et al., 2009;  Secretary of the Air Force, 2009; USDOD, 2010).   Local RE options can contribute to energy security goals by means of  diversifying energy supplies and diminishing dependence on limited sup- pliers, although RE-specifi c challenges to integration must be considered.  In addition, the increased uptake of RE technologies could be an avenue  to redirect foreign exchange fl ows away from energy imports towards  imports of goods that cannot be produced locally, such as high-tech capi- tal goods. This may be particularly important for oil-importing developing  countries with high import shares (Sections 9.3.3, 9.4.3 and 11.3.3).     192  Renewable Energy and Climate Change Chapter 1  1.4.1.4  Climate change mitigation and reduction of  environmental and health impacts  Climate change mitigation is one of the key driving forces behind a  growing demand for RE technologies (see Section 11.3.1). In addition  to reducing GHG emissions, RE technologies can also offer benefi ts with  respect to air pollution and health compared to fossil fuels (see Section  9.3.4). Despite these important advantages of RE, no large-scale technol- ogy deployment comes without trade-offs, such as, for example, induced  land use change. This mandates an assessment of the overall burden  from the energy system on the environment and society, taking account  of the broad range of impact categories with the aim of identifying pos- sible trade-offs and potential synergies.   Lifecycle assessments facilitate a quantitative comparison of ‘cradle  to grave’ emissions across different energy technologies (see Section  9.3.4.1). Figure 1.22 illustrates the lifecycle structure for CO2 emission  analysis, and qualitatively indicates the relative GHG implications for RE,  nuclear power and fossil fuels. Alongside the commonly known CO2 pro- duction pathways from fossil fuel combustion, natural gas production  (and transportation) and coal mines are a source of methane, a potent  greenhouse gas, and uncontrolled coal mine fi res release signifi cant  amounts of CO2 to the atmosphere.   Traditional biomass use results in health impacts from the high con- centrations of particulate matter and carbon monoxide, among other  pollutants. Long-term exposure to biomass smoke increases the risk  of a child developing an acute respiratory infection and is a major  cause of morbidity and mortality in developing countries (WEC/FAO,  1999).  In this context, non-combustion-based RE power generation technolo- gies have the potential to signifi cantly reduce local and regional air  pollution and lower associated health impacts compared to fossil- based power generation. Improving traditional biomass use can reduce  negative impacts on sustainable development, including local and  indoor air pollution, GHG emissions, deforestation and forest degrada- tion (see Sections 2.5.4, 9.3.4.2, 9.3.4.3 and 9.4.2).  Impacts on water resources from energy systems strongly depend on  technology choice and local conditions. Electricity production with  wind and solar PV, for example, requires very little water compared to  thermal conversion technologies, and has no impacts on water quality.  Limited water availability for cooling thermal power plants decreases  their effi ciency, which can affect plants operating on coal, biomass, gas,  nuclear and concentrating solar power (see Section 9.3.4.4). There have  been signifi cant power reductions from nuclear and coal plants during  drought conditions in the USA and France in recent years.   Surface-mined coal in particular produces major alterations of land; coal  mines can create acid mine drainage and the storage of coal ash can con- taminate surface and ground waters. Oil production and transportation   have lead to signifi cant land and water spills. Most renewable technolo- gies produce lower conventional air and water pollutants than fossil  fuels, but may require large amounts of land as, for example, reservoir  hydropower (which can also release methane from submerged vegeta- tion), wind energy and biofuels (see Section 9.3.4.5).   Since a degree of climate change is now inevitable, adaptation to cli- mate change is an essential component of sustainable development  (IPCC, 2007e). Adaptation can be either anticipatory or reactive to an  altered climate. Some RE technologies may assist in adapting to change,  and are usually anticipatory in nature. AR4 includes a chapter on the  linkage between climate mitigation (reducing emissions of GHGs) and  climate adaptation including the potential to assist adaptation to cli- mate change (Klein et al., 2007a, b).  • Active and passive solar cooling of buildings helps counter the   direct impacts on humans of rising mean temperatures (Chapter 3);  • Dams (used for hydropower) may also be important in managing the  impacts of droughts and fl oods, which are projected to increase with  climate change. Indeed, this is one of reasons for building such dams  in the fi rst place (Section 5.10; see also World Commission on Dams  (WCD, 2000);   • Solar PV and wind require no water for their operation, and hence may  become increasingly important as droughts and high river tempera- tures limit the power output of thermal power plants (Section 9.3.4);  • Water pumps in rural areas remote from the power grid can utilize PV  (Chapter 3) or wind (Chapter 7) for raising agricultural productivity  during climate-induced increases in dry seasons and droughts; and  • Tree planting and forest preservation along coasts and riverbanks is  a key strategy for lessening the coastal erosion impacts of climate  change. With suitable choice of species and silvicultural practices,  these plantings can also yield a sustainable source of biomass for  energy, for example, by coppicing (Section 2.5).  1.4.2  Barriers  A barrier was defi ned in the AR4 as ‘any obstacle to reaching a goal,  adaptation or mitigation potential that can be overcome or attenuated  by a policy, programme or measure’(IPCC, 2007d; Verbruggen et al.,  2010). For example, the technology as currently available may not suit  the desired scale of application. This barrier could be attenuated in prin- ciple by a program of technology development (R&D).   This section describes some of the main barriers and issues to using RE  for climate change mitigation, adaptation and sustainable development.  As throughout this introductory chapter, the examples are illustrative  and not comprehensive. Section 1.5 (briefl y) and Section 11.4 (in more     193  Chapter 1 Renewable Energy and Climate Change  Energy Conversion  Biomass for Energy  Recovery & Extraction  Nuclear  Renewable  Fossil Raw Material Movement  Electricity Distribution  Liquid Fuel Transportation  Product  Conversion  Co-ProductBiomass Co-Product  Residental  Commercial  Electric Transportation  Fuel Combustion  Gasoline/Ethanol  Bunker Fuel  Jet Fuel  Transportation Productivity  Transportation Productivity  Economic Productivity  Diesel Fuel  Electricity Consumption  CO2  GHG  GHG  GHG GHG  GHG  GHG  GHG  GHG  Agriculture,  Forestry, Residues  Figure 1.22 | Illustrative system for energy production and use illustrating the role of RE along with other production options.

When a barrier is particularly pertinent to a specifi c technology, it  is examined in the appropriate technology chapter (i.e., Chapters 2 to 7).   The various barriers are categorized as 1) market failures and economic  barriers, 2) information and awareness barriers, 3) socio-cultural barriers  and 4) institutional and policy barriers (see Table 1.5). This categoriza- tion is somewhat arbitrary since, in many cases, barriers extend across  several categories. More importantly, for a particular project or set of  circumstances it will usually be diffi cult to single out one particular bar- rier. They are interrelated and need to be dealt with in a comprehensive  manner.   1.4.2.1  Market failures and economic barriers  Market Failures In economics a distinction is often made between market failures and  barriers. With reference to the theoretical ideal market conditions  (Debreu, 1959; Becker, 1971), all real-life markets fail to some degree  (Bator, 1958; Meade, 1971; Williamson, 1985), evidenced by losses in  welfare. Market failures (imperfections) are often due to externalities or  external effects. These arise from a human activity when agents respon- sible for the activity do not take full account of the activity’s impact on  others. Externalities may be negative (external costs) or positive (exter- nal benefi ts). External benefi ts lead to an undersupply of benefi cial     194  Renewable Energy and Climate Change Chapter 1  activities (e.g., public goods) from a societal point of view because the  producer is not fully rewarded. External costs lead to a too-high demand  for harmful activities because the consumer does not bear the full (soci- etal) cost. Another market failure is rent appropriation by monopolistic  entities. In the case of RE deployment, these may appear as:  • Underinvestment in invention and innovation in RE technologies  because initiators cannot benefi t from exclusive property rights for  their efforts (Margolis and Kammen, 1999; Foxon and Pearson, 2008).  • Un-priced environmental impacts and risks of energy use when  economic agents have no obligation to internalize the full costs of  their actions (Beck, 1995; Baumol and Oates, 1998). The release of  GHG emissions and the resulting climate change is a clear example  (Stern, 2007; Halsnaes et al., 2008), but the impacts and risks of  some RE projects and of other low-carbon technologies (nuclear,  CCS) may not always be fully priced either.  • The occurrence of monopoly (one seller) or monopsony (one buyer)  powers in energy markets limits competition among suppliers or  demanders and reduces opportunities for free market entry and exit  (see Section 1.4.2.4). Monopoly and oligopoly power may be due to  deliberate concentration, control and collusion. Regulated intercon- nected network industries (e.g., electric, gas and heat transmission  grids) within a given area are natural monopolies because network    services are least-cost when provided by a single operator (Baumol  et al., 1982, p.135).   Characterizing these imperfections as market failures, with high like- lihoods of welfare losses and of the impotence of market forces in  clearing the imperfections, provides strong economic arguments for  public policy intervention to repair the failures (Coase, 1960; Bromley,  1986). On top of imperfections classifi ed as market failures, various fac- tors affect the behaviour of market agents, and are categorized here as  other types of barriers.   Up-front Investment Cost The initial investment cost of a unit of RE capacity may be higher  than for a non-RE energy system. Because the cost of such systems is  largely up-front, it would be unaffordable to most potential custom- ers, especially in developing countries, unless a fi nancial mechanism is  established to allow them to pay for the RE energy service month by   month as they do for kerosene. Even if the initial equipment is donated  by an overseas agency, such a fi nancial mechanism is still needed to  pay for the technical support, spare parts and eventual replacement  of the system. Failure to have these institutional factors properly set  up has been a major inhibitor to the use of RE in the Pacifi c Islands,  where small-scale PV systems would appear to be a natural fi t to the  scattered tropical island communities (Johnston and Vos, 2005; Chaurey  and Kandpal, 2010).  Financial risk  All power projects carry fi nancial risk because of uncertainty in future  electricity prices, regardless of its source, making it diffi cult for a private  or public investor to anticipate future fi nancial returns on investment.  Moreover, the fi nancial viability of an RE system strongly depends on  the availability of capital and its cost (interest rates) because the ini- tial capital cost comprises most of the economic cost of an RE system.  While the predictability of such costs is a relative advantage of RE sys- tems, many RE technologies are still in their early development phase,  so that the risks related to the fi rst commercial projects are high. The  private capital market requires higher returns for such risky investments  than for established technologies, raising the cost of RE projects (Gross  et al., 2010; Bazilian and Roques, 2008).  An example of fi nancial risk from an RE system outside the power sector  is the development of biofuels for aviation. In 2009, neither the poten- tial bio-jet fuel refi ners nor the airlines fully understood how to structure  a transaction that was credit worthy and as a result might get fi nanced if  there were interested fi nancial institutions. (Slade et al., 2009)  1.4.2.2  Informational and awareness barriers  Defi cient data about natural resources  RE is widely distributed but is site-specifi c in a way that fossil fuel sys- tems are not. For example, the output of a wind turbine depends strongly  on the wind regime at that place, unlike the output of a diesel generator.  While broad-scale data on wind is reasonably well available from mete- orological records, it takes little account of local topography, which may  mean that the output of a particular turbine could be 10 to 50 % higher  on top of a local hill than in the valley a few hundred metres away  (Petersen et al., 1998). To obtain such site-specifi c data requires onsite  measurement for at least a year and/or detailed modelling. Similar data   Table 1.5 | A categorization of barriers to RE deployment  Section Type of barrier Some potential policy instruments  (see Chapter 11)  1.4.2.1 Market failures and economic barriers Carbon taxes, emission trading schemes, public support for R&D, economic climate that supports investment,  microfi nance  1.4.2.2 Information and awareness barriers Energy standards, information campaigns, technical training  1.4.2.3 Socio-cultural barriers Improved processes for land use planning  1.4.2.4 Institutional and policy barriers Enabling environment for innovation, revised technical regulations, international support for technology transfer  (e.g., under the UNFCCC), liberalization of energy industries    195  Chapter 1 Renewable Energy and Climate Change  defi ciencies apply to most RE resources, but can be attenuated by specifi c  programs to better measure those resources (Hammer et al., 2003).  Skilled human resources (capacity) To develop RE resources takes skills in mechanical, chemical and electri- cal engineering, business management and social science, as with other  energy sources. But the required skill set differs in detail for different  technologies and people require specifi c training. Developing the skills  to operate and maintain the RE ‘hardware’ is exceedingly important  for a successful RE project (Martinot, 1998). Where these barriers are  overcome as in Bangladesh, signifi cant installations of RE systems in  developing countries has occurred (Barua et al., 2001; Ashden Awards for  Sustainable Energy, 2008; Mondal et al., 2010). It is also important that  the user of RE technology understand the specifi c operational aspects  and availability of the RE source. One case where this is important is  in the rural areas of developing countries. Technical support for dis- persed RE, such as PV systems in the rural areas of developing countries,  requires many people with basic technical skill rather than a few with  high technical skill as tends to be the case with conventional energy  systems. Training such people and ensuring that they have ready access  to spare parts requires establishment of new infrastructure.   More generally, in some developing countries, the lack of an ancillary  industry for RE (such as specialized consulting, engineering and procure- ment, maintenance, etc.) implies higher costs for project development  and is an additional barrier to deployment.   Public and institutional awareness  The oil (and gas) price peaks of 1973, 1980, 1991 and 2008 made con- sumers, governments and industry in both industrialized and developing  counties search for alternative sources of energy. While these price surges  caused some shift to coal for power production, they also generated  actions to adopt more RE, especially solar, wind and biomass (Rout et al.,  2008; van Ruijven and van Vuuren, 2009; Chapter 7). There is, however,  limited awareness of the technical and fi nancial issues of implementing  a sustained transition to alternative primary energy sources—especially  RE (Henriques and Sadorsky, 2008). The economic and transactional  costs of shifting away from vulnerable and volatile fossil fuels like oil are  overestimated, and there is always a shift back to these fuels once price  shocks abate. The reluctance to make a shift away from a known energy  source is very high because of institutional, economic and social lock-in  (Unruh and Carillo-Hermosilla, 2006). One means of motivation might be  a realization that the economic welfare cost of high oil prices exceeds  that of effective climate polices (Viguier and Vielle, 2007).   1.4.2.3  Socio-cultural barriers  Socio-cultural barriers or concerns have different origins and are intrinsi- cally linked to societal and personal values and norms. Such values and  norms affect the perception and acceptance of RE technologies and the   potential impacts of their deployment by individuals, groups and societ- ies. Barriers may arise from inadequate attention to such socio-cultural  concerns and may relate to impacts on behaviour, natural habitats and  natural and human heritage sites, including impacts on biodiversity and  ecosystems, landscape aesthetics, and water/land use and water/land  use rights as well as their availability for competing uses (see Section  9.5.1.1).   Farmers on whose land wind farms are built rarely object; in fact they  usually see turbines as a welcome extra source of income either as own- ers (Denmark) or as leasers of their land (USA), as they can continue to  carry on agricultural and grazing activities beneath the turbines. Other  forms of RE, however, preclude multiple uses of the land (Kotzebue et  al., 2010). Dams for hydropower compete for recreational or scenic use  of rivers (Hynes and Hanley, 2006), and the reservoirs may remove land  from use for agriculture, forests or urban development. Large-scale solar  or wind may confl ict with other values (Simon, 2009) and may confl ict  with other social values of land such as nature preserves or scenic vis- tas (Groothuis et al., 2008; Valentine, 2010). Specifi c projects may also  have negative implications for poor populations (Mariita, 2002). Land  use can be just as contentious in some developing countries. In Papua  New Guinea, for example, villagers may insist on being paid for the use  of their land, for example, for a mini-hydro system of which they are the  sole benefi ciaries (Johnston and Vos, 2005).   Hence, social acceptance is an important element in the need to rapidly  and signifi cantly scale up RE deployment to help meet climate change  mitigation goals, as large-scale implementation can only be successfully  undertaken with the understanding and support of the public. Social  acceptance of RE is generally increasing; having domestic solar energy  PV or domestic hot water systems on one’s roof has become a mark of  the owner’s environmental commitment (Bruce et al., 2009). However,  wind farms still have to battle local opposition before they can be estab- lished (Pasqualetti et al., 2002; Klick and Smith, 2010; Webler and Tuler,  2010) and there is opposition to aboveground transmission lines from  larger-scale renewable generation facilities (as well as from conventional  power sources) (Furby et al., 1988; Hirst and Kirby, 2001; Gerlach, 2004;  Vajjhala and Fischbeck, 2007; Puga and Lesser, 2009).   To overcome such barriers may require dedicated communication efforts  related to such subjective and psychological aspects as well as the more  objective opportunities associated with wider-scale applications of RE  technologies. At the same time, public participation in planning decisions  as well as fairness and equity considerations in the distribution of the  benefi ts and costs of RE deployment play an equally important role and  cannot be side-stepped (see Section 9.5.2). See Chapters 7 and 11 for  more discussion of how such local planning issues impact the uptake of  RE. Chapter 11 also includes a wider discussion of the enabling social  and institutional environment required for the transition to RE systems.  Opposition to unwanted projects can be infl uenced by policies but social  acceptance may be slow to change.     196  Renewable Energy and Climate Change Chapter 1  1.4.2.4  Institutional and policy barriers  Existing industry, infrastructure and energy market regulation Apart from constituting a market failure (see above), monopoly  power can be perceived as an institutional barrier if not addressed  adequately by energy market regulation.   The energy industry in most countries is based on a small number  of companies (sometimes only one in a particular segment such as  electricity or gas supply) operating a highly centralized infrastruc- ture. These systems evolved as vertically integrated monopolies that  may become committed to large conventional central power facilities  supported by policies to ensure they deliver affordable and reliable  electricity or gas. They are sometimes unreceptive to distributed  smaller supply technologies (World Bank, 2006).  Therefore, regulations governing energy businesses in many countries  are still designed around monopoly or near-monopoly providers and  technical regulations and standards have evolved under the assump- tion that energy systems are large and centralized and of high power  density and/or high voltage, and may therefore be unnecessarily  restrictive for RE systems. In the process of historical development,  most of the rules governing sea lanes and coastal areas were writ- ten long before offshore wind power and ocean energy systems were  being developed and do not consider the possibility of multiple uses  that include such systems (See Chapter 7).  Liberalization of energy markets occurred in several countries in the  1990s and more extensively in Europe in the past decade. Some of  these changes in regulations allow independent power producers to  operate, although in the USA many smaller proposed RE projects were  often excluded due to the scales required by regulation (Markard  and Truffer, 2006). In many countries, current regulations remain that  protect the dominant centralized production, transmission and distri- bution system and make the introduction of alternative technologies,  including RE, diffi cult. An examination and modifi cation of existing  laws and regulations is a fi rst step in the introduction of RE technolo- gies, especially for integrating them into the electric power system  (Casten, 2008).  In addition to regulations that address the power generation sector,  local building codes sometimes prevent the installation of rooftop solar  panels or the introduction of wind turbines for aesthetic or historical  preservation reasons (Bronin, 2009; Kooles, 2009).  Intellectual property rights Intellectual property rights play a complex and confl icting role.  Technological development of RE has been rapid in recent years, par- ticularly in PV and wind power (Lior, 2010; see Chapters 8 and 11).  Much of the basic technology is in the public domain, which can lead  to underinvestment in the industry. Patents protect many of these new  developments thereby promoting more private investment in R&D  (Beck, 1995; Baumol and Oates, 1998). Countering this benefi t are   concerns that have been raised that patents may unduly restrict low- cost access to these new technologies by developing countries, as has  happened with many new pharmaceuticals (Barton, 2007; Ockwell et  al., 2010; Chapters 3 and 7). There are certainly circumstances where  developing country companies need patent protection for their prod- ucts as well.  Tariffs in international trade Tariff barriers (import levies) and non-trade barriers imposed by some  countries signifi cantly reduce trade in some RE technologies. Discussions  about lowering or eliminating tariffs on environmental goods and ser- vices including RE technologies have been part of the Doha round of  trade negotiations since 2001. Many developing countries argue that  reducing these tariffs would primarily benefi t developed countries  economically, and no resolution has been achieved so far. Developed  countries have levied tariffs on imported biofuels, much of which origi- nates in developing countries, thereby discouraging their wider use  (Elobeid and Tokgoz, 2008; see Section 2.4.6.2).   Allocation of government fi nancial support  Since the 1940s, governments in industrialized countries have spent  considerable amounts of public money on energy-related research,  development, and demonstration. By far the greatest proportion of  this has been on nuclear energy systems (IEA, 2008b; see also Section  10.5). However, following the fi nancial crisis of 2008 and 2009, some  governments used part of their ‘stimulus packages’ to encourage RE or  energy effi ciency (Section 9.3.1.3). Tax write-offs for private spending  have been similarly biased towards non-RE sources (e.g., in favour of  oil exploration or new coal-burning systems), notwithstanding some  recent tax incentives for RE (GAO, 2007; Lior, 2010). The policy ratio- nale for government support for developing new energy systems is  discussed in Section 1.5 and Chapter 11.  1.4.3  Issues  Issues are not readily amenable to policies and programs.  An issue is that the resource may be too small to be useful at a particular  location or for a particular purpose. For example, the wind speed may  be too low or too variable to produce reliable power, the topography  may be either too fl at or there may be insuffi cient fl ow to sustain low- head hydro or run-of-river systems for hydropower, or the demands of  industry may be too large to be supplied by a local renewable source  (Painuly, 2001).   Some renewable resources such as wind and solar are variable and  may not always be available for dispatch when needed (Chapter 8).  Furthermore, the energy density of many renewable sources is relatively  low, so that their power levels may be insuffi cient on their own for some  purposes such as very large-scale industrial facilities. Extensive planting  for biomass production or building of large-area reservoirs can lead to  displacement of forests with associated negative effects, such as the     197  Chapter 1 Renewable Energy and Climate Change  direct and indirect release of CO2 and/or methane and soil loss (Melillo  et al., 2009; Chapter 2 and Section 5.6.1).   1.5  Role of policy, research and    development, deployment, scaling up   and implementation strategies  An increasing number and variety of RE policies—motivated by a variety  of factors—have driven escalated growth in RE technologies in recent  years (Section 11.2). In addition to the reduction of CO2 emissions,  governments have enacted RE policies to meet a number of objec- tives, including the creation of local environmental and health benefi ts;  facilitation of energy access, particularly for rural areas; advancement of  energy security goals by diversifying the portfolio of energy technologies  and resources; and improving social and economic development through  potential employment opportunities. In general, energy access has been  the primary driver in developing countries whereas energy security and  environmental concerns have been most important in developed coun- tries (Chapter 9 and Section 11.3).  For policymakers wishing to support the development and deployment  of RE technologies for climate change mitigation goals, it is critical to  consider the potential of RE to reduce emissions from a lifecycle per- spective, an issue that each technology chapter addresses. For example,  while the use of biofuels can offset GHG emissions from fossil fuels,  direct and indirect land use changes must be also be evaluated in  order to determine net benefi ts.11 In some cases, this may even result  in increased GHG emissions, potentially overwhelming the gains from  CO2 absorption (Fargione et al., 2008; Scharlemann and Laurance, 2008;  Searchinger et al., 2008; Krewitt et al., 2009; Melillo et al., 2009). A full  discussion of this effect can be found in Sections 2.5.3 and 9.3.4.  Various policies have been designed to address every stage of the devel- opment chain, involving R&D, testing, deployment, commercialization,  market preparation, market penetration, maintenance and monitor- ing, as well as integration into the existing system. These policies are  designed and implemented to overcome the barriers and markets fail- ures discussed above (Sections 1.4.2, 11.1.1, 11.4 and 11.5).   Two key market failures are typically addressed: 1) the external costs of  GHG emissions are not priced at an appropriate level; and 2) deploy- ment of low-carbon technologies such as RE creates benefi ts to society  beyond those captured by the innovator, leading to under-investment  in such efforts (Sections 11.1 and 11.4). Implementing RE policies (i.e.,  those promoting exclusively RE) in addition to climate change miti- gation policies (i.e., encouraging low-carbon technologies in general)  can be justifi ed if a) the negative consequences of innovation market   failures should be mitigated and/or b) other goals beyond climate pro- tections are to be addressed.  1.5.1  Policy options: trends, experience and  assessment  The focus of RE policies is shifting from a concentration almost entirely  on electricity to include the heating/cooling and transportation sectors.  These trends are matched by increasing success in the development of  a range of RE technologies and their manufacture and implementation  (see Chapters 2 through 7), as well as by a rapid increase in annual  investment in RE and a diversifi cation of fi nancing institutions, particu- larly since 2004/2005 (Section 11.2.2).  Policy and decision makers approach the market in a variety of ways:  level the playing fi eld in terms of taxes and subsidies; create a regula- tory environment for effective utilization of the resource; internalize  externalities of all options or modify or establish prices through taxes  and subsidies; create command and control regulations; provide  government support for R&D; provide for government procurement  priorities; or establish market oriented regulations, all of which shape  the markets for new technologies. Some of these options, such as  price, modify relative consumer preferences, provide a demand pull  and enhance utilization for a particular technology. Others, such as  government-supported R&D, attempt to create new products through  supply push (Freeman and Soete, 2000; Sawin, 2001; Moore, 2002).  No globally-agreed list of RE policy options or groupings exists. For  the purpose of simplifi cation, R&D and deployment policies have been  organized within the following categories in this report (Section 11.5):  • Fiscal incentives: actors (individuals, households, companies) are  granted a reduction of their contribution to the public treasury via  income or other taxes;  • Public fi nance: public support for which a fi nancial return is expected  (loans, equity) or fi nancial liability is incurred (guarantee); and  • Regulation: rule to guide or control conduct of those to whom it   applies.  Research and development, innovation, diffusion and deployment of new  low-carbon technologies create benefi ts to society beyond those captured  by the innovator, resulting in under-investment in such efforts. Thus, gov- ernment R&D can play an important role in advancing RE technologies.  Not all countries can afford to support R&D with public funds, but in the  majority of countries where some level of support is possible, public R&D  for RE enhances the performance of nascent technologies so that they can  meet the demands of initial adopters. Public R&D also improves existing  technologies that already function in commercial environments. A full dis- cussion of R&D policy options can be found in Section 11.5.2.  11  Note that such land use changes are not restricted to biomass based RE. For  example, wind generation and hydro developments as well as surface mining for  coal and storage of combustion ash also incur land use impacts.    198  Renewable Energy and Climate Change Chapter 1  Public R&D investments are most effective when complemented by other  policy instruments, particularly RE deployment policies that simultaneously  enhance demand for new RE technologies. Together R&D and deployment  policies create a positive feedback cycle, inducing private sector investment  in R&D. Relatively early deployment policies in a technology’s development  accelerate learning through private R&D and/or through utilization and cost  reduction (Section 11.5.2).The failure of many worthy technologies to move  from R&D to commercialization has been coined the ‘valley of death’ for  new products (Markham, 2002; Murphy and Edwards, 2003; IEA, 2009b;  Section 11.5). Attempts to move renewable technology into mainstream  markets following the oil price shocks failed in most developed countries  (Roulleau and Loyd, 2008). Many of the technologies were not suffi ciently  developed or had not reached cost competitiveness and, once the price of  oil came back down, interest in implementing these technologies faded.  Solar hot water heaters were a technology that was ready for the market  and with tax incentives many such systems were installed. But once the tax  advantage was withdrawn, the market largely collapsed (Dixit and Pindyck,  1994).  Some policy elements have been shown to be more effective and effi - cient in rapidly increasing RE deployment, but there is no one-size-fi ts-all  policy, and the mix of policies and their design and implementation vary  regionally and depend on prevailing conditions. Experience shows that  different policies or combinations of policies can be more effective and  effi cient depending on factors such as the level of technological maturity,  availability of affordable capital, and the local and national RE resource  base. Key policy elements include adequate value to cover costs and  account for social benefi ts, inclusiveness and ease of administration.  Further, the details of policy design and implementation—including fl ex- ibility to adjust as technologies, markets and other factors evolve—can  be as important in determining effectiveness and effi ciency as the specifi c  policies that are used (Section 11.5). Transparent, sustained, consistent  signals—from predictability of a specifi c policy, to pricing of carbon and  other externalities, to long-term targets for RE—have been found to be  crucial for reducing the risk of investment suffi ciently to enable appro- priate rates of deployment and the evolution of low-cost applications  (Sections 11.2, 11.4 and 11.5).   For deployment policies with a focus on RE electricity, there is a wealth  of literature assessing quantity-based (quotas, renewable portfolio stan- dards that defi ne the degree to which electricity generated must be from  renewable sources, and tendering/bidding policies) and price-based  (fi xed-price and premium-price feed-in tariffs (FIT)) policies, primarily  quotas and FITs, and with a focus on effectiveness and effi ciency criteria.  Several studies have concluded that some FITs have been effective and  effi cient at promoting RE electricity, mainly due to the combination of  long-term fi xed price or premium payments, network connections, and  guaranteed purchase of all RE electricity generated. A number of studies  have concluded that ‘well-designed’ and ‘well-implemented’ FITs have  to date been the most effi cient (defi ned as comparison of total support  received and generation cost) and effective (ability to deliver an increase   in the share of RE electricity consumed) support policies for promoting  RE electricity (Ragwitz et al., 2005; Stern, 2007; de Jager and Rathmann,  2008; Section 11.5.4). Quota policies have been moderately successful in  some cases. They can be effective and effi cient if designed to reduce risk;  for example, with long-term contracts.  An increasing number of governments are adopting fi scal incentives for  RE heating and cooling. To date, fi scal incentives have been the preva- lent policy in use to support RE heating and cooling, with grants the  most commonly applied incentive. Obligations to use RE heat are gaining  attention for their potential to encourage growth independent of public  fi nancial support (Section 11.5.5).   A range of policies has been implemented to support the deployment of  RE for transport, though the vast majority of these policies and related  experiences have been specifi c to biofuels. RE fuel mandates or blending  requirements are key drivers in the development of most modern bio- fuel industries. Other policies include direct government payments or tax  reductions. Those countries with the highest share of biofuels in trans- port fuel consumption have had hybrid systems that combine mandates  (including penalties) with fi scal incentives (foremost tax exemptions).  Policies have infl uenced the development of an international biofuel  trade (Section 11.5.6).  There is now considerable experience with several types of policies  designed to increase the use of renewable technology. Denmark became  a world leader in the manufacture and deployment of large-scale wind  turbines by setting long-term contracts for renewably generated electric- ity production (REN21, 2009). Germany and Spain (among others) have  used a similar demand-pull mechanism through FITs that assured pro- ducers of RE electricity suffi ciently high rates for a long and certain time  period. Germany is the world’s leading installer of solar PV, and in 2008  had the largest installed capacity of wind turbines (REN21, 2009). The  USA has relied mostly on government subsidies for RE technologies and  this supply-push approach has been less successful than demand pull  (Lewis and Wiser, 2007; Butler and Neuhoff, 2008). China has encouraged  renewable technology for water heating, solar PV and wind turbines by  investing in these technologies directly. China is already the leading pro- ducer of solar hot water systems for both export and domestic use, and is  now the largest producer of PV technology (REN 21, 2009).  One important challenge will be fi nding a way for RE and carbon-pricing  policies to interact such that they take advantage of synergies rather  than tradeoffs (Section 11.5.7). Impacts can be positive or negative,  depending on policy choice, design and the level of implementation  (local, regional, national or global). Negative effects would include the  risk of carbon leakage and rebound effects, which need to be taken into  account when designing policies. In the long term, enhancing knowledge  for the implementers and regulators of RE supply technologies and pro- cesses can help reduce costs of mitigation, and putting a price on carbon  can increase the competitiveness of RE (Sections 11.1.1 and 11.5.7).    199  Chapter 1 Renewable Energy and Climate Change  1.5.2  Enabling environment  RE technologies can play a greater role if they are implemented in  conjunction with ‘enabling’ policies. A favourable, or ‘enabling’, envi- ronment for RE can be created by addressing the possible interactions  of a given policy with other RE policies as well as with other non-RE  policies; by understanding the ability of RE developers to obtain fi nance  and planning permission to build and site a project; by removing barriers  for access to networks and markets for RE installations and output; by  increasing education and awareness raising; and by enabling technology  transfer. In turn, existence of an ‘enabling’ environment can increase the  effi ciency and effectiveness of policies to promote RE (Section 11.6).  1.5.2.1  Complementing renewable energy policies and   non-renewable energy policies  Since all forms of RE capture and production involve spatial consider- ations, policies need to consider land use, employment, transportation,  agricultural, water, food security, trade concerns, existing infrastructure  and other sector-specifi c issues. Government policies that complement  each other are more likely to be successful, and the design of individual  RE policies will also affect the success of their coordination with other  policies. Attempting to actively promote the complementarities of poli- cies across multiple sectors—from energy to agriculture to water policy,  etc.—while also considering the independent objectives of each, is not  an easy task and may create win-lose and/or win-win situations, with  possible trade-offs.  1.5.2.2  Providing infrastructure, networks and markets for  renewable energy  Advancing RE in the electric power sector, for example, will require poli- cies to address its integration into transmission and distribution systems  both technically (Chapter 8) and institutionally (Chapter 11). The grid must  be able to handle both traditional, often more central, supply as well as  modern RE supply, which is often variable and distributed (Quezada et al.,  2006; Cossent et al., 2009) and the governance of the system may need to  be adjusted to ease or harmonize access; current regulations and laws,  designed to assure the reliability of the current centralized grid, may  prevent the wide-scale introduction of renewable electric generating  technology.  In the transport sector, issues exist related to the necessary infrastructure  for biofuels, recharging hydrogen, battery or hybrid electric vehicles that  are ‘fuelled’ by the electric grid or from off-grid renewable electrical pro- duction (Tomic and Kempton, 2007; Sections 1.4.2.4 and 11.6.5).   Brazil has been especially effective in establishing a rural agricultural  development program around sugarcane. Bioethanol produced from  sugarcane in Brazil is currently responsible for about 40% of the spark  ignition travel and it has been demonstrated for use in diesel buses and  even in a crop duster aircraft. The bagasse, which is otherwise wasted, is  gasifi ed and used to operate gas turbines for electricity production while  the ‘waste’ heat is used in the sugar to bioethanol refi ning process (Pousa  et al., 2007; Searchinger et al., 2008).   1.5.3  A structural shift  If decision makers intend to increase the share of RE and, at the same  time, to meet ambitious climate mitigation targets, then long-standing  commitments and fl exibility to learn from experience will be critical.  Some analyses conclude that large, low-carbon facilities such as nuclear  power, or large coal (and natural gas) plants with CCS can be scaled up  rapidly enough to meet CO2 reduction goals if they are available (MIT,  2003, 2007, 2009). Alternatively, the expansion of natural gas-fi red tur- bines during the past few decades in North America and Europe, and  the rapid growth in wind and solar technologies for electric power gen- eration (see Figure 1.12) demonstrate that modularity and more widely  distributed smaller-scale units can also scale rapidly to meet large-scale  energy demands. The technological and economic potential for each of  these approaches and their costs have important implications for the  scale and role of RE in addressing climate change (Pilavachi, 2002; MIT,  2003, 2007, 2009; Onovwiona and Ugursal, 2006). To achieve GHG  concentration stabilization levels that incorporate high shares of RE,  a structural shift in today’s energy systems will be required over the  next few decades. Such a transition to low-carbon energy differs from  previous ones (e.g., from wood to coal, or coal to oil) because the  available time span is restricted to a few decades, and because RE  must develop and integrate into a system constructed in the context  of an existing energy structure that is very different from what might  be required under higher penetration RE futures (Section 11.7 and  Chapter 10).  A structural shift towards a world energy system that is mainly based  on renewable energy might begin with a prominent role for energy  effi ciency in combination with RE; policies that extend beyond R&D  to support technology deployment; the creation of an enabling envi- ronment that includes education and awareness raising; and the  systematic development of integrative policies with broader sectors,  including agriculture, transportation, water management and urban  planning (Sections 11.6 and 11.7). The appropriate and reliable mix  of instruments is even more important where energy infrastructure is  not yet developed and energy demand is expected to increase signifi - cantly in the future (Section 11.7).    200  Renewable Energy and Climate Change Chapter 1  References  Ahman, M., and L.J.

Notes:   1 Technical potentials reported here represent total worldwide potentials for annual RE supply and do not deduct any potential that is already being utilized for energy production. In  2008, total primary energy supply from RE sources on a direct equivalent basis equalled: bioenergy (50.33 EJ); hydropower (11.55 EJ); wind (0.79 EJ); solar (0.50 EJ); geothermal  (0.41 EJ); and ocean (0.002 EJ). According to the defi nition of technical potential in the Glossary (see Annex I), many of the studies summarized here take into some account  broader economic and socio-political considerations. For example, for some technologies, land suitability or other sustainability factors are included, which result in lower technical  potential estimates.    2 Technical potential estimates for 2020, 2030 and 2050 are based on a review of studies in Krewitt et al. (2009). Due to differences in methodologies and accounting methods   between studies, comparison of these estimates across technologies and regions, as well as to primary energy demand, should be exercised with caution. Data presented in  Chapters 2 through 7 may disagree with these fi gures due to differing methodologies. Krewitt et al. (2009), as well as many of the other studies reported in the table, assume  that technical potential increases over time due, in part, to technological advancements.   Appendix to Chapter 1  Continued next Page      207  Chapter 1 Renewable Energy and Climate Change  3 Range of estimates derives from studies presented in Chapters 2 through 7 (occasionally including some of the studies reported in the Krewitt et al. (2009) review). As a result,  ranges do not always encompass the fi gures presented in Krewitt et al. (2009). Ranges are based on various methods and apply to different future years; consequently, as with  Krewitt et al. (2009), the resulting ranges are not strictly comparable across technologies.   4 Estimates for PV and CSP in Krewitt et al. (2009) are based on different data and methodologies, which tend to signifi cantly understate the technical potential for PV relative to  CSP. In part as a result, a range for total solar energy technical potential is provided in the primary energy category based on Rogner et al. (2000). Note that this technical potential  for total solar primary energy is not the sum of the three listed technologies (PV, CSP and solar heat) due to different studies used. Also note that the technical potentials for PV,  CSP and solar heat listed in the table are not strictly additive due to possible competition for land among specifi c solar technologies.  5 Estimates for geothermal electricity in Krewitt et al. (2009) appear to largely consider only hydrothermal resources. The range of estimates presented in Chapter 4 derives from  EPRI (1978), Rowley (1982), Stefansson (2005), and Tester et al. (2005, 2006) and includes both hydrothermal and EGS potential.  6 The absolute range of technical potential for ocean energy is highly uncertain, because few technical potential estimates have been conducted due to the fact that the technologies  are still largely in the R&D phase and have not been commercially deployed at scale.  7 Estimates for offshore wind energy in Krewitt et al. (2009) and the range of estimates provided in the literature as presented in the table are both based on relatively shallow water  and near-shore applications. Greater technical potential for offshore wind energy is found when considering deeper-water applications that might rely on fl oating wind turbine  designs.  8 The technical potential for total solar primary energy is not the sum of the three listed technologies (PV, CSP and solar heat) due to different studies used; also note that possible  competition for land among specifi c solar technologies makes it inappropriate to add the technical potential estimates for PV, CSP and solar heat to derive a total solar technical  potential. The estimates of the total solar energy technical potential provided in the table do not differentiate between the different solar conversion technologies, but just take  into account average conversion effi ciency, available land area and meteorological conditions. At certain geographical locations all listed solar technologies could be used and  users will decide what service they need from which technology.  9 Primary energy from biomass (in direct equivalent terms) could be used to meet electricity, thermal or transportation needs, all with a conversion loss from primary energy ranging  from roughly 20 to 80%. As a result, comparisons of the technical potential for biomass in primary energy terms to the technical potentials of other RE sources in delivering  secondary energy supply (i.e., electric power and heat) should be made with care.  10 The conditions under the low technical potential estimate could emerge when agricultural productivity increases stall worldwide combined with high food demand and no surplus  land for energy crops being available. It is also assumed that marginal and degraded lands are not utilized and a large fraction of biomass residue fl ows is assumed to be used as  feedstock in other sectors rather than for bioenergy. However, low-grade residues, dung and municipal waste will in such a situation likely still remain available for bioenergy.  11 The higher end of the biomass potential is conditional and assumes proper land management and substantial increases in agricultural yields and intensifi ed forestry management.  Achieving such a potential will be sustainable only if monitoring and good governance of land use is effective, and sustainability frameworks are in place.    208  View publication statsView publication stats  https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263353791
