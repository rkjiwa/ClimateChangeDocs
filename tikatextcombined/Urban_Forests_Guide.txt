These changes   put more people, property and   ecosystems at risk.”    - Black et al.2   This guide has been prepared to help communities in British  Columbia (B.C.) identify and prepare for some of the impacts  of climate change. It provides information on how you can  use urban forests to manage some of the impacts of changing  climates, and how to adapt these urban forests so that they  survive and thrive in future climates.   This is a high-level overview that can be used by staff and  elected officials in B.C.’s communities—small and large, rural and  urban—including those who do not have professional arborists  or urban foresters on staff.

While natural causes have played a role,  most of the atmospheric warming observed over the last 50  years is attributed to burning of fossil fuels, land clearing, and  other human activities that have increased the concentrations of  greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This has already changed  climates in British Columbia and around the world, and scientists  warn that further climate change is unavoidable.1  1    2 Urban Forests: A Climate Adaptation Guide  3  Climate change is not just about changes in  temperature. The warming of the atmosphere  leads to long-term changes in rain and snowfall  patterns, wind and ocean currents, ice and snow  accumulation, and other aspects of climate. It can  increase the frequency of droughts, heat waves,  heavy rainfall and snowfall, and other extreme  weather events. These changes affect fisheries,  forests and rangelands, and the jobs that  depend on those resources. They increase the  risk of damage to infrastructure from increased  flooding, landslides, melting permafrost, and  coastal storm surges, but also the risk of water  shortages. Such impacts will increasingly  challenge the capacity of government, business,  and community leaders to protect public safety,  manage natural resources, and promote social  and economic sustainability.  Climate Change Adaption  Much emphasis has been placed on ways to  mitigate climate change by reducing use of fossil  fuels and cutting greenhouse gas emissions.  This remains of great importance. However, even  if all greenhouse gas emissions were to stop  tomorrow, the excess greenhouse gases already  in the atmosphere would continue to affect  climate for the next 30–40 years. In addition to  reducing emissions, communities need to adapt  to climate change impacts—to prepare for a  different future. ‘Business as usual’ is no longer an  option.   Adaptation to climate change means making  adjustments to minimize adverse effects and   maximize opportunities. It is sometimes also  described as an ongoing process that involves:   •  Assessment to identify relevant climate  changes and impacts, vulnerabilities, and  priorities for action;   •  Implementation of these plans; and  •  Monitoring results and updating plan(s) as   new information becomes available.   Urban forests are an invaluable part of  communities across British Columbia, yet they  are often under-recognized and under-valued.  For this reason, the Union of British Columbia  Municipalities and Ministry of Community, Sport  and Cultural Development prepared Planting  our Future: A Tree Toolkit for Communities.  The toolkit helps communities—small and  large, rural and urban—to maximize the  values from their urban forests and to address  challenges that they are facing. This urban  forest adaptation guide is a companion piece to  Planting our Future.   Planting our Future  includes information  on the values of  urban forests, issues  and challenges, and  tools and strategies to  achieve a healthy and  sustainable urban forest.  It is available from   http://www.treesfortomorrow.gov.bc.ca/.    3 Introduction    Mitigation refers to actions that reduce human- caused greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions into  the atmosphere.   Adaptation refers to actions that better prepare  communities and businesses for climate change  and its impacts. Adaptation actions typically  reduce risks and increase opportunities related  to climate change.   Sequestration refers to the removal of  carbon from the atmosphere. Trees and other  vegetation sequester carbon as they grow,  storing it in their trunks, roots, branches, and  leaves.  The communities that take proactive steps to  adapt to climate change will be better prepared  for its impacts. The attention, time and money  invested will produce valuable returns in terms  of cost savings (e.g., related to energy, fire  suppression or storm-clean up) and improved  economic performance (e.g., through enhanced  livability, business and staff recruitment, tourism,  and property values). Done well, steps to adapt  to climate change could protect human life  and property, avoid or reduce future costs, and  exploit new opportunities related to changes in   “Integrating climate change adaptation   into decision-making is an opportunity to   enhance resilience and reduce the    long-term costs and impacts of climate   change.”  - Natural Resources Canada3  local climate—making lemonade from climate  change lemons!   Urban Forests and Climate Change  Adaptation    While there are many benefits to be derived  from urban forests (see Planting our Future),  this document focuses only on those related to  climate change adaptation. Equally, there are  many ways to adapt communities to climate  change, but this document focuses only the  ‘tree-centric’ approaches (Figure 1). However,  this guide is linked to much wider thinking  about climate change adaptation, including  broader impacts on land use, infrastructure, and  utilities planning.   Section 2 of this guide provides an overview  of some of the impacts of climate change on  communities and urban forests, such as more  frequent heat waves and intense precipitation  events. Section 3 outlines ways that urban  forests can help to manage these impacts, for  example by providing shade and detaining  stormwater. Section 4 recognizes that urban  forests themselves will be under stress from new  climatic conditions and new pests and diseases,  and looks at ways to manage urban forests so  that they survive and thrive in future climates.      4 Urban Forests: A Climate Adaptation Guide  5  Provincial Climate Action Initiatives   The Province is undertaking a variety of initiatives to mitigate and adapt to climate change. These include  the following.   •  The Greenhouse Gas Reduction Targets Act (2007) set legislated targets of provincial emissions  reductions of 33% below 2007 levels by 2020 and 80% below 2007 levels by 2050.   •  The B.C. Climate Action Plan (2008) outlines strategies and initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas  emissions.   •  More than 179 local governments have signed the Climate Action Charter, committing to carbon  neutrality by 2012.   •  The Climate Action Toolkit is a website providing information and cases studies of local government  initiatives towards climate action.   •   Preparing for Climate Change: British Columbia’s Adaptation Strategy (2009) outlines government’s  approach to adaptation, builds on the Province’s past accomplishments, and provides a framework for  future climate change adaptation initiatives.   •  The B.C. Regional Adaptation Collaborative aims to advance adaptation decision-making in British  Columbia. One of its programs is developing tools and adaptation plans for communities.   •  The Ministry of Forests, Mines and Lands established a Climate Change Task Team to review potential  impacts of climate change on provincial forest and range resources and identify knowledge gaps,  with recommendations provided in Preparing for Climate Change: Adapting to Impacts on British  Columbia’s Forest and Range Resources   •  The Future Forest Ecosystems Initiative focuses on adapting B.C.’s forest and range management  framework so that it continues to maintain and enhance the resilience and productivity of B.C.’s  ecosystems as the climate changes.   •  The Zero Net Deforestation Act encourages an equal area of trees be planted for carbon storage  to offset any forest land that is permanently cleared for another use.   •  The Community Energy and Emission Inventory is tracking land use change at the Regional  District level, including an estimate of deforestation and the resulting CO2 emissions.  More information and links to these provincial initiatives can be found at http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/cas/ resources/reports.html and http://www.toolkit.bc.ca.     5 Introduction    “Urban forests” are the total collection of  trees and their growing environments found  within our communities and their surrounding  areas, from villages to city centres. They include  the treed environments on both public and  privately owned lands—in parks and backyards,  along paths and boulevards, and other ‘green’  areas. They include cultivated landscapes,  natural areas and, in some communities, local  ‘working’ or managed forests. Although they are  referred to as ‘urban’ forests, this term applies  equally to small and rural communities.   “Urban forestry” is the deliberate management  of these treed environments to provide a wide  array of economic, environmental and social  services to communities. Urban forests can  be a key asset in supporting more liveable,  healthy, sustainable and economically vibrant  communities.   Figure 1: Climate adaptation and urban forests    6 Urban Forests: A Climate Adaptation Guide  7  Climate Change   and Your  Comunuity  Future climates and related impacts will vary from place to place,  but all communities in B.C. will be affected in some way. This  guide does not provide detailed information about future climate  predictions for specific regions in B.C., but that information is  available from the Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium4  (PCIC).  A good place to start is the PCIC Plan2Adapt website,  which  includes information on predicted impacts by regional district.  PCIC can also provide information tailored to your community.  Projected climate changes for British Columbia as a whole, and  some of the ongoing and expected impacts, are described below.  Climate Change in B.C.  Places in the northern latitudes—such as British Columbia— are expected to experience greater warming than the global  average. Climate scientists expect that all parts of the province  will be warmer, especially in the winter, with the greatest  increase in northern B.C. (Figure 2). Winters will likely be wetter  throughout the province, with smaller snow packs and earlier  snowmelts. Southern and central B.C. are expected to get drier  summers, while the northern B.C. summers are likely to be wetter  (Figure 3).6  Changes will vary by region and by altitude.   2   From Impacts to  Adaptation: Canada in  a Changing   Climate 2007 (Natural  Resources Canada, 2007)  includes a discussion of  expected climate change  impacts and case studies  of responses.    7 Climate Change and Your Community  Figure 2: Actual and projected temperature change, B.C. 1961-2080  Source: Spittlehouse, 2008.

Mean annual precipitation 1961-1990, projected using the A2 emissions scenario for 2020,   2050 and 2080    9 Climate Change and Your Community  Climate and Weather   The weather varies from place to place, from year to year and even from decade to decade, subject to  natural cycles such as the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). For example, in 100 Mile House, an El Niño  winter can mean winter temperatures 4–6°C warmer with 10–15% less precipitation, while a La Niña winter  makes it 1–2°C cooler than average with 10–15% more precipitation.7  This is further complicated by a longer  term natural cycle, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which can further affect annual and seasonal temperature  and rainfall.   Climate is measured based on long-term averages of weather in many different places and environments.  Climate is always changing, even without human influence, as evidenced by past ice ages. However,  emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere are creating significant global climate warming that is  superimposed on the ‘natural’ rate of change. Moreover this anthropogenic (or humanly-modified) warming,  and the changes associated with it, is occurring very quickly. The long-term trend of global climate warming  can be clearly seen, even though the weather will continue to vary from one place and time to another.   The climate projections shown in both figures  are based on the assumption that global  greenhouse gas emissions will continue to  increase during the decades to come, and that  climate will therefore change more rapidly than  in the past. These maps represent only one of a  range of possible futures for British Columbia;  while scientists can tell us a lot about what is  likely to happen, there is still uncertainty in these  projections.   One of the challenges of adaptation is to identify  strategies that are robust across the full range of  possible futures.   Changes to Forested Ecosystems   Future forests will be different from those of   today. The climate ‘envelopes’ suitable for many  tree species currently found in B.C. are moving  north and to higher elevations. With even a  1°C increase in mean annual temperature,  ecosystems are expected to shift up to 150 km  northwards and 300 m higher. These changes  will have profound impacts not only on the  trees, but on the associated plants, animals and  ecosystem processes (e.g., pollination systems)  that rely on B.C.’s forests. Many species of plants  and animals will likely become endangered or  perhaps even extinct.  B.C.’s conifer species in particular are expected  to lose much of their climatically suitable  habitat.8  A study of future forest ecosystems in  B.C. predicts that in the 21st century, climatic  suitability for spruce and Douglas-fir forests will     10 Urban Forests: A Climate Adaptation Guide  11  Table 1 identifies some of the climate changes that have already occurred, and shows projections for the  next 40 years together with some of the related impacts.

Local trends and  projections, especially in mountainous areas may be different    11 Climate Change and Your Community  decrease in southern interior valleys and increase  at higher elevations and latitudes, with a more  substantial decrease for spruce. Figure 4 shows  how the climate envelope suitable for spruce is  expected to change over the next 70 years, and  Figure 5 shows the same for Douglas-fir trees.   Natural tree migration may no longer occur fast  enough to keep the landscape forested. Tree  species can naturally migrate at about 100 m  per year—but would need to migrate several  thousand metres per year in order to keep pace  with expected climate change.  On a more positive note, trees currently growing  at the northern edge of their distribution, such as  Garry oaks, arbutus or coast redwood, may thrive  as more regions and new sites may become  suitable for these species. Another potentially  positive effect of climate change (for trees) is that  with more carbon in the atmosphere, tree growth  rates may increase in some areas as long as other  supporting factors, such as soil moisture, remain  available. Also, a lengthened growing season  in higher latitudes and elevations is leading to  increased tree growth rates and accelerated  maturation processes—both positive for the rate  of carbon sequestration.   Mountain pine beetles are indigenous to pine  forests in B.C., but population numbers were kept  in check by periods of low temperatures. Another  contributing factor to the mountain pine beetle  epidemic is the abundance of hosts, like old  pine, that are stressed by changes such as longer  periods of drought. With warming winters and   longer periods of drought, beetle populations  have exploded and killed trees on more than  16.3 million hectares in the province. Similar  warming and variable winter conditions may also  allow the Douglas-fir beetle and spruce beetle to  flourish. Other insects such as spruce bud worm  and tussock moth are also expected to become  more prolific. The risk of outbreaks of western  spruce budworm (which attacks Douglas-fir)  and spruce bark beetle is projected to decrease  in southern and central interior valleys as these  trees become less prevalent, and increase in  north-western B.C. In addition, tree diseases  caused by fungi and bacteria are becoming more  prevalent, and expected to get worse as trees  already stressed by changes in local climate are  more susceptible to pathogens.9      The 2006 windstorms in southern B.C. were the  most destructive storm event for hydro and  phone infrastructure in the Province’s history,  with huge costs to industry and communities.   Extreme events recorded by B.C.’s Provincial  Emergency Program (PEP) from 2003–2005 cost  an average of $86 million per year, compared to  $10 million per year from 1999–2002.10    12 Urban Forests: A Climate Adaptation Guide  13  Figure 4: Change in climate suitable for spruce from present day–2080  Figure 5: Change in climate suitable for Douglas-fir from present day–2080    13 Climate Change and Your Community  Impacts to Communities   Extreme Weather Events  Climate change is bringing more frequent  extreme weather events that can occur earlier or  later than ‘normal’, and last longer. This includes  wind-, rain- and snow-storms, prolonged  droughts, and heat waves. Extreme weather and  related impacts such as landslides create major  challenges for communities, including the cost of  replacing damaged property and infrastructure.   Floods and Drought The impacts of climate change on water will  vary by region. In watersheds with winter snow,  warmer temperatures will speed up spring  melt, increase spring flooding, and reduce the  flow and availability of water in summer. In  watersheds where precipitation falls mainly as  rain, more intense winter rains will increase the  risk of downstream flooding. For many interior  watersheds, tree cover loss associated with  climate change and the mountain pine beetle  epidemic will increase runoff and flooding.  More prolonged summer droughts will change  community water supplies. Climate change and  its impacts on water flow will also affect drinking  water quality, municipal infrastructure, public  safety, aquatic and riparian habitats, hydro  generation and other water-related values, and  exacerbate conflicts between water users.   Wildfire  In many regions of B.C., warmer temperatures  in late spring and early fall, less summer  precipitation, and more frequent periods of   drought mean a longer fire season and increased  risk of a catastrophic forest fire. In parts of the  Interior that support large areas of beetle-killed  trees, and in areas where past fire suppression  has increased fuel loads, the risk is even higher.  Sea Level Rise  Sea levels are expected to rise along many parts  of the B.C. coast. Depending on location, sea  level on some parts of the coast is expected  to rise by up to one metre by the end of the  century (others will experience a much lower  increase).12  The effects of sea level rise will be  compounded by greater storm surges and may  cause significant erosion to coastal shorelines.   Figure 6: Wildfire  The Insurance Bureau of Canada identified the  2003 Kelowna firestorm as the single largest  Canadian insurance loss for a wildfire at $250  million. 11    14 Urban Forests: A Climate Adaptation Guide  15  For more information on regional implications  for sea level see Projected Sea Level Changes  for British Columbia in the 21st Century.13  Health Impacts  Climate change has health implications.   Heat waves cause a variety of mild to severe  symptoms linked with heat-related illnesses,  including thirst, dizziness, confusion, weakness  and fainting/collapsing.15  Smog (ground-level  ozone) also worsens during heat waves, causing  problems for people with heart or respiratory  problems. Wildfires, which are more frequent  with drought conditions, also create air quality  problems and related health advisories.   More intense rain and flooding can cause  turbidity and water quality issues for drinking  water supplies.   New forest pests and diseases are able to  migrate and survive with the warming climate.  Cryptococcus gatti, a tropical fungus, first  appeared in 1999 on the south east coast of  Vancouver Island, likely due to changing climatic  conditions. This fungus has caused more than   100 cases of human illness and appears to be  spreading from Vancouver Island to the Lower  Mainland.16   Social and Economic Impacts  There will be numerous social and economic  impacts associated with climate change;  however these are not discussed in this  document. Forestry and forest product industries  will be greatly affected by these changes,  including dramatic fluctuations in timber  supply, with high harvest levels following major  insect epidemics to reduced supplies as those  forests grow back under more drought-stressed  conditions.  On the positive side, some communities are  finding creative ways to use beetle-killed wood.   Impacts to Urban Forests  Climate change is already being noticed within  urban forests. Tree species that were well suited  to the climates in which they were planted—say  20 or 50 years ago—can become ‘maladapted’  (no longer well suited)12 to changed temperature     A study of street trees in the City of   Victoria found that more than half of the  Prunus (cherry and plum) species were  in “fair to dead” condition, likely due to  summer moisture deficit, and that projected  drought conditions for 2050 and 2080  would have a devastating effect on street  trees.22  Network Rail in the UK is spending £750,000  to identify safety threats related to sea level  rise and increased storm surges. However, they  estimate that it will save the industry over £1  billion over the next 30 years by improving  safety and preventing emergencies.14     15 Climate Change and Your Community    “We have seen a lot of symptoms of drought in recent years, e.g., native Douglas-fir mortality as well as  drought symptoms on urban trees.” (City of Kelowna)19    “Loss of western red-cedar and grand fir in areas where they were on the edge of their ecological niche…  We have also seen a significant increase in the number of new invasive species.” (District of Saanich)20   “…the boreal forest, predominant in the Burns Lake region, is expected to undergo an extensive reduction  in size, as grasslands and temperate deciduous species may invade from the south, and northern expansion  is limited by poor soils and insufficient sunshine amounts. Forest fires and pest infestations are expected to  increase in frequency, area, and intensity due to warmer and drier conditions.” (Village of Burns Lake)21  Graduate students at the University of Northern B.C. have created a product called “Beetlecrete”. It  combines flakes of blue beetle-killed wood with Portland cement to form a marbled material with the  strength of concrete, but the look and feel of wood.   The massive ceiling (200 ha) of the Richmond Oval, built for the 2010 Winter Olympics, is made of salvaged  beetle-killed wood from interior B.C. forests.18  The B.C. Forestry Climate Change Working Group is working with the forest industry to explore options to  use beetle-killed wood to generate bio-fuels.     16 Urban Forests: A Climate Adaptation Guide  17  Figure 7: Flooding can cause erosion along streambanks  On December 15, 2006, the biggest windstorm  in more than forty years roared through  Vancouver, causing significant damage to  Stanley Park. This was followed by two major  windstorms in January 2007. As a result of the  storms, approximately 10,000 trees fell (5–10%  of all trees in the park) and there was severe  damage to about 40 hectares of the forest.  A bibliography of tree–wind literature is  available from www.treelink.org.24  and precipitation conditions on a site. This  creates stress on individual trees, and reduces  the geographic range or extent of the species as  trees growing in vulnerable locations succumb to  drought, pests or disease. Some species will be  better at adjusting than others.  Extreme weather events affect urban forests.  Climate change could result in more frequent  extreme windstorm events, with more trees  blown over and large branches broken.  Homeowners often remove tall trees from  their property for fear of wind damage. Major  snowstorms are also causing trees to lose limbs  to heavy snow.  Flooding can cause erosion of soils along  streambanks, undermining trees and their roots.  Flooding is projected to become both more  intense and more frequent as a result of climate  change, inhibiting the early-successional riparian  regrowth that occurs on islands and low areas  susceptible to inundation. Lowland riparian  woodlands, stream health and fisheries will suffer  as a result.  A Role for Urban Forests  All of these climate change effects impact  people, ecosystems, economic well-being,  and quality of life. Sections 3 and 4 of this  guide provide some suggestions on ways that  communities can use urban forests to adjust to  the new climate reality, and manage their urban  forests so they survive and thrive in new climate  conditions.     17  Adapting   Communities to   Future Climates  3 Many communities—from electoral areas to villages and  cities—are thinking about how climate change will affect them  and are taking steps to prepare and adapt. This section provides  information on how communities can use urban forests as a tool  for climate change adaption.   Urban forests can help communities to adapt to climate change  in ways that enhance their residents’ quality of life and mitigate  or solve anticipated problems. For example, planting large- canopy trees in parking lots provides welcome shade that makes  summer parking more pleasant. It also reduces air pollution, as  the leaves absorb airborne particulates and the shade reduces  toxic off-gassing from hot car engines. As well, asphalt lasts  longer in shaded areas. These same trees can be part of the  site’s rainwater management system, while enhancing the  visual appeal of the built environment. And all of these benefits  enhance the experience of visitors using this facility to access  nearby services and businesses, and supports business activity.25  Planning for multiple benefits such as this is part of good urban  forest management.   Below are some suggestions on ways to use urban forests to  adapt to various impacts from climate change. However, there   “Adapting for    climate change   often brings with   it surprising extra   economic, social   and other    environmental    benefits.”  UK Commission for Architecture and   the Built Environment, 2008  “Integrating climate change   and sea-level rise into    infrastructure planning    improves risk and life-cycle   cost management, and will    reduce the vulnerability of   B.C.’s critical infrastructure.”   Natural Resources Canada, 2007    18 Urban Forests: A Climate Adaptation Guide  19  is no ‘one-size-fits-all’ solution, and decisions  must be based on local circumstance, impacts,  vulnerabilities, political and socio-economic  priorities, and good baseline information.26  Warmer Summers    Climate change will mean longer, warmer  summers for many B.C. communities, and some   will experience more heat waves. Strategically- placed shade trees can dramatically reduce  summer heat and UV radiation.  Reduce the Heat Island Effect  Larger communities will feel a more pronounced  ‘heat island’ effect with built-up areas that are  hotter than nearby rural areas. (A large city  can be 1–3°C warmer than its surroundings, or  as much as 12°C hotter in the evening.) Heat  islands can increase summertime peak energy  demand, air conditioning costs, air pollution  and greenhouse gas emissions, and heat-related  illness and mortality.  •  Place groves of large-leaved trees and  shrubs upwind of heat island areas. The  evapo-transpiration from the vegetation  will create cooler, moister air that blows  into the ‘hot spots’.    •  Plant and maintain green roofs and green  walls, which help to cool the air through  evapo-transpiration of plants.     Selecting the ‘Right’ Species This document makes reference to tree species  that could be considered for specific purposes.  However, the choice of the best species for the  site (sometimes referred to as “right tree right  place”) will vary depending on local climatic  conditions (current and future), site conditions  (e.g., slope, aspect, soils, available rooting space)  and local preferences (e.g., low-maintenance  variety, flowering). For more information on  species selection, see page 37).   Figure 8: Trees in a parking lot    Evapo-transpiration is a term used to describe  the evaporation and plant transpiration from  the Earth’s land surface to the atmosphere.  Evaporation accounts for the movement of  water to the air from sources such as the soil  and canopy interception. Transpiration accounts  for the movement of water within a plant and  the subsequent loss of water as vapour through  stomata (pores) in its leaves.27     19 Adapting Communities to Future Climates  The City of Kelowna planted trees to provide  shade in the Mission Recreation Park, especially  in parking areas. Trees were selected to be heat  and drought tolerant, and pest resistant. The  trees have interpretive signs to educate the  public about the species chosen.   The District of Saanich has a Significant Trees  bylaw that protects heritage trees. If a large  shade tree is designated as a ‘significant tree’,  the homeowner can apply for a grant to be  reimbursed for up to 50% of the cost of tree  work that is considered beneficial to the tree.   Increase Shade over Pavement  Large shade trees can reduce local ambient  temperatures by 2–4°C.   •  Shade large areas of asphalt, such as  parking lots. As noted above, this also  reduces air pollution and provides a more  pleasant environment for parking. Studies  found that cars parked in parking lots with  50% canopy cover emit 8% less pollution  (from the evaporation of volatile organic  compounds) than cars in parking lots with  only 8% canopy cover.28  •  Shade streets and sidewalks. Trees help to  reduce street repaving costs as shading  helps to increase the life span of asphalt.  When asphalt paving becomes too hot, its  oil binder volatizes and leaves the stone  aggregate unprotected, so that vehicle use   loosens the aggregate and grinds down the  pavement. One study found repaving could  be deferred by 10 years on a well-shaded  street and perhaps 25 years on a very  heavily-shaded street, reducing repaving  costs by 58% over a 30-year period. Larger  trees provided greater benefits—shade  from small trees reduced costs by only  17%.29      Create Comfortable Outdoor Spaces Green spaces with a generous planting of trees  can contribute to cooler, cleaner air.  •  Plant large shade trees in public spaces.  With hotter summers and concern about  skin cancer, more people are seeking out  shaded areas to sit or walk in. Clusters or  groves of trees, preferably with multiple  canopy layers, amplify these benefits.   •  Plan for successive plantings that produce  a diversity of hardy species, age classes and  growth rates, to ensure continuous canopy  cover over time.   Figure 9: Solar friendly trees for southern exposure    20 Urban Forests: A Climate Adaptation Guide  21  Provide Shade for Buildings  Large deciduous trees have particular value in  cooling air and shading buildings in summer.  Shade trees planted on the west and south sides  of a home can reduce cooling needs (and costs)  by 25–40% and reduce peak energy demand  by up to 30%. Reducing energy use is also  important for climate mitigation.   •  Plant trees on the west side of buildings for  maximum shade benefit, as this reduces  solar gain from the warm afternoon sun.   •  Plant solar-friendly trees to the south-east  or south-west of buildings, i.e., trees that  allow heat from the low winter sun to enter  the building, while blocking high-angle  summer rays (Figure 9). Solar-friendly trees  have more diffuse canopies that allow light  to penetrate while still providing shade.  Good candidates may include some oaks,  most ash species, black or honey locust,  ginko, Lombardy poplar, Douglas-fir, or  large pine species.  •  Locate south-side shade trees about 3–7 m   Increased Precipitation   Many B.C. communities will experience greater  winter precipitation, including more intense  rainstorms. Flooding is expected to become  more frequent in some areas, with higher flood  levels.   Trees and shrubs can be part of a community’s  rainwater management system, helping to  manage or avoid stormwater flows in three ways.  First, the tree canopy intercepts rainfall, directing  some of it down the trunk and into the ground,  and returning some to the air through evapo- transpiration. (The amount of interception will  depend on the tree species, shape, size, and leaf  area density.) Second, the tree roots detain some  of the rainwater in the ground (reducing peak   from the building. As the tree grows taller,  prune the lower branches to allow more  winter sun to reach the windows (if this  will not weaken the tree structure). Avoid  placing trees too close to the building  foundation to avoid damage from roots or  problems with branches against the roof or  walls.   •  Plant deciduous trees on the east side of  buildings to provide morning sun for heat  in the winter, but shade in the summer.  •  Shade air conditioning units, as this allows  the unit to run more efficiently.   •  Ensure that trees are selected or placed so  that they do not block solar installations  (e.g., solar panels for hot water heating).   Fort Collins, USA’s Forestry Division justifies  its large annual budget of almost one million  dollars by calculating the economic benefit  produced by their trees (net annual benefits  total $1.17 million). Their “Save our Shade”  program helps residents to protect existing trees  and plant drought-resistant trees to address  water shortages in their arid climate.30    21 Adapting Communities to Future Climates  transpiration or enters and moves through  the ground as interflow. The rest recharges  groundwater aquifers, and less than 1% becomes  overland runoff. As urbanization occurs and  there are more impervious surfaces and fewer  trees, much more goes to overland runoff.  Planting significant numbers of trees and shrubs,  particularly in clusters or groves, can help to  reverse these effects.   Increase the Canopy Cover  Increasing canopy cover (leaf area) allows for  greatest interception of rainfall. Large mature  trees provide the greatest benefit, since they  have the most surface area to retain water.  •  Plant and retain large-canopy trees. The  amount of rainwater a tree detains depends  largely on its size. Large, broad-leafed or  coniferous trees intercept far more water  than smaller ornamental species.   •  Consider using more coniferous tree  species, where appropriate. Unlike   Chiswick Business Park in London, England  includes a large area of open spaces that  is designed to help regulate outdoor  temperatures. It is designed to be comfortable  for users now and as the climate changes  over the next 40–60 years. This sets it apart  from competing business parks that will  be “unpleasant places to work in without  significant air conditioning”. 31   Figure 10: Water balance before and after suburban development  flows). The exposed soil directly surrounding a  tree (or root zone) has a higher infiltration rate  than compacted soil, because roots loosen the  soil and increase water penetration. Third, the  root systems deeply penetrate the soils, allowing  for more groundwater infiltration. This means  that there will be more groundwater available to  supply streams during summer drought periods. Figure 10 shows how under natural forested  conditions, about 90% of the rainfall is either  returned to the atmosphere via evapo-  Source: Stormwater Planning: A Guidebook for British Columbia    22 Urban Forests: A Climate Adaptation Guide  23  A study of the heat island effect in the City of Toronto found that residents could save about $11 million per  year in energy costs. Savings from cool roofs (green roofs) are about 20%, shade trees 30%, wind shielding of  trees 37%, and ambient cooling by trees and reflective surfaces 12%.32  Studies in the U.S. found that three mature trees around energy-efficient homes can reduce a typical home’s  heating demand by 25–43% and peak cooling demand by 12–23%.33  Figure 11: Structural soils  This system both serves as a parking lot and as a stormwater   management facility. In addition to this double use of space, the   structural soils also provide vastly greater soil volumes for tree root   growth than traditional parking lot construction. Note: Gravel base   course is optional, since the structural soil is designed to be as strong as   the base. Figure by Sarah Dickinson    23 Adapting Communities to Future Climates  deciduous trees, which are leafless during  the rainy season, evergreen conifers  continue to detain large amounts of  rainwater throughout the year. Native or  zonally-adapted conifers (like Douglas  fir, most pines and many spruce species)  are also well-adapted to cope with  dry summers, as they do most of their  photosynthesis in the moister shoulder  seasons.   •  On sites that are moist throughout  the growing season, consider planting  anaerobically tolerant trees,34 [such as  many poplar and willow species and some  deciduous conifers, such as Swamp cypress  or Dawn redwood, as they will take up and  transpire large amounts of water.   •  Replace trees with sparse canopies. Trees  need large, full canopies with healthy leaves  to provide optimum shade and cooling  through evapo-transpiration.   Make it Easy for Water to Seep into the  Ground  As communities grow, trees are removed to  make way for impervious surfaces such as  parking lots, roads and buildings (see Figure  10). Constructed stormwater facilities (which   The City of Kelowna has a “Neighbourwoods”  program to fund tree planting on private  property. In April 2010, residents bought 450  trees at a discount ($30 per tree) to celebrate  Earth Day.35    are expensive to build and maintain) are built to  compensate for the loss of natural infiltration.  The cost has been calculated to be in excess of  $100 billion nationally.36    As well, even open ground in urbanized areas  is commonly disturbed or compacted, limiting  normal soil hydrologic functions. Tree roots  that penetrate typically impermeable urban soil  layers can increase rainwater infiltration rates.   •  Plant more trees and shrubs! Root growth  improves the both the hydrological and  biological function of urban soils and  increases rainwater infiltration rates.   •  Use mulches and native groundcovers, or  permeable paving stones layered on a sand  base, to keep the ground absorbent.   •  Have deep soils (at least 15 cm) for planting.  Better yet, keep lawn size to a minimum and  use native groundcovers where practical.  •  Provide loose, uncompacted soils as these  are important for healthy tree growth. Use  of ‘structural soils’ or ‘soil cells’ are options  to avoid soil compaction (Figure 11 and  Figure 12). Structural soils are made up  of a compacted matrix of angular stone,  with uncompacted mineral soils in the  spaces within. This meets the structural  requirements for parking lots, roads and  other paved surfaces while supporting  tree root growth under the pavement. The  deep rooting of trees in these soils helps  to prevent heaving of sidewalks, curbs and  gutters by tree roots. However, the amount  of soil with a structural soil is only about     24 Urban Forests: A Climate Adaptation Guide  25  one-third that of native soil so a large space  is required to support each tree (inadequate  soil volume leads to premature decline of  trees).   Soil cells are modular, pre-engineered  plastic cells—much like milk baskets— which are locked together and filled with  soil. The cell structure and pavement takes  the load of the traffic, while tree roots  make use of the soil as a growing medium.  Soil cells provide significantly more soil  per volume than structural soils and are  designed to meet a support up to 3,630 kg   per wheel to a maximum of 14,515 kg per  axle. Greater rooting space allows trees to  grow larger, and thus provide more shade,  interception and other benefits. Although  soil cells appear to be more expensive, they  provide significantly more soil per unit  volume than structural soils so less product  is required, reducing the relative cost.  •  Retain large natural treed areas, which  typically absorb and store more water  than disturbed areas. The runoff from an  undisturbed remnant forest is negligible  compared to open ground and even turf  areas. Native understory will support treed  areas much better than lawns, which have a  poor infiltration rate (at times only slightly  better than pavement).  •  Maintain or restore the historical surficial  hydrology of a site when retaining existing  trees and vegetation in new developments.  Very often, natural water movement on a  site is changed by development and the  vegetation that depended on that water   Figure 13: Bioengineering approach to streambank   Figure 12: Raingarden    25 Adapting Communities to Future Climates  The City of Seattle’s Street Edge Alternatives Project (SEA Streets) was designed to provide drainage  that mimics the natural landscape prior to development. Impervious surfaces were reduced to 11%  less than a traditional street, surface detention was directed to swales, and over 100 evergreen  trees and 1,100 shrubs were added to the street. This approach has reduced the total volume of  stormwater leaving the street by 99%. 38   A school in Qualicum Beach created a raingarden to capture stormwater runoff. Despite one of the  heaviest recorded rainfalls immediately after its completion, the raingarden absorbed all the water  inflow, allowing it to gradually soak into the soil.39    Stormwater from a parking lot at the University of California Davis drains toward a wide, deep swale  planted with London planetrees and filled with a mixture of 75% lava rock and 25% clay-loam soil.  The swale provides a growing medium for trees and shrubs and a storage area for runoff, while the  soil itself helps trap pollutants as the rainwater filters through it. The system is designed to capture  97% of all rainfall events, as well as removing nutrients and heavy metals from the runoff.40  supply dies, as rainwater running off  new impervious surfaces (roof, driveway,  sidewalks and roads) is channelled away  into ‘stormwater management systems’.  Often, with a little bit of thought, rainwater  can be re-directed and dispersed back  into the natural environments, while still  managing the risk of extreme stormwater  events. Be careful in engineering these  rainwater interflows, as too much water can  kill a tree just as readily as too little.   Create Raingardens to Manage Overland Flow  Raingardens are vegetated depressions designed  to absorb precipitation, allowing the water to  soak slowly into the ground.   Direct rainwater into raingardens, allowing the  water to soak into the ground. An additional   benefit of this approach is that these natural  systems filter out many pollutants, especially  from small storm events which are the greatest  source of pollutant loading. Trees in raingardens  help to increase their natural function.   Extreme Weather Events   Use Root Systems to Create Slope Stability  Intense rainstorms, runoff and flooding can  erode soils, especially on steep slopes. Root  systems of trees and large shrubs can be useful  for stabilizing the soil and minimizing erosion.  •  Retain or restore vegetation on steep   slopes. Species of trees and shrubs with  extensive rooting systems, such as willow  species, maple or Sitka alder, are good  candidates. Native willow is particularly  effective if a bioengineering approach is     26 Urban Forests: A Climate Adaptation Guide  27  anticipated (see below).  •  Bioengineer vegetation to stabilize slopes   and streambanks. Biodegradable mesh,  crib walls (logs with holes for willow  and dogwood cuttings) and herbaceous  understory plants (such as wild ginger  or wild strawberry) can be used to  control erosion. Several methods for  riparian restoration are provided in Soil  Bioengineering Techniques for Riparian  Restoration.42  Provide Protection from Strong Winds •  In open areas, create windbreaks by   placing rows of trees perpendicular to the   prevailing wind, about 8–15 m from the  building. Design the windbreak to be longer  than the building (see Figure 15) because  wind speed increases at the edge of the  windbreak. Dense evergreens that grow to  about twice the building height are ideal.  Place them far enough from the building so  that they will not cause property damage if  they blow down or block low-angle winter  sun.    Allow shrubs to form thick hedges, especially on   north, west and east walls, to act as windbreaks.    Wildfire   Interface wildfires are a growing concern in  many interior communities, especially those  surrounded by forests affected by mountain pine  beetle.   Design Communities to Minimize Wildfire Risk  •  Choose ‘fire smart’ trees and landscaping.45    In fire-prone areas, deciduous trees may  be a better choice near buildings (as  coniferous trees are more volatile and have  the greatest potential to produce high-  For more information on rainwater  management at the watershed level, see  Beyond the Guidebook 2010: Implementing a  New Culture for Urban Watershed Protection  and Restoration in British Columbia.41   The City of White Rock has revised its  tree management bylaw to protect trees in  Ecosystem Enhancement Areas (steep slope  and ravine areas) “where the City has targeted  areas of natural drainage and or sloped areas  with a need to preserve or enhance the tree  canopy to protect soils, minimize erosion and  reduce greenhouse gases in conjunction with  the Integrated Storm Water Protection and the  Climate Action Plans.” 43  The District of Saanich has designated  steep slope areas.

A more compact growth form for  communities helps to maintain surrounding  forested areas, and minimizes the amount  of wildfire interface area. If necessary,  follow FireSmart guidelines to treat the  surrounding forested area in order to  minimize the risk of a wildfire causing   damage. The Ministry of Forests, Mines and  Lands has information to guide the design  of new subdivisions, and the planning  and treatment of forests around homes in  existing rural subdivisions or remote areas.47  •  Engage a knowledgeable forester to assist  your community with its wildfire interface  risk management planning. (See also  Section 4.)  Health and Air Quality  Air quality (smog) will likely worsen with climate  change in some regions, especially in summer.   Trees remove air pollutants by trapping  particulate matter in their leaves, needles and  bark. Better air quality reduces health care costs,  and improves the quality of life for everyone,  especially those with compromised health,  such as asthmatics. Beware that trees can also  give off aromatic compounds that can irritate  some people at certain times of the year and  contribute to ground-level ozone formation.  There is considerable species variation in the  emission of volatile organic compounds (VOCs),  so consider this when selecting what tree   species to plant.  Plant Trees to Improve Air Quality  •  Retain healthy large-stature trees. Large   coniferous and broad-leafed trees with  dense foliage collect the most particulate  matter.   •  Plant additional trees in areas where air  quality is a concern, for example along busy  urban roads.   •  Consider long-lived and low-maintenance  trees for these plantings.   •  Plant leafy shrubs in areas not suited to  trees; these too will remove air particulates.   •  Provide ample water for urban trees and  shrubs. This enhances their ability to  remove pollutants in the atmosphere,   Figure 14: Evergreen plantings as a windbreak  The City of Prince George is examining ways  in which trees can help to mitigate air quality  problems.     28 Urban Forests: A Climate Adaptation Guide  29  and their ability to reduce the ambient air  temperature through evapo-transpiration.  Food Production    As global temperatures rise, the tropics and sub- tropics will be significantly affected, reducing  food production in these areas and likely  increasing food costs worldwide.  Provide Opportunities to Grow Local Food  One of the benefits of changing climates is that  many regions of B.C. will be able to grow fruits  and other food crops currently associated with  more southerly locations. Local food production  also helps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.   •  Consider planting fruit and nut trees   currently suited to more southerly climates,   Figure 15: Fruit tree planting, Ucwalmicw Centre Society  Figure 16: Apple trees  in anticipation of being able to get them to  produce fruit as they mature. Ensure they  are hardy enough for the current climate,  or provide appropriate winter protection  such as mulching, wrapping stems, or  windbreaks.  •  Consider what opportunities there may be  in parks or other municipal lands for local  food production (e.g., community gardens,  park trees).   •  Ensure that trees are placed and pruned to  avoid shading community gardens.   Windbreaks can reduce typical home heating  demand by 5–15% (1–3% for a single tree).44     29 Adapting Communities to Future Climates    The City of Victoria has grown ornamental banana trees for many years. In 2010, for the first time, a banana  tree growing in the greenhouse blossomed and produced fruit, likely due to the previous summer’s heat  wave. 48   The City of Victoria also allows the growing of food in city boulevards (with permission).   Carbon Credits from Forests  Retaining and planting treed areas are important for climate mitigation (by sequestering carbon). However,  afforestation (land that has been without forest for much longer than land what would be considered  reforested) is also becoming a source of income to fund climate action (including adaptation programs).   Consider afforestation projects to capture carbon. In May 2010, the Pacific Carbon Trust issued its first call  for proposals to buy carbon offsets created as a result of afforestation (planting) projects, providing that  the carbon sequestration benefits could be verified. Afforestation initiatives need to be over and above that  needed for ‘normal’ or historic levels of urban forest restocking in order to qualify as a valid offset.49  Carbon  credits can also be awarded for avoiding deforestation through the retention of trees.  Consider community energy projects which convert waste wood from parks and forests into energy,  generating revenue and carbon credits. This is part of an Integrated Resource Recovery50  approach to  waste management.     30 Urban Forests: A Climate Adaptation Guide  31  Adapting   URBAN FOREST   MANAGEMENT TO   FUTURE CLIMATES  4 As well as adapting communities to climate change, it is also  important to adapt urban forests so that they survive and thrive  in changing climates. Urban forests are part of a community’s  ‘green’ infrastructure that can be purposefully designed and  managed to provide a myriad benefits to community. However,  these urban forests need maintenance and re-investment just  as much as ‘grey’ infrastructure (roads, sidewalks and pipelines).  In return, they provide a variety of economic and other benefits  (see Planting our Future).  ‘Climate-proofing’ urban forests helps communities to protect  their green infrastructure, manage tree-related risks and reduce  associated insurance costs. Failure to invest in re-structuring the  urban forest to meet future climates could result in increased  costs for clean-up after wind- or snow-storms, or unnecessary  loss to wildfire or pests. Proactive management—an ounce of  prevention—is almost certainly cheaper than an ounce of clean- up after a disaster.  Urban forests in your community are already subject to variable  weather conditions, including extreme events such as heat  waves, dry spells, heavy precipitation, and strong winds. As the  climate changes such events are likely to become more frequent     31  Adapting Urban Forest Management to Future Climates  and more extreme. Average precipitation,  temperature and growing degree days—all  factors that affect tree establishment, growth  and survival—will also change. Trees will likely  be exposed to new pests and diseases as well  as competition from new invasive species. As a  result of the climate change already experienced  during the last century, mature trees that were  planted many years ago may already be showing  signs of distress. For example, many cedars  planted as hedges in Victoria and Vancouver  are unable to survive drier summers without  supplemental irrigation. Seedlings planted  today not only need to grow well under present   conditions but in climates 40–50 years from now.  Adapting urban forests to climate change aims  to reduce their vulnerability to adverse effects  and to create treed environments that will thrive  into the future. This involves:   •  Reducing urban forests’ exposure to risk;  and   •  Increasing urban forests’ resiliency to  disturbances.   Figure 19 shows a diagram prepared as part of  the City of Toronto’s urban forest adaptation  study, and illustrates expected climate change  impacts on the city’s urban forest and potential  adaptation strategies. While it is unlikely that a  small community would be able to implement all  of these adaptation strategies, this diagram may  help communities to generate ideas.  Risk Management   Climate change is exposing urban forests to new  vulnerabilities and risks. Many communities are  all too aware of the increased risk of wildfire and  insect damage associated with climate change.  Other impacts—including drought, extreme   Figure: 17: Maffeo-Sutton Park, City of Nanaimo  i-Tree is a software suite from the USDA Forest Service that provides urban forestry analysis and benefits  assessment tools. i-Tree tools include i-Tree Eco (formerly known as UFORE), which creates spatial mapping  of the urban forest, and can generate a report on the value of its ecosystem services (e.g., air pollution  removal). Other programs allow urban forest managers to determine where and what species to plant for  maximum benefits, and to model the effects of planting programs in various parts of a community. Some  of these applications are currently only available in the U.S., but should be available in Canada in the near  future.     32 Urban Forests: A Climate Adaptation Guide  33  Figure 18: Adaptation strategies for the urban forest in the City of Toronto  This diagram was produced by the Clean Air Partnership in Toronto show the inter-relationships between greenhouse gas   emissions, climate change and related impacts, together with options for addressing these issues.

Get to Know your Urban Forests  •  You can’t manage what you can’t measure.   Inventory and map your urban forests so  that you can better manage the resource  and any risks that may threaten it. Think  carefully about how this information will be  used when developing your data collection  fields. Several web-based tools can provide  assistance, such as the i-Tree tools described  in Planting our Future.  A full mapping and  assessment of the ecological health of a  community brings many benefits including  a good understanding of the condition of  the urban forests. However, the investment  of time and money may be beyond the  means of smaller communities. In this case,  a simple inventory of street and park trees  and their associated environments may be  a good place to start. Note that for many  communities, much of the urban forest  is on private land and this too should be  considered.   •  Use the information gathered in the survey  and mapping of your urban forest to assess  its age, species and condition. Are the age  classes and genera of your forest diverse  enough? How much of your urban forest is  over-mature or, in other words, those trees  that harbour diseases and insects, whose  environmental/social value is diminishing  (e.g. are rotten or are losing branches  during storms), and whose maintenance  costs are much higher than achievable?  Also note the site conditions within which  your trees are growing. Are they dry?  Steeply sloped? Disturbed? Associated with  watercourses or wetlands?  Identify Risk Factors  •  Identify the climatic changes anticipated for   your region (see Section 2). Brainstorm with  others to identify what this could mean for  your urban forest.  •  Assess where vulnerabilities may exist, and  identify the probability of these occurring  and the likely severity of impact (see Figure  19).    The City of Duncan and Cowichan Tribes  developed an urban tree inventory, funded by  a Green Streets Canada grant. The survey was  conducted by one person on a bicycle. As well as  being a low-cost method and environmentally- friendly, this approach provided an opportunity  for the surveyor to meet and talk to residents  about what he was doing.51    Figure 19: Risk evaluation matrix    34 Urban Forests: A Climate Adaptation Guide  35  This will allow you to identify and prioritize  risks.    Plan for the Worst •  Develop emergency response plans for   responding to extreme weather events that  may impact your urban forests. Potential  threats include prolonged drought,  windstorms, rain-or snowstorms, and for  increased flooding, pests, or competition  from invasive species.   The process for developing an extreme weather  plan could include the following:  •  Determine who should be involved  (agencies, groups, government) and their  financial and human resources;  •  Hire a program coordinator to work with  the many different groups and agencies  involved;  •  Have trained staff assess and inventory tree  damage;  •   Provide a list of arborists for each  municipality to assist in damage assessment  and clean-up efforts;  •   Establish a toll-free number and staff to  deal with public inquiries;  •  Prepare press releases and extension notes; •  Prepare and deliver workshops for home   and land owners on tree care before and  after a major storm;  •  Assign work crews to assist in the clean-up  of parks, trails, roads, and waterways; and,  •   Provide on-site advisory service for home  and land owners.52  •  Prepare for higher incidences of pests and  disease. More frost-free days, combined  with earlier spring weather, will increase  the over-wintering survivability of pests.  Warm, moist conditions in spring and fall  will enhance conditions for fungi, mildew  and bacterial diseases of trees. Also prepare  for threats from new invasive pests (such as  Asian long-horned beetle, pine shoot beetle  or emerald ash borer) and ornamental plant  species such as Japanese knotweed, giant  hogweed, and Himalayan balsam.53   •   Establish a process for early detection and  treatment of pests and disease, as this can  minimize or delay the most severe impacts.  Managing infestations could involve  massive removal of infected trees to contain  the spread of disease.   The City of Victoria has an Integrated Pest  Management Policy55  that is part the City’s  environmental stewardship of all public lands  and facilities.   The Community Wildfire Protection Plan  (CWPP) program assists communities in the  development of plans that will assist them  in improving fire prevention and protection  measures in the interface areas. The CWPP will  define risk areas for interface fires, identify  measures necessary to mitigate those risks,  and outline a plan of action to implement the  measures.    35  Adapting Urban Forest Management to Future Climates  •  Develop an integrated pest management  plan. For more information, see Planting  our Future and the Integrated Pest and  the Management Manual for Landscape  Pests in British Columbia.54    •  Develop a community wildfire protection  plan. For information on developing a plan  see the Fuel Management website.56  Local  governments can access funding available  from the Union of B.C. Municipalities  to help develop these plans; First Nations  communities can receive assistance from  Indian and Northern Affairs Canada  and should contact the First Nations   Emergency Services Society (FNESS) for  information.    Address Priority Risks  •  With an arborist’s advice, selectively remove   branches to make vulnerable trees more  wind firm. If the only option is to remove  the hazard tree, consider topping it at  3–5m instead, or leave some large downed  logs on the ground, as these will provide  important wildlife habitat. At the same  time, be strategic about leaving biomass  which could act as forest fuels, increasing  the risk of forest fires.   •  Remove sick or damaged trees to  reduce risks from tree failure or spread  of insects and disease. Ensure that staff  are adequately trained and certified in  Tree Risk Assessment and Integrated Pest  Management.   •  Where there is a high risk of interface fires,  follow the FireSmart guidelines  to reduce  risk to property.  (See also page 27)       Communities such as Revelstoke, Kamloops,  Maple Ridge and the regional districts of  Nanaimo and Okanagan-Similkameen have  already completed Wildfire Protection Plans.   The Neskonlith Indian Band has created  a fire break around the community, and is  planting the fire break with pest-resistant firs to  accelerate forest regeneration.   During the windstorms of 2006–07, more than 10,000 trees in Vancouver’s Stanley Park blew down. Trees  that were deemed a risk to visitors and park workers were removed. About 75% of trees and snags were  retained, and about 80–120 tonnes per ha of fallen trees and stumps were left to provide wildlife habitat.  Exposed trees at the edge of the blowdown area were made wind firm through careful thinning.   The City of Edmonton has prepared an urban forest management plan, which includes a direction to  address the risks from emerald ash borer and Dutch elm disease. Green ash and American elms make up  approximately 46% and 32% of the City’s street trees, respectively.57     36 Urban Forests: A Climate Adaptation Guide  37  The Ministry of Forests, Mines and  Lands provides an online Tree Species  Compendium59  that includes information on  natural distribution, soil preferences, rooting  systems, tolerances, and much more for a variety  of native B.C. tree species.   Evergreen Canada has a Native Plant  database60  (including tree species) that  includes information on preferred growing  conditions.   Species Selection    Species selection is all about finding the right  tree for the right place and time. Consider the  specific needs and challenges of the planting  site, as well as regional conditions and future  climate impacts. Note that this document cannot  provide species-specific guidance as the variety  of ‘suitable’ species varies tremendously with  climate, elevation, hydrology and soils across the  province. Instead, it provides some principles  that may help you to determine appropriate  choices.    Determine the Most Appropriate Species for  your Location and Future Climate •  Consider what tree species do well on   drier, less nutrient-rich sites within your  area. Some species that prefer moist  and nutrient-rich sites may have their  geographic extent reduced as temperatures  warm, particularly in the interior of the   province.  •  Look at regions that currently have the   climate that your community is expecting  by 2050. What species grow well there?  This can provide guidance to the trees  that might do well in your region in future.  For many parts of B.C., this means looking  south or to lower elevations.   •   Consider the use of non-native species,  but do so with considerable care. The  distinction between ‘native’ and ‘non- native’ will become more blurred in the  next decades as species distributions  shift. Whether native or introduced, one  important consideration is whether the  species planted is climatically adapted. This  may make species that are not native to  the area the most resilient choice. However,   Prince George has a program to reduce the  forest fuel in the interface area to reduce risk of  wildfire damage to the city.  Figure 20: Wildlife tree    37  Adapting Urban Forest Management to Future Climates  be cautious of exotic tree and ornamental  species (or their pests) that can become  invasive in neighbouring forests. The black  locust tree, for example, is an invasive  species61 in parts of North America. A safer  choice may be to use species that occur  nearby (not from a different continent) and  are currently at their northern or upper  elevational limit.  Consider Current and Future Tree Stressors  For areas subject to greater heat:   •  Plant heat tolerant trees in locations  impacted by urban heat islands (e.g., in  parking lots or town centres).   •  Create clustered plantings of trees and  shrubs that will create their own micro- climate, and cool the surface and soils   beneath the canopy, allowing a variety of  species to survive under harsher future  climate conditions.   •  Where appropriate, use porous pavers  instead of asphalt, as this will absorb less  heat than black pavement.   Plant pollution-resistant species. Hotter summers  can create greater concentrations of ground- level ozone, which leaves trees vulnerable to  death and disease.    For areas subject to greater drought:  •  Select species habituated to drier sites  in the area or from further south. In  general, native conifers will do better than  deciduous species, because conifers limit  photosynthesis during the dry season.   •   Consider water needs. Trees will be stressed  (and survival rates reduced) in areas with  long drought periods. Combine smart  species selection (drought tolerant) with  best planting practice, generous soil  volumes, mulching (to retain soil moisture),   The City of Grand Forks has a policy to replace  every tree that is removed to maintain the tree  canopy. Trees are selected from a list of native  and climate-appropriate species.  In Toronto and Chicago, neighbourhood watering programs use volunteers to water trees in parks and  neighbourhoods during drought periods.62    Village Tree Way in the Village of Pemberton has been planted with trees that need little watering,  reducing maintenance costs. They also selected non-fruit bearing species that would not attract bears.   San Francisco allows residents to convert a portion of the sidewalk into a landscaped area. Trees and plants  with low water needs are encouraged.     38 Urban Forests: A Climate Adaptation Guide  39  good site design (to allow harvesting of  local rainwater interflows) and water-smart  irrigation systems. Irrigation is most critical  in first three years of establishment. At the  same time, take care not to water native  trees beyond this stage as it could reduce  root depth penetration and make them  more susceptible to blow down.  •  In areas with a cheap and plentiful water  supply (e.g., groundwater), consider  increasing summer watering programs.  Community volunteers could be recruited  to help. Be careful not to overwater species  that grow deep taproots. Under conditions  of over-watering, these species do not  become wind firm and may be susceptible  to blowing down.  For areas subject to more intense rain or flooding  events:  •  Choose trees that can tolerate waterlogged   soils for short periods of time. Select species  that tend to dominate in seasonally wet  sites. Examples of water-tolerant species  include cottonwood, swamp cypress, many  willows, red maple, and alder.   For areas subject to high winds:  •  Choose wind-firm, drought-tolerant species  (as wind desiccates plants). Select species  with attributes such as sound branch  attachments, high wood strength and a  well-distributed root system. Allow for deep  growing soils.  •   Retain open-grown trees that are adapted   to winter storm winds in areas of risk.  Close-growing trees, once thinned, may  be susceptible to blowing down as they  will not have formed broad, secure rooting  systems.  •   Consider planting in larger groups where  possible—trees are more wind firm as a  group than isolated as individuals.   •   Avoid planting on ridge tops or leaving  narrow remnant strips of natural forests on  exposed ground.  Planting and Maintenance   Proper planting and maintenance will give  young trees the best chance of surviving  and thriving. Guidelines for planting and  maintenance are included in Planting our  Future. From a climate adaptation perspective,  the aim is to minimize stress on trees, so that  they can respond better to the challenges  associated with climate change. Key practices  include the following.  Choose the Right Tree for the Right Place and  Right Time •  Select species for the given site conditions   and future climates, as described above.  •   Choose healthy stock with well developed   root systems. Avoid root-bound container  grown stock.  •  Ensure the planting site provides adequate  space for tree root growth. In urban  settings, use structural soils (see page 22).         39  Adapting Urban Forest Management to Future Climates  Use Best Planting Practices  •  Plant in loam soils that are loose (not   compacted) and deep enough to support  healthy root development (at least 60–75  cm).  •  Stake the tree low enough on its stem to  ensure that the roots don’t move, while the  upper portion of the tree can sway.  •   Avoid adding organic amendments to the  soil (<5% by weight or 20% by volume);  instead top dress with about 10 cm of  organic mulch. Do not mulch above root  ball; mulch beyond this point instead, so as  not to encourage fine root development up  into the mulch layer. Irrigate deeply two– three times per week during dry season  (more if in a windy area).  •   Avoid soil compaction, as this can  considerably shorten the life of the tree.   •   Hire or train staff to become ISA Certified  Arborists who are competent in all aspects  of tree care.   Use Best Maintenance Practices  •  Prune young trees to develop a sound   ‘architecture’ that can withstand snowfall,  windstorms, etc. For tree pruning  information see the International Society  for Arboriculture website.63    •  Avoid unintended consequences—such as   damage to bark from mowing machines or  weed-whackers, or damage to roots from  building activities or utility maintenance.  Create turf-free areas around the base of  trees; invest in education and training of  turf-maintenance staff; and place plastic  tree guards around the base of young  boulevard trees.  •  For a variety of best management  practices see the Compendium of Best  Management Practices for Canadian  Urban Forests.64  Monitor Urban Forest Conditions •  Routinely monitor trees for new pests   and diseases. This can help to avoid or  minimize problem insects. It can also avert  a potentially catastrophic infestation from a  foreign pest taking hold, such as the Asian  long-horned beetle or European ash borer. Helpful resources in good planting and early   tree care practice are found at the ISA website  Figure 21: Site preparation, Ucwalmicw Centre Society    40 Urban Forests: A Climate Adaptation Guide  41  Community volunteers can be trained to  help monitor trees in their neighbourhood.   •   Monitor and report on tree conditions. This  is important as it provides feedback on how  trees are responding to climatic changes,  and which species are proving the best- adapted. With the right training, volunteers  can be asked to help with tree monitoring.    Diversity and Resilience  Conservation of biodiversity in the landscape is  a key strategy for coping with climate change.  The term ‘ecosystem resilience’ refers to an  ecosystem’s ability to adjust to and recover  from changing circumstances such as climate  change. The more complex and sizeable the  natural areas that remain, the more likely species  within a landscape will be able to adapt to  change successfully. The more fragmented and  simplified a landscape is, the less likely that  successful adaptation will occur.   Many urban landscapes are quite simplified— such as a row of cherry trees along a downtown  street. This makes them vulnerable to a single  pest disease (e.g., bacterial canker) that could  wipe out all of the trees. A more complex  ecosystem with a variety of tree species and age  classes will likely survive that pest infestation— even if the cherry trees are affected. Resilience  can be improved by conserving natural areas,  increasing species diversity, providing ecosystem  connectivity, careful species selection, and good  planting/maintenance practices.  An International Tree Failure Database (ITFD)  is a searchable database with information on  tree failure from countries throughout the  world. This information is gathered to help  tree managers and researchers worldwide in  uncovering tree failure patterns, allowing for  better prediction of tree failures, the creation of  appropriate standards for species selection and  maintenance, and reduced impacts from tree  failures.65   Ecosystem Resilience at a Landscape Scale  Urban forests are not isolated entities, but  exist within a much larger regional landscape  (ecosystem), sometimes intimately connected  to the surrounding forests, woodlands and  grasslands. It is helpful to think on a range  of scales when developing strategies for  adaptation.     Agencies such as the Ministry of Forests, Mines  and Lands are actively working to develop  climate change adaptation strategies at larger  (bioregional) scales. Recognizing the role of  urban forests within the larger regional context,  and working with other players in this field of  research, can amplify efforts being made at a  more local scale and provide greater access to  resources and expertise    41  Adapting Urban Forest Management to Future Climates  Increase the Biodiversity of Urban Forests  •  Plant a diversity of tree and shrub species.   This avoids monocultures that make it easy  for pests and disease to spread, and raises  the odds that at least some of the tree  species will thrive in future climates and  be resistant to new pests and diseases. The  Municipal Specialist Certification Guide  recommends the “10/20/30 rule”: no more  than 10% of one species or cultivar, 20% of  one genus, or 30% of one family.66   •  Ensure that there is a healthy distribution  of age classes and growth rates within your  tree population. Many communities with  street trees have even-aged trees that are  reaching the end of their safe and useful life.   •  Protect critical habitat and ecosystem  components, particularly around streams  and wetlands. Ensure that riparian setbacks  are adequate to ensure that large trees and  their associated vegetation can be retained  well into the future.  •  Create greenspace connections between  treed and other natural ecosystems. This will  help to support local biodiversity.   The City of Prince George has been  experimenting with different species of trees  in city parks, including cultivars, in case native  trees do not survive changing climates.  The District of Invermere is planting a diversity  of deciduous and coniferous trees to create a  “resistant urban forest”.   The District of Sparwood has removed beetle- killed trees to reduce fire risk in residential  interface areas. The District is replacing is  replanting with a diversity of species and age- classes of trees, in order to reduce the risk of  tree loss from pests and disease.   The Mayne Island Conservancy is working on  a restoration project for Henderson Park that  will enhance the resiliency of the park’s forest  ecosystem.     42 Urban Forests: A Climate Adaptation Guide  43  Five Quick Ideas to  Get Started on   Climate Change   Adaptation  5 Climate change is already here, and its effects on communities  will become even more noticeable over time. Managing urban  forests well is just one part of climate change adaptation, but it  can be an effective and simple place to start—and can generate  numerous co-benefits.   Below are a few ideas to get started.   Get to Know your Urban Forests  •  Conduct an inventory of your urban forest—simple or in-  depth—and determine how well suited it is to the changing  climate in your area. Where are areas of greatest risk? What  are the priorities for action?   Decide What Type of Adaptation is Most Important to Your  Community  •  Find out what the expected effects of climate change are   for your community. What is the most important function  that trees and shrubs can do—slope stabilization? shading?  rainwater infiltration?—and look at how you can enhance  these benefits.     43  Five Quick Ideas to Get Started on Climate Change Adaption  Look After Existing Trees  •  Mature trees provide much greater benefits   than young saplings. Consider how best to  maintain this valuable asset.   Plant Shade Trees Suitable for Current/Future  Climates •  Determine a variety of good tree species for   new community plantings. Then host a tree  planting event—a fun way to engage the  community and provide education about  urban forest values, as well as getting more  trees in the ground. Communicate why you  have chosen these species for this given  location, and what benefits you are aiming  to get from the trees as they mature.   Share Your Wisdom •  Climate change adaptation is a relatively   new concept, and use of urban forests   Figure 22: Tseshaht First Nation and Province of British Columbia Trees for Tomorrow   as a tool to reduce negative impacts on  communities is not well understood.  Share your findings, successes and failures  with your colleagues and people in your  community, so that we can all learn  together.
