Effective conversation requires at any given time a single speaker  communicating and other participants listening.  – Finally, the time-ordered record of the conversation must be consistent such  that each statement makes sense given the previous statement in the  conversation.  Fig-9.1: Shannon-Weaver model of Conversation    8  Fundamentals of Chatbots  • A chatbot is a program that participates in turn-taking  conversations and whose aim is to interpret input text or  speech and to output appropriate, useful responses.  • They require a computational means of grappling with the  ambiguity of language and situational context in order to  effectively parse incoming language and produce the most  appropriate reply.    9  Fundamentals of Chatbots  • A chatbot’s architecture, shown in Figure 9-2, is  comprised of two primary components. – The first component is a user-facing interface that handles the  mechanics of receiving user input (e.g., microphones or a web API)  and delivering interpretable output (speakers or a mobile frontend).  – This outer component wraps the second component, an internal dialog  system that interprets text input, maintains an internal state, and  produces responses.  Fig-9.2: Architecture of a Chatbot    10  Fundamentals of Chatbots  • In this module we will focus on the internal dialog component  and show how it can be easily generalized to any application  and composed of multiple sub-dialogs.  • To that end we will first create an abstract base class that  formally defines the fundamental behavior or interface of the  dialog.  • We will then explore three implementations of this base class  for state management, questions and answers, and  recommendations and show how they can be composed as a  single conversational agent.    11  Module 9 – Section 2  Base Dialog System    12  Dialog system  • A Dialog defines how we handle simple, brief exchanges and is  the basic building block for conversational agents during an  interaction between chatbot and user.  • We will think of a conversation agent as composed of many  internal dialogs that each handle their own area of responsibility  • To ensure dialogs work together in concert, we must describe a  single interface that defines how dialogs operate  • In Python, we can use an abstract base class via the abc  standard library module to list the methods and signatures  expected of all subclasses. In this way we can ensure that all  subclasses of our Dialog interface behave in an expected way  • To create our interface, we’ll break this behavior into several  methods that will be specifically defined in our subclasses    13  Implementing Dialog module  • The implementation starts with a non abstract method, listen, the  primary entry point for a Dialog object that implements the general  dialog behavior using abstract methods  • The listen signature accepts text as a string, as well as a  response boolean that indicates if initiative has passed to the  Dialog and a response is required.  • listen also takes arbitrary keyword arguments (kwargs) that may  contain other contextual information such as the user, session id,  or transcription score.  • The output of this method is a response if required as well as a  confidence score  • Since we may not always be able to successfully parse and  interpret incoming text, or formulate an appropriate response, this  metric expresses a Dialog object’s confidence in its interpretation    14  Implementing Dialog module  • The parse method allows Dialog subclasses to implement their  own mechanism for handling raw strings of data  • The interpret method is responsible for interpreting an  incoming list of parsed sentences, updating the internal state  of the Dialog, and computing a confidence level for the  interpretation  • Finally, the respond method accepts interpreted sentences, a  confidence score, and arbitrary keyword arguments in order to  produce a text-based response based on the current state of  the Dialog    15  Implementing Dialog module    16  Module 9 – Section 3  Rule based Conversation     17  Rule based Greetings Module  • In this section, we will implement a rules-based greeting feature  inspired by these early models, which uses regular expressions to  match utterances.  • Our version will maintain state primarily to acknowledge  participants entering and leaving the dialog, and respond to them  with appropriate salutations and questions.  • The Greeting dialog implements our conversational framework by  extending the Dialog base class.  • At the heart of the Greeting dialog is a dictionary, PATTERNS,  stored as a class variable. This dictionary maps the kind of  interactions (described by key) to a regular expression that defines  the expected input for that interaction.  • In particular, our simple Greeting dialog is prepared for greetings,  introductions, goodbyes, and roll calls    18  Rule based Greetings module    19  Rule based Greetings module    20  Rule based Greetings module    21  Rule based Conversation module    22  Module 9 – Section 4  Question and Answer system    23  Building Question and Answer System  • One of the most common uses of chatbots is to quickly and easily  answer fact-based questions such as “How long is the Nile river?”  • There exists a variety of fact and knowledge bases on the web  such as DBPedia, Yago2, and Google Knowledge Graph  • The challenge is converting a natural language question into a  database query. While statistical matching of questions to their  answers is one simple mechanism for this, more robust  approaches use both statistical and semantic information;  • for example, using a frame-based approach to create templates  that can be derived into SPARQLqueries or using classification  techniques to identify the type of answer required (e.g., a location,  an amount, etc.)    24  Detecting Questions  • The first step of building this system is to detect when we’ve been  asked a question, and to determine what type of question it is.  • An excellent first step is to consider what questions look like  • Though questions are often posed in irregular and unexpected  ways, some patterns do exist.  • To detect these patterns, we will need to perform some type of  syntactic parsing—in other words, a mechanism that exploits  context-free grammars to systematically assign syntactic structure to  incoming text  • We have seen that NLTK has a number of grammer-based parsers,  but all require us to provide a grammar to specify the rules, which  will unnecessarily limit our chatbot’s flexibility  • Next, we will instead explore pretrained parsing model as more  flexible alternatives:  – dependency parsing  – constituency parsing    25  Dependency Parsing  • Dependency parsers are a lightweight mechanism to extract the  syntactic structure of a sentence by linking phrases together with  specific relationships.  • They do so by first identifying the head word of a phrase, then  establishing links between the words that modify the head.  • The result is an overlapping structure of arcs that identify  meaningful substructures of the sentence.  • Consider the sentence “How many teaspoons are in a  tablespoon?”. In Figure 9-3, we see a dependency parse as  visualized using SpaCy’s DisplaCy module  Fig-9.3: Spacy Dependency Tree    26  Implementing Dependency Parsing  • To recreate the parse shown in Figure 9-3, we first load SpaCy’s  prebuilt English language parsing model.  • We then write a function, plot_displacy_tree, that parses incoming  sentences using the prebuilt model and plots the resulting  dependency parse using the displacy.serve method.    27  Problem with Dependency Parsing  • Dependency parsers are extremely popular for producing fast and  correct grammatical analyses and when combined with part-of-  speech tagging, perform much of the work required for phrase-  level analysis.  • However, dependency parsing does not offer as rich and deep a  view of the structure of sentences, and as such, may not always  be sufficient or optimal.  • In our chatbot, we’ll demonstrate how to leverage a more  comprehensive tree representation, the constituency parsing.    28  Constituency Parsing  • Constituency parsing is a form of syntactic parsing whose goal is  to break down a sentence into nested phrase structures  • The output is a tree structure that captures complex  interrelationships between sub-phrases.  • Constituency parsers provide an opportunity to apply tree-  traversal algorithms that easily enable computation on text  • Here we can see a much more complex structure of sub-phrases  and more direct, unlabeled relationships between nodes in the  tree.    29  Constituency Parsing  • Constituency parse trees are comprised of terminal leaf nodes,  the part-of-speech tag, and the word itself  • The nonterminal nodes represent phrases that join the part-of-  speech tags into related groupings  • In our example constituency tree, the root phrase is an SBARQ, a  clause identified as a direct question because it is introduced by a  “wh”-word  Fig 9.4: Constituency parsing of “How many teaspoons are in a   tablespoon”    30  Implementing Constituency Parsing  • The Stanford CoreNLP package can be used to execute constituency  parsing  • NLTK made available a new module nltk.parse.stanford that enables us  to use the Stanford parsers from inside NLTK (assuming you have set up  the requisite .jars and PATH configuration) as follows:    31  Identifying Questions  • The pretrained models in SpaCy and CoreNLP give us a powerful  way to automatically parse and annotate input sentences.  • We can then use the annotations to traverse the parsed  sentences and look for part-of-speech tags that correspond to  questions.  • We can explore how different questions manifest using the Penn  Treebank tags, which we first encountered in “Part-of-Speech  Tagging” in module-2    32  Identifying Questions  • In our example, we can see from the root that our input is an  SBARQ (a direct question introduced by a “wh”-word), which in  this case is a WRB (a “wh”-adverb).    33  Identifying Questions  • The major advantage of using a technique like this for question detection  is the flexibility.  • For instance, if we change our question to “Sorry to trouble you, but how  many teaspoons are in a tablespoon?”, the output is different, but the  WHADJP and WRB question markers are still there    34  Penn Treebank II Tags for Question Detection    35  Implementing Question-Answer Module  • Now we will add to our chatbot is a question-and-answer system that  leverages the pretrained parsers to provide convenient kitchen  measurement conversions (questions about measurements as “How”  questions).  • For our question-type identification task, we will aim to be able to  interpret questions that take the form “How many X are in a Y?”    36  Implemention – Converter class  • The main class we write is Converter, which inherits the behavior of our  Dialog class.  • We need to initialize a Converter with a knowledge base of measurement  conversions, here a simple JSON file stored in CONVERSION_PATH and  containing all of the conversions between units of measure.  • We also initialize a parser (here we use CoreNLP), as well as a stemmer  from NLTK and an inflect.engine from the inflect library, which will enable us  to handle pluralization in the parse and respond methods, respectively.  • Our parse method will use the raw_parse method from CoreNLP to  generate constituency parses as demonstrated in the previous section    37  Implemention- Interpret method  • Next, in interpret method, we initialize a list to collect the  measures we want to convert from and to, an initial confidence  score of 0, and a dictionary to collect the results of our  interpretation  • We retrieve the root of the parsed sentence tree and scan  through the part-of-speech tags for ones that match the adverbial  phrase question pattern (WRB).  • If we identify any numbers (Tag CD: cardinal number) within the  question phrase subtree, we store that in our results dictionary as  the quantity for the target measure.  • Finally, we return a (results, confidence, kwargs) tuple, which the  respond method will use to determine whether and how to  respond to the user    38  Implemention- Interpret method    39  Implementation- Respond Method  • Before implementing our respond method, we need a few helper  utilities.  • The first is convert, which converts from the units of the source  measurement to those of the target measurement.  • We also need to add round, pluralize, and numericalize methods,  which leverage utilities from the humanize library to transform  numbers to more natural human-readable form  • Finally, in the respond method, we check to see if our confidence in  our interpretation is sufficiently high, and if so, we use convert to  perform the actual measurement conversions, and then round,  pluralize, and numericalize to ensure the final response is easy for the  user to read    40  Implementation- Respond Method    41  Implementation- Respond Method    42  Implementation- Listen Method  • Now we can experiment with using the listen method on a few  possible input questions to see how well our Converter class is able  to handle different combinations and quantities of source and target  units.    43  Module 9 – Section 5  Recommender system    44  Building Recipe Recommender module  • In this section we will be adding a module to our chatbot – a  recipe recommender.  • As shown in the pipeline, there will be two phase of this module:  – In Build phase, we need to train a recommender system through using a  classification algorithm and a cooking corpus  – In Deploy phase, it will suggest a recipe based on the ingredients during  conversation with a user.  Fig-9.5: Recipe Recommender Schema    45  Building Recommender model  • To train our recommender, we’ll be using a cooking corpus  comprised of blog posts and articles that contain recipes for specific  dishes as well as narratives and descriptions for those dishes.  • We will build the pipeline that will leverage a recipe corpus to perform  text normalization, vectorization, and dimensionality reduction, and  finally use a nearest-neighbor algorithm to provide recipe  recommendations.  • Usually the main challenges of using nearest-neighbor algorithms is  the complexity of search increases as dimensionality increases;  Hence, in case of text applications, dimensionality reduction is often  an important step.  • Also we will leverage a less computationally expensive alternative to  traditional unsupervised nearest-neighbor search – Ball tree  algorithm.    46  Implementation- BallTreerecommender  • First, we’ll create a BallTreeRecommender class, which is  initialized with a k for the desired number of recommendations  (which will default to 3), paths to a pickled fitted transformer  svd.pkl, and fitted ball tree tree.pkl.  • If the model has already been fit, these paths will exist, and the  load method will load them from disk for use.  • Otherwise, they will be fitted and saved using ScikitLearn’s  joblib serializer in our fit_transform method.  • Once a sklearn.neighbors.BallTree model has been fitted, we  can use the tree.query method that uses the fitted transformer  to vectorize and transform incoming text and return only the  indices for the closest recipes.    47  Implementation- BallTreerecommender    48  Implementation- BallTreerecommender    49  Recommending recipe during chat  • Once we have fit our BallTreeRecommender on our pickled recipe  corpus and saved the model artifacts, we can now implement the  recipe recommendations in the context of our Dialog abstract  base class.  • We will be reusing “HTML PickledCorpusReader” class we  defined earlier, except that we will be adding a titles() method that  will allow us to grab the page titles from each HTMLfile, which will  give us a human-intelligible way to refer to each recipe.    50  Recommending recipe during chat  • Our new class RecipeRecommender is instantiated with a pickled  corpus reader and an estimator that implements  BallTreeRecommender model.  • If the recommender isn’t already fitted, the __init__ method will  ensure that it is fit and transformed.  • Next, the parse method splits the input text string into a list and  performs part-of-speech tagging.  • The interpret method takes in the parsed text and determines  whether it is a list of ingredients. If so, it transforms the utterance into  a collection of nouns and then assigns a confidence score according  to the percent of the input text that is nouns.  • Finally, the respond method takes in the list of nouns extracted from  the interpret method as well as the confidence. If interpret has  successfully extracted a sufficient number of nouns from the input,  the confidence will be high enough to generate recommendations.    51  Recommending recipe during chat    52  Recommending recipe during chat  One Sample Result:    53  Module 9 – Section 5  Resources and Wrap-up    54  • Complete the notebook in the assignments section for this   week  Homework    55  • Scaling with Multiprocessing and Spark  • Reading:  Chapter 11 textbook  Next Class     56  Join the conversation with us online:  facebook.com/uoftscs  @uoftscs  linkedin.com/company/university-of-toronto-school-of-continuing-studies  @uoftscs  Follow us on social    57  Any questions?    58  Thank you for choosing the University of Toronto   School of Continuing Studies  Thank You   \n"
