This Primer is a resource for coastal management authorities (mainly local governments) to help 
them identify and evaluate options for adapting to the impacts of sea level rise and associated 
hazards. The Primer is intended to be relevant for southern coastal regions across Canada with 
application to British Columbia, Quebec, and the Atlantic region.

Executive Summary

Climate change is here, increasing global loss of life and property damage as weather patterns change. We 
now know that with climate change comes rising seas – and that this sea level rise will dramatically affect 
Canada’s southern coastal communities.1 These communities  will require resilience and adaptive capacity 
to ensure their long-term sustainability. 

Coastal hazards associated with sea level rise include:
•   Coastal inundation and reduced drainage capacity;
•   Coastal erosion;
•   Changes to coastal habitats and loss of wetlands such as salt marshes;
•   Reduction in coastal sea ice; and
•  More frequent and intense storms, storm surge and wave action.

This Primer provides an introduction to past and future sea levels, an overview of four different adaptation 
strategies, a recommended framework for decision making and finally a total of 21 adaptation tools to 
support local adaptation action. 

The B.C. Ministry of the Environment commissioned the preparation of this Sea Level Rise Adaptation 
Primer for Canada’s Atlantic and Pacific coasts. Although this Primer was prepared in B.C., legislative 
provisions, policies and local government applications discussed in this Primer include B.C., southern 
Quebec and the Atlantic coasts of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland  
and Labrador. Coastal communities along Hudson Bay and in the Arctic face a different set of vulnerabilities 
and were not considered within the context of this research.
Adaptation strategies to sea level rise can be grouped as follows:

Protect

Accommodate

Retreat

Avoid

Protect is a reactive strategy to protect people, property and infrastructure from sea level rise and is 
typically the first response considered. Protecting the coastline through structural mechanisms such as 
dikes, seawalls and groynes has been the traditional approach to dealing with sea level rise in many parts 
of the world. With increasing sea level rise and coastal vulnerability, this strategy may be prohibitively 
expensive and have limited long-term effectiveness in highly vulnerable locations.
Accommodate is an adaptive strategy that allows continued occupation of coastal areas while changes 
are made to human activities and/or infrastructure to adapt to sea level rise. Accommodation can also 
involve retrofitting a building or making it more resilient to the consequences of sea level rise. Other 
accommodation measures may include liability reduction, such as a covenant indemnifying governments 
from the consequences of coastal hazards regardless of protection works undertaken.

Retreat or Managed Retreat refers to any strategic decision to withdraw, relocate or abandon private or 
public assets at risk due to sea level rise and associated coastal hazards. Retreat is an adaptive strategy to 
limit the use of structural protection, discourage development in areas subject to sea level rise, and plan  
for the eventual relocation of buildings and infrastructure to areas with no risk or lesser risk.
Avoid involves ensuring new development does not take place in areas subject to coastal hazards 
associated with sea level rise or where the risk is low at present but will increase over time. This may involve 
identifying future “no build” areas within local government planning documents. A wide range of planning 
tools may be involved, leading to a decision to avoid development in areas subject to moderate to high 
risk. An avoid strategy may involve land acquisition or the transfer of development potential to areas of 
lower risk.

These adaptation strategies are not mutually exclusive. Two or more strategies may be applied in different 
geographic areas by the same local government. The most appropriate strategy for a geographic area may 
also change over time. To implement these strategies, a wide range of adaptation tools are available.
Adaptation tools included in this Primer should be considered in the context of information 
gathering, public education and community engagement, all crucial to informed decision-making 
processes within our democratic system.

Planning tools in this Primer include local government growth management objectives and 
policies, mapping of potential coastal hazards, risk management and emergency preparedness.
Regulatory tools include the regulation of subdivision, land use and buildings. These 
regulatory tools are generally prescribed by legislation and require the approval of a decision-
maker or “gatekeeper” responsible for the protection of the public interest.
Land use change or restriction tools focus on the change or restriction of land 
use other than through the regulatory functions noted above. Some of these tools are at 
the disposal of local government and others may be undertaken by private landowners or 
community groups in order to achieve local government goals.
Structural tools consist of physical structures on land or in water to protect land and 
buildings from coastal hazards. A wide range of hard protection and armouring fit in this 
category. 
Non-structural or soft armouring measures include the creation or restoration 
of wetlands, building sand dunes, or rehabilitation and beach nourishment. Both sand dunes 
and beaches are naturally occurring features, created by the interaction of wind, waves and 
sediment. They serve to dissipate the energy of storm surges and wave action. These natural 
features can be mimicked or recreated to provide an adaptive buffer to sea level rise.

Several of these tools are interdependent and should be used in combination. While structural and non-
structural adaptation tools may appear to represent polar opposites, combining them and creating hybrid 
shoreline protection systems may result in synergies and cumulative benefits. As one example, living 
shorelines are hybrid protection systems that use coastal ecosystems to reduce erosion risk and optimize 
natural shoreline functions.

An analysis of each adaptation tool is provided in this Primer. The analysis includes a description of the tool, 
a discussion of implementation methods and an identification of the enabling legislation, where applicable. 
Advantages and disadvantages of the tool are also examined using a ‘triple bottom line’ approach.

In addition to tools available to local governments, insurance and emergency management are also 
adaptation tools included in the Primer. Overland flood insurance for residential development, while not 
a tool available to the public or any level of government in Canada, is discussed as it plays a major role 
in all other G8 countries. Emergency management is a tool available to communities across Canada, but 
responsibility for emergency management is shared with senior governments.

Also included in the Primer are appendices consisting of: acronyms; a glossary of terms; a spreadsheet 
profiling the adaptation tools; legislative matrices in B.C. and Atlantic Canada; and a wide range of 
municipal policies and bylaws in Atlantic Canada. The Primer concludes with both an annotated 
bibliography and a bibliography organized into four geographic areas: Canada, Quebec, U.S.A.,  
and other international areas.

Introduction

Even if greenhouse gas emissions halt tomorrow, the impacts of climate change will continue into the 
foreseeable future. One of the recognized impacts of climate change – and potentially the most dramatic 
for the many coastal communities of Canada – is sea level rise (SLR).2
As oceans warm, they expand, raising global sea levels. Melting ice caps, mountain glaciers, and land based 
ice sheets (e.g. Antarctica and Greenland) also contribute to rising sea levels. In several areas on Canada’s 
coast, geophysical factors, including subsidence and tectonic forces, also play a role. Coastal hazards 
associated with sea level rise include coastal inundation, erosion, loss of intertidal habitat (‘coastal squeeze’) 
and loss of sea ice. Climate change also brings the prospect of more frequent and intense storms and floods 
– particularly if storms occur during high tides.3 

Observed Changes in Sea Level
In the latter part of the 19th century and during the 20th century, the global mean sea level rose at  
a rate of about 1.7 mm/year (17 cm/century).4 Since 1993, the rate of global sea level rise has increased  
to around 3 mm/year. 

Figure 1 - Global Trends in Mean Sea Level (IPCC, 2007)

The red curve shows reconstructed sea levels from 1870 to 1950. The blue curve shows coastal tide gauge 
measurements from 1950, and the black curve is based on satellite altimetry. The upper and lower limits in 
the curves show 90% confidence levels, which have narrowed over time due to the increasing accuracy of 
data measurement techniques.

Storm surge is one of the more common coastal hazards associated with sea level rise and a significant 
contributor to coastal flooding. A storm surge refers to a temporary increase in the height of the sea due to 
extreme meteorological conditions such as low atmospheric pressure and/or strong winds. A storm surge 
is independent of a high tide, but its impact may be magnified during a high tide. In addition, sea level rise 
accentuates the risks from storm surge activity as higher water levels advance further inland and affect 
areas of higher elevation. It is anticipated that climate change will cause more intense and frequent storms 
in the northern hemisphere and that sea level rise will increase the coastal areas at risk from these events.5 
While a storm surge temporarily raises relative sea level, wave action is a more destructive force associated 
with storms. Shoreline type and exposure to open water will determine wave intensity and frequency and 
therefore the effects of increased wave action and height on erosion and flooding. In addition to relative 
sea level, waves are affected by bathymetry of the near shore (i.e. off-shore depth and topography). 
Increases in sea level may cause wave impacts to reach further inland or overtop defences that were 
previously sufficient, causing damage and flooding. 

Global factors contributing to sea level rise include thermal expansion, melting of glaciers and ice caps, 
the melting of the Greenland ice sheet and the melting of the Antarctic ice sheet. From 1961-2003, melting 
glaciers and ice caps contributed the most to the increase in sea level rise. From 1993 to 2003, the increased 
global rate was due mainly to thermal expansion.

On the B.C. coast, sea level rise has occurred in most locations but at a lower rate than the global average 
of 17 cm/century. Tectonic changes are a major factor on the B.C. coast, with structural uplift occurring on 
the west coast of Vancouver Island and subduction occurring in the Strait of Georgia. Other regional factors 
include the subsidence of alluvial soils in the Fraser River estuary and postglacial rebound. Historic sea level 
rise changes along the B.C. coast include the following:6
•  Prince Rupert 
•  Vancouver  
•  Victoria 
• 
Tofino 

9.8 cm/century
2.0 cm/50 years
3.1 cm/50 years
-16.8 cm/century 

In Nova Scotia, the present rate of sea level rise is higher than the global mean; during the 20th century,  
the increase was about 30 cm. This trend is exemplified at the Fortress of Louisburg National Historic Site 
(Cape Breton, N.S.) where a 1740s ship’s mooring ring is located half a metre below today’s high tide level 
(see following photo).

In much of Atlantic Canada, sea level rise has exceeded the global increase due to the additional effect of 
regional subsidence of the Earth’s crust. This subsidence is caused by the gradual collapse and migration 
of an area of uplift that developed around the margins of the North American ice sheets and by additional 
water loading on the seabed of the Gulf of St. Lawrence as global mean sea levels have risen. This 
phenomenon is referred to as “glacial isostatic adjustment.”7 In Nova Scotia, subsidence is estimated to be up 
to 20 cm/century.8 In Halifax, approximately half of the relative sea level rise is due to global mean sea level 
rise, with the remaining half due to regional subsidence. 

On the other hand, the north shore of the Gulf of St. Lawrence in Quebec and Labrador is rebounding. Based 
on long-term harbour records, the following sea level rise trends have been documented:

•  Halifax, Nova Scotia  
•  Yarmouth, Nova Scotia 
•  North Sydney, Nova Scotia  
•  Pictou, Nova Scotia  
•  Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island 
•  Saint John, New Brunswick 
Projected Increases in Sea Level
How will sea level change in the future? 

32 cm/century (records from 1920-2008)
30 cm/century (records from 1967-2008)
30 cm/century (records from 1970-2008)
24 cm/century (records from 1966-1995)
32 cm/century (records from 1911-2008)
22 cm/century (records from 1906-2008) 

How much sea level rise will occur is subject to uncertainty – and the longer the time frame, the greater the 
degree of uncertainty. 

In its Fourth Assessment Report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projected global sea 
level rise using six different scenarios of future greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Variables used to determine 
GHG emissions included population projections, economic growth and the use of technology. 

Depending on the IPCC scenario used, the estimated rise in global sea level to the end of this century (i.e. 
2100) varies from 18 to 59 cm. Based on the large body of research which has taken place since the IPCC 
scenarios were prepared in 2007, these projections may be quite conservative. Recent scientific research 
based on empirical relationships between atmospheric carbon concentrations and sea levels in the 
paleoclimatological record suggests that the upper bounds of physically plausible sea level rise is larger  
than once thought, owing to thermal expansion and glacial and ice sheet melt. These “semi-empirical”  
studies generally project a sea level rise of between 0.47 m and 1.9 m by the year 2100.9  

Both B.C. and Atlantic Canada recommend planning for sea level rise of approximately 1.0 m by the year 2100. 
A 2011 study for the Government of B.C. recommended sea level rise planning levels of 0.5 metres (50 cm) to 
the year 2050, 1.0 metre to the year 2100 and 2.0 metres to the year 2200.10 This is higher than the 2007 IPCC 
scenarios but is consistent with sea level rise projections used for planning purposes in Europe and the U.S.A.

Even if drastic measures are undertaken to slow down or even stop carbon emissions, sea levels will 
continue to rise for many centuries after global temperatures stabilize: a reality which has significant 
implications for local government planning.11 Planning for sea level rise presents a challenge for local 
governments; especially as many communities in Canada are relatively young and growing rapidly. For 
example, the first local government to be incorporated in B.C. was New Westminster in 1859 and the oldest 
continuously occupied building in the province is less than 170 years old.

Most buildings and infrastructure have a lifespan much longer than the 20-30 year future time period 
often used when designing infrastructure and planning communities. Planning for a century of change is 
a challenge, but is a realistic goal given the implications of projected sea level rise. Figure 2 (below) shows 
the effect of incremental increases in minimum building elevation planning over time, based on a 100 year 
lifespan for a structure.

Regardless of the time frame used, observations and predictions of sea level rise will need to be periodically 
re-evaluated. Predictions of sea level rise will continue to evolve and be refined as the science progresses 
and more data becomes available.
Vulnerability and Adaptation
The impact of sea level rise on Canada’s coastal zones depends largely on the vulnerability of coastal 
communities.  A community’s vulnerability is a function of its exposure and sensitivity to a hazard or 
environmental change and its adaptive capacity or resilience. Adaptive capacity is a function of local context 
and refers to a community’s ability to adapt to potential impacts, as well as cope with specific events, based 
on its social, economic and institutional resources.12 Vulnerability can therefore be lowered by adaptation 
measures which reduce exposure to (or risk from) a hazard or by increasing resilience.13 

Some of Canada’s greatest vulnerabilities to climate change lie in coastal areas, which are home to 
concentrated populations, economic centres and valuable ecosystems.14 Although Canada has a vast 
coastline, the inhabited coastal area represents only 2.6% of the total land area. In 2001, 38.3% of the 
Canadian population lived within 20 kilometres (km) of a marine or Great Lakes shoreline. Of this total, 
approximately 4.9 million people, or 23%, lived on the Pacific coast, and 20% lived on the Atlantic coast.15 

By 2015, it is estimated that a majority of Canadians (50.7%) will be living within 20 km of the coast or the 
Great Lakes, with the greatest concentration of people living within 5 km of a shoreline.16

A proactive approach to sea level rise adaptation is more cost effective and less disruptive than a reactive 
approach. Adaptation should ideally aim to create resilient communities through a triple bottom line 
approach that (1) minimizes the unplanned loss of land and physical capital such as infrastructure;

(2) reduces coastal flood risks to acceptable levels in human settlements; and (3) retreats in a planned and 
efficient way from areas that cannot be protected in a cost-effective manner.17 Adaptation is more than 
the simple implementation of a suitable practice or technology. Sea level rise is a progressive and dynamic 
process and continuous adaptation is required. Adaptation should be viewed by community decision 
makers as an ongoing process whereby risks and opportunities are prioritized, risk reduction measures are 
implemented and their effectiveness is tracked and assessed.

Coastal Sensitivity
Natural Resources Canada has mapped the sensitivity of Canada’s coastlines to a rise in sea level. 
Sensitivity here means the degree to which a coastline may experience physical changes such as 
flooding, erosion, beach migration and coastal dune destabilization. The sensitivity index is a product 
of seven variables: relief (topography), geology, coastal landform, sea level tendency, shoreline 
displacement, tidal range and wave height. 

Approximately 7,000 kilometres of coastline are considered sensitive to sea level rise.18 Most of the British 
Columbia coast has a low sensitivity, mainly due to relief, geology and coastal landforms. However, 
the areas at greatest risk are home to significant concentrations of population, built infrastructure and 
economic activity. Major areas of Atlantic Canada (in particular the coasts of Nova Scotia, Prince Edward 
Island and New Brunswick) are considered to have a high sensitivity to sea level rise. In addition, small  
areas of high sensitivity occur locally in B.C., Quebec, and Newfoundland and Labrador.

Primer Focus Area

Primer Focus Area

This Primer focuses on adaptation tools for Canada’s southern coasts, namely the provinces of British 
Columbia, Quebec, and the Atlantic Provinces of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and 
Newfoundland and Labrador. At 243,000 kilometres, Canada’s shoreline is the longest in the world.19 Although 
largely undeveloped, coastal areas contain many of Canada’s major population and economic centres. 
British Columbia
POPULATION 4,400,057 (2011 CENSUS)

The B.C. coastline has a total length of approximately 29,000 km,20 including the mainland and all islands 
from Haida Gwaii south to Vancouver Island and the Gulf Islands. Although dominated by rocky high-relief 
shores, the B.C. coast also has numerous long, twisting, deep fjords and some wide sand beaches. Over 80% 
of the population of B.C. lives within 5 km of the coast.21 

In the Lower Mainland, where the majority of the population resides, there are many areas close to sea 
level which are vulnerable to the potential effects of sea level rise. In most cases these areas are currently 
protected by structural features such as dikes. Areas currently protected by dikes include the City of 
Richmond, Ladner and waterfront areas in New Westminster, Port Moody and White Rock as well as all Delta 
and Surrey farmland. Waterfront areas in Vancouver – including Stanley Park, Southlands, False Creek, West 
and North Vancouver and the Vancouver International Airport are also protected by dikes. In addition, most 
Musqueam, Tsawwassen, Semiahmoo, Tsleil Waututh and Squamish First Nations lands, all in the Lower 
Mainland, are close to sea level. Over 4,600 hectares of farmland and over 15,000 hectares of industrial and 
urban residential areas in the Lower Mainland are located within 1 metre of sea level.22 On Vancouver Island, 
almost all communities have ocean exposure and many have vulnerable coastlines or low-lying areas. 
Along the northern coast of B.C., critical infrastructure in the Port of Prince Rupert is close to sea level, as  
are most settlements on Haida Gwaii. 

In all, some 59 of 161 municipalities and 14 of 29 regional districts in B.C. consist of coastal communities 
or have some direct coastline exposure. British Columbia’s Local Government Act allows local governments 
to manage land use in coastal areas using a range of tools including official community plans and 
zoning bylaws. Flood Hazard Area Land Use Management Guidelines released by the province in 2004 
recommend a minimum Flood Construction Level of 1.5 m above the natural boundary of the sea and 
a minimum building setback distance from the sea of 15 m. While local governments are required to 
consider these guidelines when establishing floodplain bylaws, the manner in which the guidelines are 
applied varies by municipality. 

A 2011 study commissioned by the B.C. government23 recommended sea level rise planning levels of 
0.5 metres (50 cm) to the year 2050, 1.0 metres to the year 2100 and 2.0 metres to the year 2200 (see Figure 2) 
plus adjustments for local rates of vertical land movement (uplift or subsidence). Sea level rise will not take 
place uniformly along the B.C. coast. Variations will occur due to the settlement of alluvial soils, aquifer 
reduction caused by fresh water removal, and tectonic change as the Juan de Fuca plate subducts beneath 
the North American plate. In addition, because of land subsidence in the Fraser River delta, relative sea level 
will increase by an additional 1–2 mm per year, primarily affecting Richmond, Delta, Queensborough and 
the New Westminster Quay. Post-glacial rebound and tectonic uplift partially mitigate global sea level rise

in some locations24 of B.C. such as on the west coast of Vancouver Island. In the most sensitive areas, much 
of today’s coastal wetlands, barrier beaches and lagoons will be underwater, and coastal structures will 
become increasingly vulnerable to flood damage. 
Quebec
POPULATION 7,903,001 (2011 CENSUS)

The coastal region of Quebec stretches northeast of Quebec City and around the Gulf of St. Lawrence 
for 3,500 km. The Gulf of Saint Lawrence is the world’s largest estuary covering an area of about 236,000 
square kilometres. The Gulf begins in Quebec as the outlet for the Great Lakes which travel along the Saint 
Lawrence River on their way to the Atlantic Ocean. The north coast (Côte Nord region) has 1,825 km of 
coastline. Just over a third of this coastline is comprised of primarily rocky cliffs, 38% is rocky cliffs with 
shallow beach, lagoon or estuary covering over the rock substratum and the remainder of the coastline 
consists of beaches, lagoons or estuaries. The south coast and islands (Bas-Saint-Laurent and Gaspésie-Iles-
de-la-Madeleine regions), are comprised of 1500 km of coastline. Approximately half of the coastline for la 
Gaspésie consists of rocky cliff escarpments, soft clay cliffs, sandy beaches and marshes.25 Over two thirds of 
the Magdalen Islands (Îles-de-la-Madeleine) coastline is sandy beaches, and the rest are soft clay cliffs and 
lagoons. It is estimated that 40% of the Bas-Saint-Laurent coastline is comprised of sandy beaches and the 
rest consists of marshes, rocky cliffs and clay cliffs.26

The province of Quebec consists of 17 administrative regions under provincial jurisdiction of which the 
regions of Côte-Nord, Bas-Saint-Laurent, and Gaspésie-Iles-de-la-Madeleine have coastlines exposed to 
the effects of sea level rise. Within these regions are 121 municipalities, home to a population of over 
400,000 people. Most of the 121 municipalities along the coastal areas apply a 10–15 metre setback for the 
protection of the shorelines. This was established in 1987 by provincial policy. Some municipalities have 
adopted more stringent regulations based on detailed research on local erosion rates and corresponding 
government recommendations. 

Not all coastal areas of Quebec have been or will continue to experience sea level rise in the same way. 
Some areas, such as Sandy Hook in Havre-Aubert on the Magdalen Islands, are in fact increasing their 
coastal reach into the sea through natural processes of erosion and sediment transport. Other communities 
are extending their coastal land area through dredging. Dramatic erosion during storm events is affecting 
the Côte-Nord region; and subsidence is affecting parts of the Bas-Saint-Laurent region and Chaleur Bay 
(Baie-des-Chaleurs) on the east point of the Gaspésie region.27

Atlantic Canada
More than 2.3 million people live in the Atlantic region, most of them in urban areas and smaller 
communities along the coastline.28 In 2001 it was estimated that over 60% of the population on the  
Atlantic Coast (including Quebec) lived within 5 km or less of the shoreline.29 

The largest region of high sensitivity to sea level rise is in Atlantic Canada and includes large parts of the 
coasts of Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick.30 In the Atlantic region, unlike other parts 
of Canada, the predicted effects of climate change, such as sea level rise and the increased occurrence 
and intensity of extreme weather events, are compounded in many coastal areas by post-glacial crustal 
subsidence. This increases coastal erosion and flooding, placing dikelands, coastal populations and their 
infrastructure and industries at risk.31

All four provinces have assumed a sea level rise of approximately one metre by the year 2100. This takes 
into consideration a component for the sinking or rising of the earth’s crust as the result of a rebound 
effect from the last ice age, including consideration of vertical land movement. There is considerable 
consistency in the analysis and documentation of issues amongst the four provinces. Nevertheless, the 
legal and policy framework for dealing with coastal zone planning and development varies for each 
Atlantic province. Newfoundland and Labrador is the only Atlantic jurisdiction which has set a province 
wide high water design standard for sea level rise, storm surge and wave action in coastal areas; it is 
set for a 1:100 year return period. The other Atlantic Provinces rely on the generally accepted coastal 
engineering design standards for the life of structures in coastal areas, which is assumed to be 50 years. 
One major exception to this standard is the Confederation Bridge between New Brunswick and Prince 
Edward Island, which was built one metre higher to account for  
sea level rise over the 100 year design life of the project.

New Brunswick
POPULATION 751,171 (2011 CENSUS)

The province of New Brunswick has approximately 5,500 km of salt-water coastline, which extends from 
the Gaspé Region to the Nova Scotia border and along the Bay of Fundy from The Saint Croix River to the 
Nova Scotia border. There is great diversity in the coastline from the rugged and grassy dunes along the 
Acadian Peninsula and Chaleur Bay to the sandy shores of the Northumberland Strait and the rocky cliffs 
of the Bay of Fundy.32

Nearly 60% of the population lives within 50 kilometres of the coast and there has been significant pressure 
for coastal development in recent years. Between 1990 and 1999, 6,268 new coastal lots were created – an 
average of 627 new coastal properties per year.33 A total of 8 provincial counties and 50 municipal areas 
within them have coastline or areas exposed to the effects of sea level rise. The Gulf of St. Lawrence coast of 
New Brunswick is considered to have the highest sensitivity to sea level rise and associated storm impacts.34

Coastal Areas 
Protection Policy)

The New Brunswick Department of Environment and Local Government produced a Coastal Areas 
Protection Policy for New Brunswick in 2002. The New Brunswick coastal policy is enforced via existing 
provincial legislation such as environmental impact assessment requirements or watercourse alteration 
approvals. These provincial requirements also apply within municipalities, and some municipalities have 
incorporated either elements of or the entire coastal zone policy directly into their bylaws.

Estimates of global sea level rise in conjunction with the best estimates of local vertical motion have 
been used to predict 0.9 to 1.05 metres of total sea level rise over the next century for the coastlines  
of New Brunswick.35

Nova Scotia
POPULATION 921,727 (2011 CENSUS)

The province of Nova Scotia has 13,300 km of jagged coastline that includes some 3,800 coastal  
islands, bays and estuaries.36 Development in Nova Scotia tends to be clustered with a high intensity  
of residences along the coast. The Province of Nova Scotia estimates 70% of the province’s population 
lives on or near the coastline.37 

Much of Nova Scotia is considered highly sensitive to sea level rise and has been experiencing extensive 
construction and creation of parcels in scenic coastal locations – many of which will be in hazard zones in 
a few decades.38 The south coast and eastern shores of Nova Scotia have been shown to have significant 
sensitivity to sea level rise and associated storm impacts.

The Province of Nova Scotia includes 55 municipalities, three regional municipalities, 21 rural municipalities 
and 31 towns – the majority of which are on the coast or in areas potentially subject to coastal hazards 
associated with sea level rise. The Province has delegated land-use, or zoning powers, to the municipalities 
through the Municipal Government Act and the Halifax Regional Municipality Charter. These powers allow 
municipalities to develop planning strategies and bylaws to regulate land use. In spite of this, only about 
45% of provincial land has comprehensive municipal plans or land-use bylaws in place.39 Development on 
the shoreline continues with no buffers mandated except for a few designated protected beaches. 

Nova Scotia has in place a Coastal Management Framework, which provides a foundation for governments 
and citizens to work together to ensure the sustainable use and protection of coastal areas and resources. 
The provincial priority coastal issues include coastal development, coastal access, sea level rise and storm 
events, working waterfronts, coastal water quality, and coastal ecosystems and habitats. This Framework 
provides an outline of how the province plans to move forward in protecting and maintaining its valuable 
coastal resources.

In 2002, the Province of Nova Scotia created a Provincial Oceans Network, which is comprised of 
representatives from provincial departments and agencies with responsibilities and interests in coastal 
and ocean management. Chaired by the Department of Fisheries & Aquaculture, the Provincial Oceans 
Network serves two core functions: 1) to provide advice and expertise in implementation of the Coastal 
Management Framework, and 2) to facilitate coordination on coastal and ocean management issues and 
initiatives within the provincial government.40 

The Government of Nova Scotia has made coastal management a priority with the release of its State of 
Nova Scotia’s Coast Report. This Report provides baseline information on the province’s coastal areas and 
resources which will be used to develop a Coastal Strategy. A draft of the Coastal Strategy was released in 
2012 and one of the key objectives is that buildings and infrastructure be located, built and maintained  
in a manner that minimizes impacts from rising sea levels and storms.

Present rates of relative sea level rise differ all over Nova Scotia due to varying rates of vertical land 
movement across the province. Estimates of relative SLR for Nova Scotia range between 0.7 to 1.4 m  
by the end of the century.41

Prince Edward Island
POPULATION 140,204 (2011 CENSUS)

The Province of P.E.I. has an ocean-influenced coastline of approximately 3,200 km. The coastline is deeply 
indented by tidal inlets, estuaries and salt marsh and generally alternates between headlands of steep 
sandstone bluffs and extensive sandy beaches. The north shore of the Island, facing the Gulf of St Lawrence, 
features extensive sand-dune formations.42 The coast of P.E.I. has been identified as one of the areas most 
sensitive to sea level rise in the entire country. Factors contributing to this sensitivity include soft sandstone 
bedrock, a sandy and dynamic shore zone which is sediment starved in places, low terrain behind the shore 
with significant flooding potential and documented high rates of shoreline retreat.43

Given P.E.I.’s size and shape – the island is only 224 km long and between 6 km and 64 km wide – a 
significant proportion of the population lives on or near the coast.

Parts of the North Shore of P.E.I. are rated highly sensitive because this coast is exposed to the open Gulf 
of St. Lawrence, with potential wave-generating fetches44 of several hundred kilometres. Decreased sea-
ice cover in winter may increase the amount of open water fetch, creating larger waves superimposed on 
storm surges.45 Although Charlottetown Harbour is largely protected from the Northumberland Strait and 
the Gulf of St. Lawrence, relative sea level is rising and storm-surge events are increasingly common. 

The provincial government has a major role in land use planning in P.E.I., managing about 90% of the land 
area in the province. The 31 municipal governments, which practise comprehensive land use planning, 
have jurisdiction over the remaining 10% of the province’s land area. For the most part, municipal land use 
plans are more restrictive than provincial ones, although in the case of coastal area development, some 
municipalities are actually less restrictive than provided for in provincial legislation. 

Relative sea level estimates for northwest and southwest P.E.I. to year 2100 anticipate a rise of 1.0 to 1.08 m 
± 0.48 m. Estimates for the Charlottetown region predict relative sea level rise of 1.06 m ± 0.48 m.46
Newfoundland and Labrador
POPULATION 514,536 (2011 CENSUS)

Newfoundland and Labrador has almost 29,000 km of coastline.47 The province is divided into the 
mainland territory of Labrador and the southern Island of Newfoundland. The northern coastal region 
of Labrador is ruggedly mountainous with deep fjords and few settlements. The southern coastal region 
of Labrador has a rugged barren foreshore and light to moderate settlement. In Newfoundland, the 
west coast is well-forested coastal plains with several fjord-like bays, the largest of which are the Bay of 
Islands and Bonne Bay. There are almost continuous settlements in the bays and coves along this coast. 
The northeast coast, with its numerous bays, islands and headlands fronts on the Atlantic Ocean from 
the Great Northern Peninsula to the Avalon Peninsula. The shoreline has innumerable bays, coves, islands 
and fjords – it is also an area blocked on an annual basis by arctic drift ice throughout the winter and 
early spring. Settlements have developed along the shores of most bays and on some off-shore islands. 
The south coast has  features typical of a submerged shoreline; namely offshore islands, spits, tombolos48 
and bay-mouth bars (barachoix).49

Over 90% of the population is located in coastal communities, including the capital of St. John’s which is 
home to just over a third of total population.50 Although, sea level rise has been documented throughout 
the province,51 most of the coastline of Newfoundland and Labrador is of moderate to low sensitivity to 
sea level change. In many areas of the province, the presence of relatively steep-sloping bedrock-exposed 
coastlines means sea level rise will have little impact. Notable exceptions to this include the northwest 
coast of the Burin Peninsula and St. George’s Bay as well as specific communities such as Placentia.52 With 
ongoing relative sea level rise, storm surge activity is likely to have a progressively stronger impact on 
higher areas of the shoreline. Areas at greatest risk are sand dominated beaches, coastal dune complexes, 
tidal flats, estuaries and salt marshes.53 

In the Northern Strategic Plan released in 2007, the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador 
recognized the need for a targeted action plan to address climate change in Northern Labrador. In the 2011 
Climate Change Action Plan “Charting Our Course”, the provincial government committed to preparing a 
dedicated strategy on climate change adaptation for Northern Labrador.54 The plan highlights a number 
of climate change adaptation strategies for the province including integrating adaptation considerations 
into public and private sector decision-making, and considering climate change implications in the site 
selection and design of provincial government buildings and infrastructure. 

In June of 2011, the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador released a Coastal and Oceans 
Management Strategy and Policy Framework for public discussion. The need for a provincial coastal 
land use plan was stated, taking into account the principles of sustainable development, climate change 
adaptation, hazard prediction and preparedness, and economic development.55 This document identifies 
that to be proactive in addressing coastal and ocean issues, the Government of Newfoundland and 
Labrador must take a leadership role and engage in meaningful integrated coastal and ocean management 
processes. A key existing provision noted in the document is to maintain a 15 metre shoreline reservation 
or buffer between the shoreline and the boundary of current land titles issued by the Department of 
Environment and Conservation. 

Available data on recent sea level change indicates relative sea level is currently rising across much of 
the Island of Newfoundland, is stable or rising in northern Newfoundland and southern Labrador, and is 
falling in much of central and northern Labrador. For the east coast of Labrador, sea level is estimated to 
rise by 0.80 m to the year 2099. However, for those areas with the greatest concentration of the provincial 
population, the Avalon Peninsula and the west coast, a potential sea level rise of 0.80 to 1.0+ m by 2099 
is anticipated.56

Framework for Decision-Making

Framework for Decision-Making

Communities need adaptation strategies and tools to minimize the long-term economic, environmental 
and social impacts of sea level rise on development in coastal areas. 

Adaptation strategies can be grouped into four broad categories:57

Protect is a reactive strategy to protect people, property and infrastructure from sea level rise and is 
typically the first response considered. Protecting the coastline through structural mechanisms such as 
dikes,58 seawalls and groynes has been the traditional approach to dealing with sea level rise in many parts 
of the world.59 Such measures range from large-scale public projects to small-scale efforts by individual 
property owners. Protection strategies tend to be expensive and may have limited long-term effectiveness 
in highly vulnerable locations.60 

A protect strategy alone creates an expectation that coastal defences will be maintained in perpetuity, which 
may lead to a false sense of security. It may also compound risk by encouraging further development behind 
dikes and other structural protection elements, thereby increasing the number of people and amount of 
property at risk if these fail. Protection strategies are especially attractive if the costs of protection are borne 
by governments at different levels (i.e., if individual property owners bear little or no risk) and if land use is not 
managed with a long term perspective by local governments. 

Communities may use a protect strategy as an interim measure, providing time to implement a retreat 
or avoid strategy; however the strategy should be recognized as a temporary solution and not used to 
encourage further development.

Other forms of protection can take place. There is growing recognition of the benefits of non-structural (soft 
armouring) protection measures, including beach nourishment and coastal wetland restoration and creation. 
These measures can be implemented as sea levels rise, and may complement or supplement structural 
protection. Such non-structural adaptations can enhance the natural resilience of the coastal zone and can be 
less expensive than structural protection, which can lead to unwanted effects on erosion and sedimentation 
patterns if not properly implemented.61

Accommodate is an adaptive strategy that allows continued occupation of coastal areas while changes are 
made to human activities and/or infrastructure to adapt to sea level rise. Accommodation can also involve 
retrofitting a building or making it more resilient to the consequences of sea level rise. Accommodation 
measures for new construction include the use of structural fill to raise the elevation of habitable space, 
restricting building areas subject to flooding to garages, crawl space or other nonhabitable uses, and 
increasing setbacks from watercourses. Strategies such as covenants indemnifying governments from the 
consequences of coastal hazards may also be used to reduce local government liability. 

Retreat (or Managed Retreat) refers to any strategic decision to withdraw, relocate or abandon private 
or public assets at risk due to coastal hazards. Retreat is an adaptive strategy designed to limit the use of 
structural protections, discourage development in areas subject to sea level rise, and plan for the eventual 
relocation of buildings and infrastructure to areas with no risk or a lesser risk. Communities in Prince 
Edward Island have applied this strategy where storms have resulted in significant shoreline loss. 

57  Note: Although these strategies are commonly used, there is considerable variation in their organization and description. Other 

approaches include Preserve, Business as Usual and Attack (based on Land Reclamation).

58  The spelling of dike and dyke (also dikeland and dykeland) are both commonly used in Canada. The term dike is preferred by the 

Government of B.C. and has been used throughout this report except where the spelling of dyke is contained in a legislative reference  
or publication.

Managed retreat is a strategy typically undertaken with a long-term perspective. Small scale managed 
retreat may include site-specific relocation within a property or relocation to another site. Large scale 
relocation may include an entire community. As part of a managed retreat strategy, homes, lighthouses, 
roads and even barns have been moved further inland to protect them from erosion and storm surge. The 
strategy is often used when property owners have enough room on their parcel or when the ongoing costs 
of storm repairs and safety concerns outweigh the costs of retreating. The strategy may also be used to 
provide space for coastal ecosystems to expand or reclaim areas as the sea level rises.62 

Managed retreat is not currently used as frequently as other strategies. There is often a threshold (e.g. 
number of coastal residents or value of properties at risk) above which retreat becomes less likely. Retreat 
from urbanized areas is theoretically possible but politically difficult, and there are few (if any) examples 
of successful and peaceful retreat in densely populated areas. However, it is anticipated that the use of 
managed retreat will increase in the future as the rate of sea level rise increases or the cost of a protect  
or accommodate strategy becomes excessive.

Avoid involves planning so that development does not take place in areas subject to coastal hazards 
associated with sea level rise or where the risk is low at present but will increase over time. This may 
involve identifying future “no build” areas within local government planning documents. A wide range of 
planning tools may be involved in coming to a decision to avoid development in areas subject to moderate 
to high risk. Regulatory tools may include the designation or zoning of lands for limited development or 
nonhabitable uses. An avoid strategy may include land acquisition or restriction tools such as a land trust, 
or the transfer of development potential to areas with low or no risk due to sea level rise.

Business as Usual is not specifically included as a strategy in this Primer but it can be considered as a 
composite of existing strategies. All four adaptation strategies are currently applied to varying degrees 
in different local government jurisdictions throughout coastal Canada. It would be inappropriate to call 
“business as usual” a “do nothing” strategy as there is widespread recognition of coastal risks and the 
application of various tools to address risk. However, the consequences of “business as usual” are not 
neutral as sea level rise will lead to increased vulnerability or require the use of new tools, a different mix 
of tools and higher expenditures. If nothing is done, the consequences of Business as Usual will mean the 
acceptance of additional risk, whether by intention, omission or lack of resources.

An attack strategy refers to options that reclaim land from the sea through dredging, diking, etc. These 
are also referred to as land reclamation, land claim, or “advance the line.” This strategy has seen some 
application in other jurisdictions, particularly in the Netherlands, Hong Kong and Singapore. All these 
locations have small physical coastal land areas and some of the highest population densities in the world. 
In these jurisdictions, some low-lying land has been diked and/or filled to accommodate agriculture, 
port and airport development, and for residential purposes. In the Dutch case, the current use of ocean 
sediment dredged from one location to another represents a form of soft armouring to protect vulnerable 
areas behind dikes.

An attack strategy refers to measures that reclaim land from the sea through dredging, diking and fill. This 
strategy is also referred to as land reclamation, or “advancing the line” and has seen some application in 
other jurisdictions, particularly in the Netherlands, Hong Kong and Singapore. An attack strategy is not 
considered a viable response to sea level rise in Canada. The economic and environmental costs of land 
reclamation, wherever implemented, are extremely high. Instances of land reclamation in Canada take the 
form of soft armouring or hard protection implemented as part of a protect strategy.63 

(Abel, et al. 2011)

62 
63  Local infilling to create or enhance harbours and farmland has historically occurred in Atlantic Canada and in the Lower Mainland of 

British Columbia but is considered to have minimal applicability for the future due to prohibitive costs and environmental impacts.

Sea Level Rise Adaptation Process
Developing and implementing sea level rise adaptation measures at a local level does not begin with the 
implementation of an adaptation tool. Prior to the implementation of any of the adaptation tools discussed 
in this Primer, a process of information gathering, public education and community engagement should be 
undertaken by local community decision makers.64

Through a process of information gathering, including risk and vulnerability assessment, local governments 
will be able to identify their resource limitations and any knowledge gaps. This process may involve building 
internal capacity, identifying champions and establishing a cross-departmental steering committee to 
address sea level rise. After sufficient baseline information has been gathered, public education and 
community engagement should begin. The inclusion of community input at this early stage can help  
foster a sense of ownership and provide valuable information that may otherwise be overlooked. While  
public education and community engagement are shown in Figure 5 as one part of the process, in practice 
they should be included throughout the adaptation process. Establishing community priorities and a 
preferred strategic direction will help narrow down the choice of adaptation tools that may be applicable  
in individual communities. 

Many of the adaptation tools identified in this Primer will require ongoing public input and support to 
be successfully implemented. As the science of estimating sea level rise and its effects evolves, so too will 
adaptation. In order to incorporate new data into the adaptation process and assess the effectiveness of 
adaptations tools already implemented, monitoring and evaluation are required to feed back into the process.

The following provides a brief introduction and some examples of information gathering and engagement. 

64  A community may be undertaking other climate change impacts at the same time.

Information Gathering
Information gathering in the context of this Primer refers to the identification of the potential effects of sea 
level rise, the identification of areas at risk from associated coastal hazards and the assessment of vulnerability. 
This provides a baseline and serves to guide decision makers, stakeholders and the community. Such 
information can be converted and used to spatially depict “coastal hazard zones” or “sea level rise planning 
areas” (see Figure 6 – Sketch of Coastal Hazard Mapping Components).
Mapping environmental constraints and opportunities can demonstrate land sensitivity, including: lands 
vulnerable to sea level rise; increases in tidal surges; changes in low and high tides; increases in coastal and 
riparian flooding; changes in high and low water tables; and impacts on aquatic and terrestrial habitats. 
Before determining possible responses, a discussion of sea level rise should take place. Relevant topics may 
include the following:
•  How will the environment change? 
•  What impacts can be anticipated?
•  What areas are at risk?
•  What is the nature and magnitude

The Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium 
(PCIC) also provides climate services 
and information to users across British 
Columbia. PCIC recognized that climate change impacts do not affect every region of the province in the 
same way and so developed the Plan2Adapt tool. Plan2Adapt generates maps, plots, and data describing 
projected future climate conditions for regions throughout British Columbia. The impacts can be viewed 
by sector – agricultural, infrastructure, hydrology and land use planning – or by impact category – sea level 
rise/storm surge or possible flooding.67

In Quebec, the Ouranos consortium brings together expertise concerning climate change and adaptation 
to provide data for decision makers. Since 2000 they have worked in collaboration with various universities 
to research erosion rates in coastal zones. Additional work identified adaptation strategies for the 
municipalities most at risk from sea level rise. This collaborative research proved instrumental in the 
development of subsequent municipal regulations.

The Government of Newfoundland and Labrador has made a three-year commitment to establish a new 
Coastal Erosion and Mapping Program so that data and reports will be available to all communities for 
planning and development purposes. The New Brunswick District Planning Commissions manage and 
plan for development in their areas and provide advice to the province and municipalities with respect 
to community planning. As an integral part of their mandate, Planning Commissions provide access to 
building inspectors, GIS technicians and a development officer to communities in their regions. In Halifax, 
Nova Scotia, the local government has a current project to develop wave modeling for Halifax Harbour as 
a critical addition to the ongoing development of the Halifax Regional Municipality’s overall adaptive land 
use planning approach.

Fisheries and Oceans Canada – Aquatic Climate Change Adaptation Services  Program 68

In 2011 the Government of Canada committed $16.5 million for implementation of a five-year aquatic 
climate change program called the Aquatic Climate Change Adaptation Services Program. This program 
is funding:

•  Research projects to expand our understanding of how climate change will impact the delivery  

of Fisheries and Ocean’s Canada programs and policies;

•  The development of adaptation tools to enable integration of climate change considerations  

into the delivery of Fisheries and Oceans Canada programs and policies, including work to:
–  Develop high resolution modelling of changes in extreme sea level and ocean waves; 
–  Produce high resolution digital elevation models in intertidal and shallow zones.

68

Public Education and Community Engagement
Public education and engagement help communities to increase their understanding of how communities 
may be directly affected by sea level rise now and in the future. Recent adaptation programs suggest a 
shift towards stakeholder engagement, improved planning tools and governance processes and away 
from technical solutions and physical measures alone.69 A collaborative approach to adaptation offers 
an opportunity to improve public understanding and generate support. Ideally, public education and 
community engagement should take place throughout the adaptation process to ensure transparency  
in the decision-making process. Approaches to engagement may include:

•  Understanding how communities may be directly affected by sea level rise now and in the future  

by applying various tools and approaches, such as visualizations, scenarios and mapping;

•   Making information available from a wide variety of sources;
•   Holding public information seminars, workshops and conferences.

Public education and community engagement are vital components of decision making in a democracy 
and may also be legally required as part of a local planning process. They include addressing key issues 
such as:

•   How much risk is acceptable to a community?
•   How should the risk be managed? 
•   What will the cost be and who will bear it? 

Public education may be challenging. While sea level rise has recently gained increasing attention in 
the public domain, the consequences and the need for adaptation may still be a “hard sell” because the 
time frame is very long and changes will be incremental. This challenge must be recognized and taken 
into consideration when designing public education and community engagement processes. Long term 
residents can play an important role in communicating past extreme events.

Canadian Examples
In British Columbia, the Corporation of Delta partnered with the University of British Columbia’s 
Collaborative for Advanced Landscape Planning (CALP) to develop future sea level rise scenarios using 2D 
and 3D visualisations. The visual materials generated by this project have been used by staff and a citizens’ 
working group to help them understand the impacts, assess the policy implications and measure the social 
acceptability of various adaptation strategies.

In Quebec, following the release of coastal erosion research in the Côte-Nord, over 100 information sharing 
meetings and consultations took place. These meetings played an important role in developing public 
support for new coastal setbacks.

Scenario-Based Planning

Due to the ‘forward looking’ nature of climate change planning and its reliance on climate models to 
estimate future impacts, there is an inherent degree of uncertainty involved in the planning process. 
One popular community engagement approach for addressing and accounting for uncertainties in 
climate predictions is scenario-based planning.

Scenario-based planning will typically begin with the creation of a baseline scenario of current land 
use, management and other stressors. Predicted changes (e.g. expected/proposed development, sea 
level rise and increased storm surge) and possible elements of interest (e.g. ecological and community 
infrastructure features) to these stressors are then modelled to create future scenarios. From these 
scenarios, decision makers can begin to identify thresholds of change – that is, points at which 
significant impacts will be realized and various management options can be ‘tested’ to see which 
maybe most effective.

Several tools have been developed in the United States to help specifically with scenario based 
planning. These include CommunityViz, NatureServe Vista and SLAMM (Sea Level Affecting Marshes 
Model).

Adaptation Tools

Adaptation Tools

The following section provides an analysis of a variety of adaptation tools and their applicability in 
communities on Canada’s southern coasts. In each case, a general description of the tool is given, its 
implementation is discussed, and enabling legislation is noted. In addition, economic, environmental and 
social criteria are discussed, as are the potential barriers or challenges to implementation.   

A total of 21 tools are identified in this Primer. They have been organized into five general categories:

n  Planning tools identified in this Primer consist of local and regional government planning and 

management objectives and policies, mapping of potential hazards, risk management and emergency 
planning.  

n  Regulatory tools include the regulation of subdivision, land use and buildings. These regulatory tools 

require the approval of a decision maker or “gatekeeper” responsible for the protection of the public 
interest. The gatekeeper may consist of the municipal council, regional board or other form of local 
government, building inspector or subdivision approving officer.

n  Land use change or restriction tools focus on land use change or the restriction of land use other 
than through the regulatory functions noted above. Some of these tools are at the disposal of local 
government and others have the potential to achieve local government goals indirectly, for example  
the acquisition of land through a Land Trust.

n  Structural tools (flood protection works) consist of physical structures on land or in water to protect 
land and buildings from coastal hazards. A wide range of hard protection or armouring works fit into 
this category. This grouping can be further broken down into on-site and off-site works, which are also 
referred to as property-specific and linear shoreline protection measures.

n  Non-structural or soft armouring measures include the creation or restoration of wetlands, sand dune 
building or rehabilitation and beach nourishment. Both sand dunes and beaches are naturally occurring 
features, created by the interaction of wind and waves, and serve to dissipate the energy of storm surges 
and wave action.70

Structural and non-structural protection methods are frequently used in combinations called hybrid 
shoreline protection systems. Examples include ‘living shorelines’, which manage coastal erosion by 
protecting, restoring, enhancing or creating natural shoreline habitat that includes the use of structural 
materials in combination with sand, marsh vegetation and other natural planting for shoreline stabilization.

Planning Tools

1. Objectives and Policies

Tool Description
Setting objectives and policies is a key tool available to local governments to manage development. 
Objectives and policies may be included in a wide range of documents, and have different scope and 
applicability depending on the jurisdiction involved and the planning framework in place. Objectives  
and policies may be included in comprehensive plans, community plans, neighbourhood plans, strategic 
plans, and growth management strategies.  

Objectives are often general in nature and may aim to accommodate future development, protect residents, 
manage risk on land subject to hazards, and protect environmentally sensitive areas. 

Policies are often more specific and may identify how coastal hazards such as erosion and inundation 
should be addressed. Policies may include setbacks to avoid coastal areas at risk, environmentally sensitive 
criteria for development or other measures designed to reduce vulnerability and increase resilience.

Application
Objectives and policies may be used as an adaptation tool in every coastal community in Canada. They may 
also be added to existing policy frameworks such as Official Community Plans or Regional Development 
Strategies. 

Setting objectives and policies often enables implementation of other tools. Implementation may be 
achieved through the use of regulatory tools such as a zoning bylaw or development permit. Land 
acquisition, land trust, structural protection and soft armouring all represent means of implementing 
objectives and policies and other planning tools.

Enabling Legislation
The Local Government Act in B.C. requires all Official Community Plans (OCPs) to identify restrictions on the 
use of land that is subject to hazardous conditions (e.g. flooding) or is environmentally sensitive. An OCP 
must include the approximate location and phasing of roads, sewers and water systems. This may identify 
infrastructure at risk and enable adaptations.

The Local Government Act also allows for development of regional growth strategies. Only ten of 29 regional 
districts have adopted regional growth strategies, however all coastal areas in B.C. with large populations 
are now covered. Regional growth strategies guide decisions on growth, change, and development. They 
cover a period of at least 20 years and include a comprehensive statement on the future of the region and 
social, economic and environmental objectives. Objectives deal with developing settlement patterns that 
minimize risks associated with natural hazards and protect environmentally sensitive areas.

30

Planning ToolsQuébec’s policy for the protection of riverbeds, shorelines, coastlines and floodplains sets uniform setbacks 
based on grade and requires that a permit be obtained for new construction near shorelines. The policy also 
bans all construction directly on the coastline. Regional County Municipalities (RCMs) were encouraged to 
integrate measures for coastal protection, as outlined in the policy, within their regional master plans  
(Schema d’aménagement). As of 2012 all but seven of the 86 RCMs had adopted measures.71

New Brunswick’s Coastal Areas Protection Policy establishes setbacks for permanent structures. This policy, 
which came into force in 2002, divided coastal areas into three sensitivity zones: 
•  Zone A – the areas closest to the water (known as the coastal lands core area) including dunes, beaches, 

wetlands, dikelands and tidal flats;

•  Zone B – a 30 m area landward of Zone A designed to limit activity and provide a development buffer, and 
•  Zone C – the areas beyond Zone B that form a transition from coastal to inland areas. 

This policy is enforced through provincial environmental impact assessment legislation. Provincial legislation 
also provides municipalities with the ability to incorporate these policies into their own requirements.

New Brunswick also has Watercourse and Wetland Alteration Regulations, which limit activities that take 
place within or close to a watercourse or wetland. A permit is required before certain activities can take 
place within 30 metres of a watercourse.

Prince Edward Island has adopted shoreline setback regulations for subdivision and development under 
the Provincial Planning Act. The province uses setbacks based on historical data, but is currently updating 
setbacks using with aerial photos of coastlines. Under the Environmental Protection Act, P.E.I. also requires 
that a watercourse, wetland and buffer zone activity permit be obtained for any temporary or permanent 
change made to or near a watercourse or wetland. A permit is required for all such alterations made within  
15 metres (49.2 feet) of any watercourse (including a coastal water body) or wetland boundary. 

In Newfoundland and Labrador, the 1990 Urban and Rural Planning Act makes provision for regional and 
municipal planning including the setting of plan objectives and policies. There are 281 municipalities in 
the province of Newfoundland and Labrador and about half of these have municipal plans; however many 
are outdated. The Department of Environment has a “Policy for Development in Shore Water Zones”. This 
policy establishes criteria for issuing permits under the Water Resources Act, for all development activities in 
and affecting shore water zones. In marine situations, the high water level of a water body must allow for 
maximum waves, wind setup, storm surge and ultimate mean sea levels under global climatic forecasts for 
a 1:100 year design. 

Evaluation and Governance Considerations 
Economic – Economic considerations include the cost of developing and setting objectives and policies 
and the cost of implementing them. The cost to undertake the process is easily measurable while the cost 
of implementation is much more difficult to assess. 

There are also economic costs if no objectives and policies are set. Economic obligations associated with  
development in hazardous areas may increase (e.g., development in areas at risk of coastal hazards  
with no protection measures). 

Environmental – Development restrictions in environmentally sensitive areas and areas subject to coastal 
hazards have long been addressed through municipal planning objectives and policies. Incorporating 
adaptation to sea level rise into these objectives and policies is a logical next step. 

71 

(Martel 2012)

31

Planning ToolsSocial – Objectives and policies will need to complement other planning measures designed to manage 
residential growth and other forms of development, recreation and open space needs, community facilities 
and other infrastructure needs. 

The successful implementation of new objectives and policies often depends on a strong public education 
and consultation process as they are developed.

Implementation Measures and Challenges 
Challenges include the time and resources required for public consultation and education. In a regional 
goal-setting process such as a regional growth strategy, a mediation or arbitration process among the 
different municipal governments may be required in order to achieve agreement. 

In implementing policies and objectives, it is important to differentiate binding and non-binding measures. 
For example, the City of Vancouver increased Flood Construction Levels by an additional 1.0 m in January 
2012 as a recommended but non-binding measure to address increased risk due to sea level rise. This is 
expected to be followed by a mandatory requirement following further review and technical study. 

Advantages

Disadvantages

Research and policy development in adapting to sea level 
rise may be time consuming and require a commitment 
of staff and financial resources. 
The addition of policies to address sea level rise may add 
controversy, particularly ‘Avoid’ or ’ Retreat’ strategies.

There is an established history of setting objectives and 
policies through a co-ordinated and comprehensive 
approach to land use planning and growth management 
in response to coastal hazards.
The planning process provides opportunities for public 
involvement and education. 
The degree to which objectives are met and policies 
implemented can be measured and monitored over time.

2. Coastal Hazard Mapping

Tool Description
Coastal hazard maps identify areas susceptible to coastal hazards and the effects of sea level 
rise. Mapping provides the technical basis for land use planning in coastal areas and enables the 
development of floodplain bylaws. 

The mapping of coastal areas at risk of flooding or erosion is a vital tool for land use planning. Projected 
future sea levels can then be superimposed on a topographic map of coastal hazards to identify new areas 
subject to hazards. 

A recent report commissioned by the B.C. government identified four steps to develop coastal floodplain 
maps. These were: 
•  Acquisition of detailed floodplain topography
•  An engineering analysis of water level components and associated flood construction levels
•  Preparation of floodplain maps indicating the areas subject to flood hazards and the magnitude of  

these hazards, and 

•  The preparation of a brief documenting the process.

32

Planning ToolsThe report also suggested that coastal floodplain maps contain the following elements:
•  Flood Construction Levels (FCLs) to the years 2100 and 2200; 
•  Floodplain limits to 2100 and 2200; 
•  Sea level rise planning areas for 2100 and 2200; and 
•  Tsunami evacuation planning areas (if applicable).72

Coastal flood hazards are determined by the interaction of storm surges and waves with seabed 
bathymetry and coastal land cover. To effectively map the extent of coastal hazards, accurate topographic 
data is required, ideally with a contour interval of 1 m or less. The traditional method is to conduct field 
surveys of the topography. However, LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data, collected from an aircraft 
using a laser, is increasingly being used. 

LiDAR offers both an accurate and economical means of topographic mapping, particularly where large 
surface areas are involved. The set of elevation points generated by a LiDAR survey can be brought into a 
geographical information system (GIS) and used to build surfaces that represent the earth’s topography 
with great precision. This provides an ideal base map which can be used to determine coastal hazard risk.73 

Ground surveys provide the highest accuracy; however, to cover an entire coastline using this method may 
be impractical and prohibitively expensive. Ground surveys may be used to supplement or monitor the 
accuracy of the results received from LiDAR or other technologies. 

Ground surveys are still required to establish ground and floodproof elevations at a specific site where  
the FCL has been derived from a floodplain map. Floodplain map topography should not be relied upon  
to establish specific building elevations.74

An engineering analysis is then used to map areas at risk. A review of long-term water level records is a key 
resource in assessing historic coastal flood levels and return periods. For coastal areas, these records are 
collected by tide gauges, operated by the Canadian Hydrographic Service (CHS) of the Department  
of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO). Coastal water level records are available on the DFO website.75 Hazard maps 
typically show the physical boundaries of areas and what the hazard risks are based on risk analysis factors 
such as a design flood. With sea level rise, hazard mapping will not only need to incorporate the increase 
in water levels, but the effects of storm surge, wind and tides, in various combinations. These will vary 
depending on the local climatic conditions. 

In recent years there has been a lack of sea ice during the winter months in several coastal areas of Atlantic 
Canada. This lack of sea ice must also be documented as a coastal hazard. The ice has historically provided a 
buffer for the coastline, but with reduced quantities, wave energy now often reaches the shoreline and hits 
exposed cliffs, glacial deposits, sand dunes, sand spits, barrier bars, marshes, shoreline protection systems 
and other coastal features. The P.E.I. National Park has been monitoring “ice foot”76 in recent years as they 
have observed significant damage to the park shoreline and dune systems after storm surges during  
winter months.

Planning ToolsApplication
Coastal hazard mapping may be used to identify areas at risk due to the adverse effects of sea level rise, 
direct new development away from these high risk areas and manage development in areas where the risk 
is minimal or can be mitigated. Coastal hazard mapping complements and strengthens other adaptation 
options and increases stakeholder awareness of areas at risk. As such, this tool may be applied to all coastal 
areas at risk of coastal hazards, irrespective of the other adaptation tools implemented. 

In 1975 the federal government of Canada initiated the Flood Damage Reduction Program. Under this 
program, mapping of floodplain regions was supported through a 50/50 cost shared basis with provinces. 
Through this program over 700 communities in six provinces undertook flood hazard mapping – of which a 
majority were in Quebec. At a minimum, maps were required to identify areas subject to 1 in 100 year flood 
events. B.C. adopted a design flood standard of 1 in 200 years, except on the Fraser River, where the 1948 
flood of record was used. Atlantic Canada and Quebec adopted a flood standard of 1 in 100 years. Mapping 
under this program was completed by 2000.

Since 2000, coastal hazard mapping has progressed sporadically across the country. As part of the Atlantic 
Regional Adaptation Collaborative, digital elevation mapping was completed for some coastal areas of 
Nova Scotia, including the Chignecto Isthmus, where an evaluation of flood risk to infrastructure was 
undertaken. 

The Halifax Regional Municipality in collaboration with Natural Resources Canada has conducted flood 
hazard mapping, including extreme event data. The results are reported in Halifax Harbour Extreme Water 
Levels in the Context of Climate Change, Scenarios for a 100-year Planning Horizon Geological Survey of 
Canada. This report includes an understanding of present and future sea level rise, vertical land motion, 
extreme water levels (combined tide and surge), harbour seiche and wave run-up.

The Province of New Brunswick maintains a coastal erosion database, which presents long-term coastline 
and shoreline migration rates. This data is generated through photogrammetric studies (air photos 
analyses) conducted by N.B. Department of Natural Resources and collaborators (universities, colleges, 
NGOs, consultants, etc.). This data is used to determine appropriate setbacks when new developments are 
being assessed in coastal areas. 

In B.C. current federal-provincial flood management programs do not cover updates to hazard mapping or 
hydraulic analysis, although both have been included as secondary components in some projects. 

In Prince Edward Island a 30 cm rise has been observed at the Charlottetown tide gauge since 1900. 
Climate change scenarios suggest that a sea level rise of 100 cm can be anticipated by 2100 with storm 
surges likely to become more frequent and more intense. To identify vulnerable infrastructure and guide 
land use planning, hazard mapping has been undertaken across the province.

Planning ToolsEvaluation and Governance Considerations 
Economic – Developing hazard maps requires a commitment of both technical resources and funding.  
This may include resources for:
•  Engineering expertise in flood risk modelling; 
•  Topographic surveys (LiDAR or remote sensing) to provide information on land elevation, which will 

feed back into the flood risk model;

•  Costs of collecting extreme event data such as water levels, wave heights, etc. where this information  

is available;

•  Cost of employing a Geographic Information System (GIS) specialist; and
•  Cost of adding a coastal hazard layer or updating hazard information. 

The economic impacts of the maps themselves depends on a wide variety of factors, including how they 
are presented and distributed as well as how they are applied to planning and outreach activities. 

Environmental – Coastal hazard mapping may incorporate environmental data such as coastal habitats  
at risk or sensitive ecosystems and enable better environmental protection for areas at risk.

Social – Hazard maps identify housing, roads, underground services, and community resources subject 
to coastal hazards, allowing for more informed planning and emergency management decisions. Hazard 
maps also enable public education and action, however, if a community is unaware of the benefits of 
coastal hazard mapping, they may prefer to see public money spent on more tangible flood and erosion 
protection measures.

Implementation Measures and Challenges 
Coastal hazard maps have a wide variety of applications. GIS based mapping enables the detailed 
calculation of land areas at risk, property values and building values as well as the identification of strategic 
assets. These economic calculations can also provide the basis for better understanding the social and 
environmental considerations affecting vulnerable areas. 

Maps have long been used to support planning and development. In order for coastal hazard maps to 
effectively reduce future coastal hazard risk and facilitate sustainable development, the consideration of 
hazard maps must be integrated into planning procedures and periodically updated.

The required expertise and modelling capacity may not be locally available, especially in smaller local 
governments. In addition, coastal hazards often cross jurisdictional boundaries. To pool limited resources 
and address trans-boundary impacts, work at a regional scale – with support from various levels of 
government – is often the most effective approach to hazard mapping. 

35

Planning ToolsAdvantages

Disadvantages

There is a history of using hazard maps to support 
planning and development policies by identifying high 
risk locations and steering development away from these 
areas. 
The identification of new or emerging risk areas helps 
with effective emergency response plans. It is essential 
that certain infrastructure, such as electricity supplies, 
sewage treatment, and services, such as the emergency 
services, continue to function during a hazard event. The 
creation of hazard maps allows communities to locate 
these elements in low risk areas. Alternatively, mapping 
may highlight a requirement to defend these elements 
from coastal hazards. 
Coastal hazard mapping can quantify what is at risk (e.g. 
the number of houses or businesses). This can assist in 
managing risk by helping set priorities and determining 
the most suitable strategy. 
The creation of coastal hazard mapping promotes 
greater awareness of the risks of sea level rise. This can 
be beneficial in encouraging hazard zone residents to 
prepare for the occurrence of flooding.
By identifying buildings at risk of flooding, awareness 
raising campaigns can also be targeted at high risk 
properties. 

3. Risk Management

In itself, new coastal hazard mapping will not cause 
a reduction in risk nor address sea level rise. The 
information must be integrated into other regulatory, 
land use change, and structural and non-structural tools 
before the full benefits can be realised.
To realise the full benefits of coastal hazard mapping, it 
is important to provide people in the areas at risk with 
information about emergency procedures and ways of 
reducing risk. If information on what to do in the event  
of an emergency is not provided, coastal hazard maps 
may serve to increase fear and anxiety, as residents are 
more aware of the risks.
The collection of topographic and bathymetric data 
to complement extreme water level and wave height 
information could be expensive.
Due to the lack of observed extreme event data, more 
advanced, accurate coastal hazard maps are likely to rely 
on complex numerical models. This requires a degree of 
expertise to implement.
Coastal hazard maps need to be updated periodically  
to reflect changing climate and other factors.

Tool Description
Risk management is a process widely used to identify and manage the adverse impacts of a change in 
conditions. The magnitude of a risk is calculated by examining the probability of the occurrence of an 
event and the severity of its impact.77 Risk management with respect to sea level rise and associated coastal 
hazards generally has two components. The first involves the identification, assessment, measurement,  
and prioritization of risks from sea level rise (risk assessment). The second involves selecting and 
implementing management measures. The measurement process may be quantitative, such as calculating 
the probability of a flood in excess of current linear protection, or it may be qualitative, documenting 
increasing vulnerability and reduced resilience. Coastal hazards due to sea level rise may include the risk  
of a major disaster such as a dike failure as well as risks from gradual changes such as increasing salinization 
of groundwater. 

A risk assessment may have aspects that affect people, the environment and the economy. Risk 
management methodologies can also provide a way to explore public attitudes and perceptions of risk – 
information which can be fed back into the assessment.78 The setting of priorities reflects the importance  
of the coastal hazard and leads to a discussion on how those risks should be managed.

Planning ToolsApplication
Sea level rise has been identified as a risk in the academic literature for at least two decades. The design of sea 
level rise risk-management strategies relies on sea level rise projections, which are constantly being revised 
based on new data and research. Risks due to sea level rise have increased in recent years due to various 
aspects of climate change, including the more rapid melting of glaciers, higher water and atmospheric 
temperature readings around the globe and more intense storm activity. As noted previously, considerable 
regional variation in sea level rise will take place. 

With sea level rise, increased protection measures will be required just to maintain the same level of 
protection (i.e., 1:100 years or 1:200 years) that has been historically provided. When the Canadian Flood 
Damage Reduction Program was created in 1975, minimum federal standards with respect to acceptable 
flood risk were set at a 1 in 100 year flood. Should a higher level of protection be called for, additional 
measures will be required. Whether the standard of protection remains the same or is increased, other 
approaches to risk management may be required. These may include tools such as land acquisition, land 
trust, covenant or easement and soft armouring to reduce impact. 

Enabling Legislation
A risk assessment does not require specific enabling legislation. It can occur in the preparation of an Official 
Community Plan or other planning process as authorized by provincial legislation. Risk management may 
also be undertaken as part of an emergency planning and preparedness initiative. For example, In Québec, 
the 2001 Loi sur la sécurité civile (Law on civil security), Chapter IV, Section III obliges municipal officials to 
publicly communicate all known major risks and develop regulations for risk management.

Evaluation and Governance Considerations
Economic – Risk management involves a rigorous process of comparing and selecting the most 
appropriate risk reduction measures. It can also include an analysis of the cost of “doing nothing.” A cost-
benefit analysis – used to determine how well, or how poorly, a planned action will turn out – can assist 
the risk management process. A cost benefit analysis is most commonly undertaken where the costs and 
benefits can be quantified in financial terms, to enable comparability. It relies on the addition of positive 
factors and the subtraction of negative ones to determine a net result.

37

Planning ToolsThe two main applications of a cost-benefit analysis for risk management with respect to coastal hazards 
are: 
•  To determine if the proposed action is a sound financial decision. (Can it be justified? Is the proposed 

action feasible?)

•  To provide a basis for comparing possible projects (e.g., dike vs. seawall + beach nourishment). This 

involves comparing the total expected cost of each option against the total expected benefits, to see  
if the benefits outweigh the costs, and by how much.

A ‘multiple account’ cost-benefit analysis recognizes that all values are complex and that not all consequences 
can be expressed in monetary terms or incorporated into one summary measure of net benefit. 

Environmental – Risk management may be used to reduce sea level rise risks to environmental assets and 
species at risk. The protection of wetlands is of particular importance due to historic losses, as are intertidal 
areas, due to their high productivity.

Social – Social criteria is embedded into most risk management processes. Assessments identify acceptable 
risk levels, community assets needing protection, and when or if a different strategy should be adopted 
to respond to the long-term consequences of sea level rise. The experience of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 
demonstrated the extreme vulnerability of persons lacking mobility, particularly those with low income 
and the residents of nursing homes.

Implementation Measures and Challenges 
Implementation of risk management measures depends on the overall strategy adopted and the tool 
or combination of tools selected to manage identified risk within acceptable levels. Challenges include 
selecting an acceptable level of risk, selecting the most appropriate tools to manage the risk, and 
committing the capital and maintenance costs required to implement the risk management plan.

Advantages

Disadvantages

A long-term perspective is often required to manage 
risks to large scale linear infrastructure. Risk management 
allows for a phased or cumulative risk management 
approach.
Risk management may involve a rigorous, defensible 
analytic approach with reliable information used to  
support decision making.
Risk management can be an essential tool to help 
determine the most appropriate response to coastal 
hazards.

There may be a significant cost. However, the cost  
must be measured against the risk.
The absence of detailed studies may impede some 
initiatives but should not prevent the use of interim 
measures to reduce risk (e.g. minimum setback and 
elevation from the natural boundary or other potential 
risk). 

38

Planning Tools4. Emergency Planning and Preparedness

Tool Description
Emergency planning and preparedness measures are undertaken in advance of a disaster. Coastal flooding 
may result in property damage, damage to or destruction of property contents, economic losses due to 
severed transportation links and other damaged infrastructure. It may also result in loss of land due to 
erosion, business disruption in the affected area, population/community displacement, health and safety 
hazards and even death. Effective emergency planning and preparedness reduces the damage caused by 
such events. 

Post-disaster management refers to measures undertaken during and after a disaster and are discussed 
separately following the discussion of adaptation tools.

Application
Emergency planning and preparedness measures may be undertaken in all coastal areas at risk of coastal 
hazards, irrespective of the other adaptation tools implemented. 

Between 1970 and 2013, the federal government administered the Joint Emergency Preparedness Program 
(JEPP) to support disaster preparedness through funds provided to provincial and territorial governments. 
This program provided financial assistance of up to 75% of a specific project to a maximum of $3,000,000, 
and focused specifically on increasing local government emergency response capability.

In B.C., under the Emergency Program Act, local authorities have primary responsibility for responding to 
emergencies and must have an emergency plan in place to address potential flood events and maintain 
public safety. The Province provides support to local authorities depending on the magnitude of the event.

Local authorities:
•  must prepare a local Emergency Plan;
•  must establish and maintain an Emergency Management Organization;
•  may cause the plan to be implemented;
•  may declare a state of local emergency; and
•  may do all acts and implement all procedures that it considers necessary to prevent, respond to or 

alleviate the effects of an emergency or disaster.

The emergency management of floods consists of several phases. This tool covers the first phase – 
emergency planning and preparedness for a flood. Later phases concern flood response and recovery/
disaster financial assistance. These later phases are critically important but are not considered part of the 
Primer toolkit.

In 1999, to assist local and diking authorities to prepare a flood response plan, the B.C. Water Management 
Branch and the Provincial Emergency Program (PEP) published the Flood Planning and Response Guide 
for British Columbia.79 This document includes sections on flood prevention, flood damage prevention, the 
preparation and implementation of a flood response plan and post flood management.

79  The Guide also provides assistance for preparation of a Flood Response Plan. More detail is available at  

http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/wsd/public_safety/flood/fhm-2012/flood_emg_response.html. 

39

Planning ToolsEmergency Management B.C. stresses the importance of volunteers in dealing with emergencies of various 
types, including floods. People are encouraged to establish Neighbourhood Emergency Preparedness 
Programs to help individuals and neighbours prepare to be self-sufficient for an extended period. 
Volunteers are also important in the implementation of emergency response plans.

In Nova Scotia, under the Emergency Management Act, each municipality is required to establish and 
maintain an emergency measures bylaw, an emergency measures organization with an appointed 
coordinator, establish an advisory committee consisting of members of the municipal council and prepare 
and approve an emergency measures plan.80 Similar provisions are in place in New Brunswick and Prince 
Edward Island. 

In P.E.I. the Office of Public Safety assists communities in upgrading their existing emergency response 
plans. Their municipal emergency management guide outlines key components and steps to help 
communities to develop plans, create exercises and ensure resources have been identified before an 
emergency occurs. A municipal self-assessment tool helps municipalities identify key areas of focus and 
to ensure hazards are clearly understood. Emergency planning templates are available for municipalities 
and local businesses to create an emergency plan specific to the community or business requirements and 
emergency training is offered to individuals and organizations that have a role to play in an emergency. 

Evaluation and Governance Considerations
Economic – Economic considerations include the cost and resources of preparing emergency plans, 
co-ordinating with other agencies and obtaining resources for plan implementation. Input in the form of 
assistance – technical and monetary – for the preparation of emergency plans or planning may come from 
higher government departments, agencies, and NGOs.81

Environmental – This tool is not intended to address environmental issues.

Social – The primary objective of this tool is the protection of human life, followed by the maintenance 
of essential services and the protection of infrastructure and buildings. This tool lays the groundwork to 
prepare for a possible emergency and undertake planning measures including the evacuation of an area  
to protect human life. 

Implementation Measures and Challenges 
Challenges include securing adequate resources, updating plans and undertaking disaster simulation 
exercises. Staff training is essential and “dry runs” are highly desirable to test the plans and response 
coordination. This requires resources and commitment from dedicated personnel and the coordination  
of multiple stakeholders.

Advantages

Disadvantages

The quality and effectiveness of emergency management 
plans may vary depending on the level of interest and 
resources allocated.
The plans must be updated regularly to remain current.
The monitoring and enforcement of emergency response 
plans require time and resources.

Local governments have the authority to prepare 
emergency management plans for a wide range  
of risks. Sea level rise represents one additional risk  
to be addressed.
The local government has the authority to declare a local 
emergency, which may be due to sea level rise.
Emergency planning demonstrates that hazards are real, 
particularly when public education is included with the 
planning process.
Emergency management starts from the ground up and 
involves teamwork with other agencies and the Province.

Planning ToolsRegulatory Tools

1. Regulation of Land Use

Tool Description
Land use can be regulated through neighbourhood plans, character guidelines, capital works plans, 
strategic plans, growth management plans and setback regulations. Land use can also be regulated 
through the establishment of appropriate zoning within areas subject to or potentially subject to coastal 
hazards. Zoning can regulate a wide range of activities, including restrictions on land uses, land use 
densities, setbacks, siting circumstances and servicing standards.

Application
Land use regulation – especially zoning – is a tool available in all provinces, although the specific scope 
of regulation ranges from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The three key elements of land use regulation 
pertaining to sea level rise and coastal hazards consist of minimum building setbacks from coastal hazards 
or structural protection from coastal hazards, minimum elevation of buildings in relation to flood risk, and 
restrictions on land use. This tool can also be used to create new composite zones, such as a Sea Level Rise 
Planning Areas.

Enabling Legislation
In B.C., under Section 903 of the Local Government Act, a local government may by bylaw divide the whole 
or part of the municipality or regional district into zones, name each zone, establish their boundaries 
and regulate the use of land, siting and density of buildings and other structures within each one. This 
legislation could be used to create new zones with respect to coastal areas and enable a local government 
to regulate the use of land.

In B.C., provincial guidelines82 call for new construction containing habitable space to be located above 
the historical 1 in 200 year flood event plus an additional safety margin (called freeboard) to deal with 
uncertainty. The resulting elevation is called the Flood Construction Level (FCL). Section 910 of the Local 
Government Act allows a local government to designate as a flood plain, by bylaw, any area where it 
considers that flooding may occur on land. When an area is designated as a flood plain, the bylaw may 
specify setbacks – based on the provincial guidelines – from the water or a dike and what structural 
support is required to elevate a floor system (or mobile home pad) above the flood level. 

Other provinces have similar land use regulations. Zoning restrictions, minimum setbacks, lot grading, 
minimum building elevations and erosion protection are all commonly used to mitigate hazard risks. 

In Quebec, provincial setback lines differ based on regional variations and available data on erosion rates. 
Most of the coastal areas require a 10–15 metre setback for the protection of the shorelines as established 
by provincial policy in 1987. From 2000 to 2004 a group of five ministries conducted precise erosion 
rate research in the Côte-Nord region. From this research setbacks of between 60 and 160 metres were 
suggested for that region, depending upon the rate of erosion. However, these suggested setbacks were 
not set as policy and therefore not widely adopted as regulation. In 2011, a uniform 30-metre setback 
for all other coastal communities was proposed. Many municipalities, however, have requested similar 
research and detailed erosion maps as were completed for the Côte-Nord to ensure they have irrefutable 
data in the face of potential legal challenges by coastal property owners. The Province is in the process of 
commissioning detailed studies on erosion and subsidence rates in order to develop up-to-date precision 
maps for all the shorelines of Quebec. Studies are being completed one area at a time in order of priority 
related to vulnerability.83

Regulatory ToolsSetbacks in Îles-de-la-Madeleine

Updated maps for the municipality of Îles-de-la-Madeleine were completed in late 2012 by UQAR on 
commission by the province. Once all the data has been translated into a directive by the province to 
the municipality, it has 120 days to integrate the new setback rules into its master plans, as per the loi 
sur l’aménagement et l’urbanisme (Planning and Urban Planning Law), article 56.14.84

The municipality of Îles-de-la-Madeleine is one of the most vulnerable areas of Quebec. Zoning 
regulations adopted in 2010 increased the setback from 15 to 30 metres. Although a provincial 
directive was not issued, this increase occurred as a result of public consultation and multi-stakeholder 
research on sea level rise in Îles-de-la-Madeleine, undertaken by the Ouranos Consortium. 

84

In New Brunswick, the Community Planning Act has a provision for municipalities and rural communities to 
enact a flood risk area bylaw with provincial approval. Once such an area has been established, the bylaw 
can specify engineering standards, designs and techniques for development in flood risk areas. This Act 
also allows for land use planning throughout the province and allows for the creation of District Planning 
Commissions. These Commissions are responsible for providing building, development and planning 
services to municipalities and unincorporated areas of the province.

Cap Bimet, Grand 
Barachois, N.B.

In Nova Scotia, the Province has designated land use or zoning powers to the municipalities through the 
Municipal Government Act and the Halifax Regional Municipality Charter. These powers allow municipalities 
to develop planning strategies and bylaws to regulate land use.85 

In P.E.I, zoning and development bylaws have been enacted in a number of coastal municipalities, 
pursuant to the Planning Act Subdivision and Development Regulations. These municipalities must follow 
the provisions of the Environmental Protection Act Watercourse and Wetland Protection Regulations, under 
provincial legislation. Municipalities can alter the setback requirements specified in the Planning Act 
Subdivision and Development Regulations for setbacks from coastal areas and beaches.

Regulatory ToolsIn Newfoundland and Labrador, responsibility for land use planning is shared by the provincial, federal, 
municipal, Innu Nation and Nunatsiavut governments. The Department of Municipal Affairs generally 
focuses on communities, although the Urban and Rural Planning Act provides a broader mandate that 
includes regional planning, the setting of plan objectives and policies, zoning and implementation 
measures. The Department of Environment and Conservation oversees ownership and use of the seabed 
within harbours and bays in the province and reviews all applications for land use to ensure compliance 
with existing regulations and policies.

The Department’s Policy for Development in Shore Water Zones establishes criteria for issuing permits for all 
development activities in and affecting shore water zones.86 This policy does not permit infilling, drainage, 
dredging, channelization, or removal of surface or underwater vegetation on or along shore water zones 
which could aggravate flooding problems. Shoreline activities on crown land are covered by provincial 
rules, though some municipalities do have development guidelines that restrict what can happen in 
the buffer zone. All individuals applying for unencumbered Crown land in Newfoundland and Labrador 
must maintain a 15 metre buffer zone between the shoreline and the boundary of the issued title though 
there is a reduction to 10 metres for residential lots and some older land grants are exempt. As in other 
provincial jurisdictions, municipalities and regional planning authorities can implement measures under 
their own plans and bylaws to protect coastal areas from sea level rise, flooding, erosion or other hazards. 
Newfoundland and Labrador has two regional planning authorities responsible for planning issues in their 
respective areas. As an example, the regional planning authority for Corner Brook – Humber Valley has 
included climate change adaptation as an issues to consider in their planning process.87

Evaluation and Governance Considerations
Economic – Land use restrictions, by their nature, confer development rights, with different rights for 
different zones and areas. While these restrictions have significant economic implications, they may be 
introduced in the public interest, for example, to meet changing community needs and manage competing 
interests and conflict.

Environmental – Regulation may facilitate identification and protection of environmentally sensitive areas 
and manage environmental hazards.

Social – Regulation and zoning must be balanced to accommodate future population needs, while 
protecting infrastructure from hazards and locating essential services in low risk areas.

Implementation Measures and Challenges 
Implementation measures include the adoption of a zoning bylaw or other land use regulation by a local 
government. Challenges include having the information resources or capabilities to identify areas at risk 
and the degree of risk to be addressed. Related tools include topographic mapping to identify the location 
of areas at risk, and engineering expertise to address appropriate protection or adaptation measures 
needed to avoid the risk or reduce the risk to acceptable levels. Technical requirements to address coastal 
flood risks may be expensive. Public acceptance may also pose a challenge.

There may be challenges in cases where there is conflicting information on appropriate land use 
restrictions. For example, in Quebec, Côte-Nord established a setback line using the probability of a  
1-in-100 year flood event. This conflicted with previous proposal to establish setbacks using the probability 
of a 1-in-25 year flood event. This situation has resulted in potential grounds for legal challenges.

86  A shore water zone means the land that is intermittently occupied by water as a result of the naturally fluctuating surface water level in 
a body of water which can be either a fresh or salt water body and, in either case, the low water mark and high water mark of the water 
body defining the edges of the shore water zone. 

87  See draft Humber Valley Regional Land Use Plan 2011-12.

43

Regulatory ToolsAdvantages

Disadvantages

Zoning or floodplain related bylaws allow the restriction 
of land uses based on identified risks within a specified 
area (e.g., floodplain).
Zoning gives a local government great flexibility in 
addressing different conditions and needs within its 
physical boundaries.
Zoning is well suited to public education and 
involvement.

Local government may not be able to impose zoning that 
will render the land sterile (i.e., unable to be used) but it 
can restrict the way in which land and buildings are used 
so that risks can be addressed.
Technical supporting documentation to address 
coastal flood risks may be expensive (e.g., floodplain 
mapping, design briefs, updated flood risk assessment, 
implementation measures to adapt to or reduce  
flood risk).
Interim measures may lack technical documentation 
but can be undertaken at modest cost (e.g. sea level rise 
study area).

2. Subdivision Regulation

Tool Description
Subdivision regulation can be used to prevent or establish conditions for the subdivision of land at risk 
from coastal hazards associated with sea level rise. A proposed subdivision must go through a review 
process, which culminates in the approval (including approval with conditions) or refusal of the proposed 
subdivision by the Approving Officer or other appointed official. A subdivision refers to establishing a 
separate title of land. This can include a simple property, bare land strata lot, or strata unit (e.g., townhouse, 
row house, or condominium unit in an apartment building).

Application
This tool applies to the subdivision of land at risk of coastal hazards due to sea level rise and can be utilized 
in conjunction with zoning. 

Enabling Legislation
In most regions across Canada, subdivision decisions are governed by some form of an approving officer. 
The nomenclature used to identify this approving officer, their specific role and level of government where 
the position is located varies in Quebec and Atlantic Canada but their basic “gatekeeper” function is similar.

In B.C., the subdivision of land is an administrative responsibility given to an Approving Officer and is 
separate from the responsibility of an elected Council or Board. An Approving Officer appointed by a 
municipality is typically the Municipal Engineer or Chief Planning Officer. For small municipalities, the 
Approving Officer may be the Chief Administrative Officer or a person contracted to undertake that 
responsibility. In non-municipal areas of regional districts, the Approving Officer is an employee of the 
Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure. 

Under Section 86 of the Land Title Act, an Approving Officer may refuse to approve a plan for subdivision 
if the land is subject to, or could reasonably be expected to be subject to, hazards such as flooding and/or 
erosion. A subdivision can also be refused if the cost to government of providing public utilities or other 
works and services would be excessive or if the subdivision would adversely affect the natural environment.

Section 86 also allows the Approving Officer to require a report by a qualified professional that the land 
may be used safely. Under Section 219 of the B.C. Land Title Act, the report is included in a covenant and 
registered as a charge on title and remains on the title of any parcels created by the subdivision, regardless 
of future ownership. 

44

Regulatory ToolsVariations occur in other provinces. Some but not all Nova Scotia municipalities have Municipal Planning 
Strategies or bylaws to regulate zoning and subdivision in place. Municipalities or non-incorporated areas 
must still comply with the provincial Subdivision Regulations under the Municipal Government Act and the 
Environmental Protection Act in Nova Scotia. 

In P.E.I. the Environmental Protection Act requires an environmental impact assessment for undertakings which 
could have a significant effect on the environment including an effect on any unique, rare or endangered 
feature of the environment, or an effect which causes public concern. This legislation has broad application and 
includes specific references to the alteration of wetlands, interfering with the movement of sand on a beach 
or sand dune, and the destruction of natural stabilizing features such as vegetation. As a result, subdivision 
applications are reviewed through the provincial Environmental Impact Assessment process prior to issuing 
development permits. N.B., N.S. and N.L. all have similar environmental provisions in place.

Evaluation and Governance Considerations
Economic – Economic considerations include the cost of allowing or avoiding development in an area 
subject to coastal hazards, the cost of providing flood protection, and the cost of adapting to the risk. In the 
event of a flood, or if the risk increases and increased structural protection is required (e.g. increased dike 
height), these costs may be borne by different levels of government.

Environmental – Environmental considerations involve the effect on the natural environment of the 
subdivision due to sea level rise and coastal hazards. Subdivision regulation can be used to address 
environmental issues such as suitability of land use and development impact.

Social – Various public stakeholders and potential land owners may be affected by the approval or 
refusal to approve a subdivision. An Official Community Plan or a similar guiding document may provide 
a framework for these decisions and provide guidance on the suitability of subdivision development; 
particularly for residential use.

Implementation Measures and Challenges 
This tool relies heavily on accurate information and coastal hazard mapping to provide grounds for 
the approval or refusal of a subdivision. Implementation requires that an Approving Officer or similar 
designate exercise their authority to allow or refuse the subdivision of land at risk from coastal hazards. 
Where the nature and extent of the risk has not been determined, the Approving Officer can withhold 
subdivision approval pending a report from a qualified professional. A qualified professional (i.e., engineer 
or geoscientist) can determine mitigation measures that would allow the land use; however the Approving 
Officer still has the discretion to reject the subdivision.

Advantages

Disadvantages

Most local governments have the legal mandate to 
establish by bylaw the conditions under which the 
subdivision of land can proceed.
The role of the Approving Officer provides for some 
degree of separation from political influence. The ability 
of an Approving Officer to protect the public interest 
by refusing to approve a subdivision has been well 
established by case law.
This tool allows the conditions of future development  
to be regulated. 

The loss of potential development value could result 
in resistance from developers. Reducing subdivision of 
coastal land should not be undertaken ad hoc or without 
supporting guiding policy or a strategy in place.
Without the identification of coastal hazard areas at risk 
of flooding and erosion, it is difficult for the approving 
body to decline subdivision on the grounds of safety.
Subdivision approval is discretionary; but is subject to 
the prescribed scope of authority. The quality of decision 
making is dependent on the capabilities of those 
appointed.

Regulatory Tools3. Development Permit

Tool Description
A Development Permit is a form of land use regulation distinctive to B.C. It is identified separately because 
it combines policy objectives and guidelines with site specific regulation. A Development Permit can 
regulate development for a variety of purposes, two of which are applicable to sea level rise:
•  protection of the natural environment, its ecosystems and biological diversity; and 
•  protection of development from hazardous conditions.

In the former case, a Development Permit Area (DPA) may specify areas of land that must remain free of 
development, except in accordance with any conditions contained in the permit, or require specified 
natural features or areas to be preserved, protected, restored or enhanced in accordance with the permit. 
In the latter case, a DPA may specify areas of land that may be subject to flooding, mud flows, or torrents of 
debris, and specify the guidelines under which the objectives will be addressed. In each case, the purpose 
of the Development Permit is for the specified objectives to be met prior to a development proceeding. 

Application
This tool is used to identify areas where special conditions apply. The objectives of the Development Permit 
must be established and guidance given for addressing the objectives. While this tool is specific to B.C. 
legislation, there are other similar processes in Atlantic Canada. For example, Halifax Regional Municipality 
is managing waterfront development in Halifax Harbour by development agreements in which proponents 
must account for sea level rise.

Enabling Legislation
In B.C., a local government can establish Development Permit Areas under Section 919.1 of the Local 
Government Act. A DPA and guidelines can be included in an Official Community Plan or a zoning bylaw. 
Where a DPA has been designated by bylaw, no subdivision, building construction or alteration, or 
alteration of land can proceed unless a Development Permit has first been issued by the local government. 
In order to address the hazardous conditions specified in the DPA, the local government may require that 
the applicant provide a report certified by a professional engineer. When a local government has issued a 
Development Permit, it must file a notice in the Land Title Office that the land is subject to the conditions 
specified in the Development Permit. If an OCP designates areas as requiring a Development Permit, this 
must be issued prior to the subdivision of land within the area and the construction of, addition to or 
alteration of a building or other structure.

Evaluation and Governance Considerations
Economic – The creation of Development Permit Areas and the granting or refusal of applications with 
respect to these areas involves an additional step in the development and permitting process. The cost 
of the independent professional and the cost of meeting the Development Permit conditions can also be 
considerable. The onus is on the applicant to demonstrate that land that might otherwise not be developed 
can be done so safely.

Environmental – A DPA is one of the few tools available to a local government where the primary focus can 
be on protection of the natural environment and biodiversity. Examples could include sand dunes, coastal 
bluffs, and beaches.

Social – The establishment of a Development Permit Area in an OCP or zoning bylaw requires a public 
hearing.

46

Regulatory ToolsImplementation Measures and Challenges 
Implementation requires that an Official Community Plan designate a DPA. This includes an amending bylaw 
and public hearing. Once a DPA is in place, a resolution of approval is required from the local government for 
a specific development. The main challenge is preparing background studies of hazards and environmentally 
sensitive areas to justify the DPA.

Advantages

Disadvantages

Hazardous areas must be documented and identified 
prior to their designation. Smaller jurisdictions may lack 
the necessary planning or technical resources. 
The use of a Development Permit is an additional 
procedural requirement for a developer or landowner. 
However, the additional time by itself can be as little as 
four weeks and a Development Permit can be processed 
concurrently with a rezoning or subdivision application. 
Objectives and guidelines need to be well crafted. A 
Development Permit cannot be turned down by the local 
government if the specified objectives and guidelines are 
met. This can be an advantage as well as a disadvantage.

The use of a Development Permit enables land use 
planning objectives to be implemented prior to a 
development proceeding. 
A DPA can be included in an Official Community Plan 
with a narrative describing the objectives that justify the 
designation and specifying the guidelines for addressing 
the objectives, accompanied by a map.  
The scope is very broad, as it includes subdivisions, 
building construction (whether or not a building permit 
is required) and alteration of land (e.g. re-grading, soil 
removal or soil deposition). 
The use of a Development Permit allows for an 
independent professional to address risk (i.e., professional 
engineer with relevant expertise) at the applicant’s 
expense.
No change in existing legislation is needed to create  
a Sea Level Rise Development Permit Area or Coastal 
Hazard Development Permit Area.
Use of this tool requires a notice to be filed in the Land 
Title Office. As a result, any purchaser is deemed to be 
notified of hazardous conditions. 

4. Building Regulation

Tool Description
Local communities have a tools which can be used to influence the manner in which buildings are situated 
and constructed.

Application
This tool is applicable to all building construction or significant retrofits. The use of this tool is the last 
opportunity to avoid exposure to hazards, including coastal hazards.

Enabling Legislation
Under the terms of the Constitution Act, building regulation in Canada is the responsibility of provincial and 
territorial governments. The Canadian Commission on Building and Fires Codes works with stakeholders 
and researches to develop a model National Building Code. Most provinces and territories have adopted 
the National Building Code or adapted it with variations and additions. The National Building Code does 
not have specific design requirements to protect buildings from coastal hazards but does ensure that 
buildings are constructed to certain safety and design standards.

47

Regulatory ToolsAlthough not all local governments in British Columbia have chosen to enforce the provincial 
code, technically, the code applies throughout the province. In addition, through powers provided 
under section 910 of the Local Government’s Act municipalities may introduce certain construction 
requirements in a floodplains.

The City of Vancouver is unique among municipalities in B.C. It has its own enabling provincial legislation 
called the Vancouver Charter. Under this charter, Vancouver has developed a building bylaw which is 
based on the B.C. Building Code, with local amendments. This bylaw regulates buildings on lands subject to 
flooding by establishing minimum flood construction levels (FCLs), specifying construction materials, and 
service equipment installation, and allowing for covenants on a property title which acknowledge the risk 
of flood damage.

The B.C. Community Charter provides an alternative way that building restrictions may be imposed to 
address flood hazards. Under section 56 of this Act, a municipal building inspector may withhold the 
issuance of a building permit until satisfied the land can be safely used and can require a geotechnical 
report by a qualified professional if construction is proposed on land likely to be subject to hazards such  
as flooding or erosion.

A building permit can be refused until the owner agrees to a covenant on the property title stating that the 
land will only be used in the manner certified in the report. Regional districts have similar authorities under 
section 695 of the Local Government Act.

In Quebec, adaptation to sea level rise is currently not addressed in provincial regulations governing the 
authority of local governments to deal with zoning bylaws, home-owner building permits or subdivisions. 
The province develops planning strategies, then Regional County Municipalities (RCMs) are responsible for 
integrating the strategies in their Schémas d’aménagement (regional plans), and the municipalities within 
the RCMs then enact bylaws and regulations to implement the measures in the Schéma. The province 
develops policies and makes recommendations they hope the local authorities (cities) and regional 
authorities (RCMs) will adopt, however, there is no forced compliance from one level to the next. In some 
cases, depending on the type of construction, permits can be issued by regional or provincial authorities.

In Atlantic Canada there is a general provision under provincial planning legislation for the granting 
of building permits in non-incorporated areas. In Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, regional planning 
commissions can generate regional plans and bylaws. Most of the larger municipalities in all four Atlantic 
Provinces have the authority to prepare their own official plan and bylaws. Where official plans and bylaws 
exist, development officers or building inspectors issue permits. In some cases, there are provisions in place 
to restrict development in areas vulnerable to coastal hazards. In Prince Edward Island, the Planning Act, 
(Section 8), provides for the regulation of land use activities in non-incorporated areas. The Planning Act, 
Subdivision and Development Regulations, provides measures for setbacks in coastal areas of a minimum 
width of 60 feet (18.3 metres) or 60 times the annual erosion rate for the area (Section 16). In Newfoundland 
and Labrador, the Urban and Rural Planning Act empowers the formation of regional planning commissions 
in the province, and there are currently two commissions in place.

Evaluation and Governance Considerations
Economic – Building regulation as an adaptation tool has two primary purposes: the protection of property 
and public safety. The economic costs associated with the use of this tool are not easy to quantify due to 
the wide variety of circumstances that may apply. Local government review and processing costs and legal 
costs are likely to be modest to moderate. Similarly, the cost of implementing protective measures vary 
widely. In some cases a project may have to be abandoned if a qualified professional cannot certify that a 
building can be safely constructed for the intended use or that the cost for doing so would be excessive.

48

Regulatory ToolsEnvironmental – Building restrictions as an adaptation tool only address identified hazards including 
natural hazards such as erosion and flooding.

This regulatory tool is not intended to address environmental criteria. Other planning tools that typically 
occur at an earlier stage in the development process should be used to address environmental criteria (e.g., 
growth management policies, easement, land purchase, subdivision, and zoning).

Social – This tool is designed to address public safety. The intent of this tool is to ensure that the occupants 
of a building are not subject to excessive risk. If a building cannot safely be constructed in a particular 
location or if the cost of doing so is economically prohibitive then it will not be constructed, thus reducing 
the risk to people and property. The use of this tool gives priority to the protection of the public.

Implementation Measures and Challenges 
In B.C. the Community Charter and Local Government Act authorizes the local government building 
inspectors to withhold the issuance of a Building Permit unless a qualified professional can provide a report 
certifying the land can be used safely for the intended purpose. Unfortunately, there are a limited number 
of qualified professionals for this specialized work. One challenge cited mainly by smaller and more remote 
municipalities is a lack of knowledge as to who is qualified to undertake this specialized work and whether 
the conclusions arrived at are appropriate. In some smaller communities, local government has chosen not 
to undertake a building inspection function and so in these areas, this tool cannot be used.

Advantages

Disadvantages

The key advantage of this tool is its ability to place 
restrictions on building construction until the hazard risk 
has been addressed. 
This tool enables site specific measures to be 
incorporated as an integral part of the construction  
of a building.
An indirect advantage of this tool is its ability to prevent 
the transfer of risk from one property owner to another 
unknowing purchaser. Registration of a covenant on title 
ensures that any future owner or prospective purchaser  
is aware of the site-specific building requirements. (B.C.)

The application of this tool comes late in the 
development process. This can be a concern if a property 
owner is not aware of any potential risk and only finds out 
when a building permit application is submitted.
Local governments may not have the technical resources  
to give guidance in determining the minimum elevation 
for safe building construction (i.e., Flood Construction 
Level). This is a significant concern for local government 
officials with limited resources.
Reliance on a qualified professional introduces the risk 
of retaining a person who lacks the necessary skills. 
In B.C. the Association of Professional Engineers and 
Geoscientists are addressing this risk by preparing 
guidelines for qualified professionals working to 
mitigate flood risks and adapt to sea level rise.
Where building regulation or enforcement has not been 
adopted as a local government function, this tool will not  
be available. 

49

Regulatory ToolsLand Use Change or Restriction Tools

1. Land Acquisition

Tool Description
Local governments can gain ownership of land for the primary purpose of addressing public safety through 
purchase or expropriation. Land can be acquired for a variety of purposes, including structural protection 
works (i.e., a dike or other hard protection), vehicular access or setbacks for public safety. Land can also be 
acquired to prevent the development or to hold it in public ownership for exclusive public use. 

Application
Land can be acquired to accommodate a new dike, for the landward expansion of an existing dike or as the 
land base needed for other forms of structural protection.  

Land acquisition can be used to provide public open space, protect rare or endangered habitat or create 
an ecological reserve. It can also be used to avoid the cost of servicing land at risk due to sea level rise. 
Land purchase may take place to prevent the development of land subject to hazards, however if land is 
required for a public purpose, government cannot simply downzone land for exclusive public use without 
compensating the owner. 

Expropriation is perceived as an option of last resort, as an independent third party or the courts are the 
final determinants of the land value. Expropriation may also be referred to as a compulsory acquisition, 
compulsory purchase or eminent domain.

Enabling Legislation
A municipality is authorized to expropriate property in accordance with the Expropriation Act under  
Section 31 of the Community Charter. Similar provisions to acquire or expropriate land exist in Atlantic 
Canada.

Evaluation and Governance Considerations
Economic – Land acquisition is potentially expensive and there are ongoing costs and liability associated 
with ownership. Any tax revenue generated from the land is forgone once it transfers to local government 
ownership.

Environmental – This tool can be used to protect environmentally sensitive land where development is not 
advisable or for foreshore protection such as soft armouring. Land acquisition may also be used to provide for 
public open space purposes subject to restrictions on improvements and the timing and extent of activities.

Social – There are social considerations and impacts associated with the acquisition of private land to 
protect the public interest. Local governments may have to acquire large sections of land necessary to 
expand a linear corridor (e.g. dike or seawall). Social benefits may include the acquisition of public open 
space and public access along a dike. In communities where expropriation is used, there may be negative 
impacts to local landowners.

50

Land Use Change or Restriction ToolsImplementation Measures and Challenges
Key challenges in the acquisition of land include obtaining the necessary funds for a land purchase, 
agreeing on fair market value and obtaining political support for land expropriation. Land expropriation 
is typically undertaken by a local government but may include a provincial government agency. Strategic 
or Official Community Plans may identify properties needed for future land acquisition and, if so, make 
provisions for funding these acquisitions. 

Example of Land Acquisition from Bas-Saint-Laurent, Quebec

In 2010 in the Bas-Saint-Laurent of Quebec, 100 homes were destroyed due to a storm event which 
eroded seven metres of shoreline. In response, the Province of Quebec offered to compensate 
homeowners for relocation, and the properties were then offered for sale to the municipality for $1.00. 
The role of the Province in this case allowed the municipality to acquire the land at risk and gain control 
of it to prevent future development. 

Advantages

Disadvantages

An important tool for implementing linear protection 
measures (e.g. dikes) where existing land ownership 
boundaries do not allow a cost effective configuration  
for shoreline management. 
Land purchase may be used in combination with other 
tools to reduce the cost of flood protection (e.g., dike 
vs. seawall). This will require a comparative analysis of 
options that includes the cost of land and structural tools.
Where necessary, expropriation enables property 
acquisition if a voluntary purchase is not possible.
Land purchase may also be the preferred outcome of 
a cost-benefit analysis where other options are more 
expensive. 
Land purchase can be a key element in a managed  
retreat strategy.

This tool is primarily used to protect urban development 
and may include the high costs of acquiring and 
demolishing existing building improvements. 
Land acquisition involves the use of scarce financial 
resources. Both local and senior governments may be 
reluctant to set aside funds for land acquisition unless 
this is part of a capital improvement project. 
Expropriation has the disadvantage that price is not 
controlled by the acquiring agency. 
Expropriation is typically seen as an option of last resort 
and is not typically viewed favourably by the general 
public or land owners.
The availability of land offered for public acquisition often 
has a short window of opportunity following the decision 
of an owner to sell the land or the death of an owner.

2. Transfer of Development Potential

Tool Description
This tool refers to the transfer of a property’s development potential under current zoning provisions from 
one site or property to another. If a parcel is considered at risk, the “as of right” development potential can 
be relocated to another area of land or parcel not at risk. 

Density transfer is primarily a voluntary, market-based concept in which the transfer of development 
potential offers protection for sensitive coastal resources and removes it from hazard areas. The tool can 
direct development away from the area at risk by designating the “donor” or “sending” area and allocating  
it to an appropriate “receiving” area where development or increased density can be safely accommodated. 

51

Land Use Change or Restriction ToolsApplication
This tool is utilized in association with zoning where the development potential is measurable (e.g. the 
number of dwellings units or floor space ratio). Density transfer could apply to any land use but is typically 
applied to residential uses. The development potential of the “sending” site is reduced and the density of 
the “receiving” site is increased. An Official Community Plan or other similar policy document is needed to 
determine both areas at risk and areas where additional density is deemed suitable. 

Density transfer may be achieved using a “density bank” in which a specific density is removed from the 
“sending” site without the need to identify a “receiving” site. Density transfer relies on an administrative 
process to regulate exchanges and a market to determine value. Density transfer could be applied in any 
municipality and would be best used in conjunction with a strategic plan where managed retreat is an 
objective.

Enabling Legislation
The transfer of development potential can occur within the normal powers of zoning. Its application in 
Canada has mainly been for heritage conservation purposes but it could be used as a tool for adaptation 
to sea level rise. 

Evaluation and Governance Considerations
Economic – This tool essentially assigns an economic value to a property’s development potential. The 
development potential of areas at risk are then restricted and the value transferred to areas suitable for 
increased density. A market-based mechanism is used to determine the value of the density transfer. 

Environmental – The successful implementation of this tool could protect sensitive coastal areas at 
risk from development activity. Limited development could lead to the expansion of environmentally 
sensitive habitat, allowing intertidal habitats to expand where otherwise they might be reduced due  
to coastal squeeze.

Social – The primary use of this tool would be to reduce the development or redevelopment potential  
of land in areas at risk due to sea level rise.

Implementation Measures and Challenges 
Implementation requires both an administrative process and a market that provides an incentive to 
developers. Although largely a market-based tool, it requires organization and administrative support  
from the local government.

Transfer of development potential has received considerable interest in planning literature, particularly 
in the U.S.A. where the concept is referred to as “transfer of development rights.” However, the successful 
implementation of the concept has been very limited, as it poses challenges in terms of equity and 
administration for owners of both donor and receiving sites and does not have particularly wide appeal to 
property developers. As an example, the City of Vancouver used a density transfer system for many years  
to encourage heritage conservation; however, this has resulted in more density “in the bank” than could  
be used, leading to a moratorium on density banking.

52

Land Use Change or Restriction ToolsAdvantages

Disadvantages

Although not currently widely used, this tool is within a 
local government’s zoning authority.
This tool is market-based and could be structured so local 
government requirements are limited to administrative 
costs.
Transfer of density potential could be combined with 
land acquisition in which the local government acquires 
ownership of the land and transfers the development 
potential to the former owner elsewhere in the same 
municipality.
Density transfer may provide a less costly alternative 
to land acquisition (whether voluntary or through 
expropriation). 

This tool depends upon the assumption that every parcel 
of land has development potential that can be quantified 
and transferred to an alternative location. 
Density transfer has limited potential for small 
communities or ones with a static or declining 
population.
Owners of coastal properties may resent land use 
restrictions or “down-zoning” if they perceive no 
imminent risk.
As a voluntary undertaking, the transfer of development 
potential may not prevent the development of areas at 
risk from coastal hazards.

3. Easements and Covenants

Tool Description
An easement is a legal agreement in which one landowner grants the use of some real property rights to 
another for a specific purpose. It represents an interest in land but not the right of exclusive possession. 
It can be used to allow access over, use of or other limitation that benefits one piece of land (known as 
the dominant tenement) and burdens another (known as the servient tenement) without resulting in a 
change of ownership. In B.C., a statutory right-of-way is similar to an easement. This B.C. variation is used 
to avoid the need for two properties, one with a dominant and the other with a servient tenement. The use 
of a statutory right of way is restricted to a government body, Crown Corporation or similar entity. Both 
covenants and easements “run with the land”, meaning they bind current as well as future owners.88

A covenant can be used to restrict the use of land for a particular purpose. In B.C. and P.E.I., a covenant can 
also be of a positive or negative nature requiring an undertaking by a landowner. Examples of positive 
undertakings would be requirements to plant trees or to maintain privately owned flood protection works. 
Restrictive or negative requirements would include a limitation on development for flood protection 
purposes or prevention of the use of fill. 

In Quebec, the Civil Code of Quebec makes provision for servitudes. A servitude is a charge on one parcel 
of land for the benefit of another. A servitude closely corresponds to an easement. Each of these legal 
instruments can be used to restrict part or all of a property for a particular purpose without the need for  
a change of ownership.89 

Application
An easement, covenant, right-of-way or servitude can be registered on the title of any piece of property; 
however, the agreement of the property owner is required. Easements are commonly used to provide 
the right of access through a property. A statutory right-of-way is similar but involves a public body. Both 
typically involve a legal survey or explanatory plan registered as a charge on the property title. 

A covenant is a written agreement between two or more parties to limit the use of the land in a particular 
way or require the land be used in a particular way. For an easement, statutory right-of-way or covenant  
to be enforceable, a purchaser of property must be given notification of its existence. The purchaser is

53

Land Use Change or Restriction Toolsdeemed to have notice if the legal instrument is registered on the certificate of title of the property in the 
applicable provincial land registry. It remains on the land and is automatically transferred from one owner 
to another if the land is sold. 

Enabling Legislation
In common law jurisdictions in Canada (every province but Quebec), easements and covenants are authorized 
by either common law or statute. In Quebec, the Civil Code of Quebec makes provision for servitudes.90

In B.C., an easement, statutory right-of-way and/or covenant may be registered as a charge on the title 
of land under Division 4 (S.218-223) of the Land Title Act. These tools can have broad applications in 
addressing coastal hazards. For example a covenant can include provisions restricting the use of land 
or provisions limiting or preventing building on the land, or preventing its subdivision. The Act specifies 
that such a covenant may be of a negative or positive nature and may include a provision that land be 
protected, preserved, conserved, maintained, enhanced, restored or kept in its natural or existing state  
in accordance with the covenant and to the extent provided in the covenant. 

In Quebec the Natural Heritage Conservation Act allows the registration of a nature reserve agreement 
to be registered against a land title. More specifically, the purpose of this Act is to contribute to the 
objective of safeguarding the character, diversity and integrity of Quebec’s natural heritage through 
measures intended to protect its biological diversity and the life-sustaining elements of natural settings. 
The Act is intended to facilitate the establishment of a network of protected areas representative of 
biodiversity by introducing protection measures for natural settings that complete existing measures, 
including the assigning of protection status to certain areas under the responsibility of other 
government departments or bodies.

In New Brunswick, under the Conservation Easements Act, a municipality or any agency of a municipality 
may hold a conservation easement for a variety of reasons such as: the protection, enhancement or 
restoration of natural ecosystems; the conservation or protection of soil, air, land or water; the protection  
or use of land for outdoor recreation; or the use of land for public education.

Nova Scotia follows the 2001 Conservation Easement Act which enables a conservation easement to be 
entered into between an owner and an eligible body for the purpose of protecting, restoring or enhancing 
land that: contains natural ecosystems or constitutes the habitat of rare, threatened or endangered plant 
or animal species; provides a haven for concentrations of birds and animals; provides opportunities 
for scientific or educational programs in aspects of the natural environment; or is representative of the 
ecosystems, landforms or landscapes of the province.

The Natural Areas Protection Act of P.E.I. is intended to preserve natural areas. Under this Act, a private 
landowner may impose a restrictive covenant on his or her land by entering into an agreement with a 
covenant holder. Such a restrictive covenant may be positive or negative in nature and prohibit specific uses 
of the land. “Natural areas” are defined by the Act and include parcels of land that: provide haven for seasonal 
concentrations of birds and animals; or provide opportunities for scientific and educational programs in 
aspects of the natural environment.

Newfoundland and Labrador has no specific conservation easement legislation. However, the Historic 
Resources Act authorizes covenants or easements for the protection of historic resources. The Act’s definition of 
“historic resources” is broad enough to cover some lands with conservation values.91 The Act defines “historic 
resources” as a work of nature or of humans that is primarily of value for its archaeological, prehistoric, historic, 
cultural, natural, scientific or aesthetic interest, including an archaeological, prehistoric, historic or natural site, 
structure or object.

Land Use Change or Restriction ToolsEvaluation and Governance Considerations
Economic – Economic considerations can include the cost of restricting land use to reduce the risk of 
damage to land or buildings. A Save Harmless provision in a covenant can be used to protect a local 
government from financial damages in the event of future flooding. The cost of an easement or statutory 
right-of-way will vary depending on the applicable conditions – an appraisal is frequently used to 
determine fair market value. Compensation to the owner could be through a lump sum or an annual 
payment based on a percentage of market value. A local government may be able to issue a tax receipt  
for a conservation easement if it is classified as a charitable gift by the Canada Revenue Agency.

Environmental – This tool is well suited to conservation purposes. Part or all of the land may be restricted 
for habitat conservation and a covenant may also be used as means of requiring an undertaking for 
environment enhancement purposes.

Social – Using this tool provides an alternative to land acquisition that meets the needs both of the 
landowner and the local government. This could include limited development or no development on land 
subject to coastal hazards, but not necessarily restriction of the whole parcel. This tool offers flexibility 
without a change in ownership or subdivision.

Implementation Measures and Challenges 
Implementation measures include approval by the local government of the easement or other land use 
restriction and may include the services of a lawyer, appraiser and legal surveyor. Challenges may include 
securing an agreement with the land owner as to the nature, value and funding of the restriction.

Advantages

Disadvantages

Annual compensation or a lump sum payment may be 
required to secure the easement or statutory right of  
way process or servitude.

The easement or other restriction can be limited to a 
particular part of a site, a particular purpose or a specific 
time period. 
The owner is able to retain ownership of the property  
and may be able to use areas not at risk. 
The cost for a covenant or statutory right-of-way is 
typically much less than fee simple acquisition.
A covenant may be used in conjunction with other tools 
such as subdivision, building or land use regulation. 
A conservation easement may be considered a charitable 
gift by the Canada Revenue Agency.
A covenant may be negotiated as part of the 
development approval process with no direct cost to  
the local government.

4. Land Trusts

Tool Description
A land trust is a non-profit private organization created for the purpose of environmental conservation or 
other similar purpose. While there are many land trust organizations in Canada, their general objective is  
to acquire ecologically significant, often threatened, land through purchase, donation, covenant or lease. 

Land trusts consist of nationally or provincially based organizations, typically non-profit societies with the 
ability to offer tax deductible charitable receipts. National organizations include Ducks Unlimited Canada 
and the Nature Conservancy of Canada. Provincial organizations include the Nature Conservancy of British 

55

Land Use Change or Restriction ToolsColumbia, Land Trust Alliance of B.C., The Land Conservancy (TLC) of B.C., Nature Action Quebec, the Nature 
Trust of New Brunswick, the Island Trust in P.E.I, and the Nova Scotia Nature Trust.

Application
Land trusts work with individual donors, foundations, corporations, and all levels of government to acquire 
and maintain land for environmental conservation purposes. Land trusts may work in a variety of ways to 
address their individual mandates; these can include accepting gifts of land from private donors, undertaking 
fundraising to acquire land to prevent the loss of environmentally significant values, and managing land in 
public ownership to protect and enhance its habitat and other environmental characteristics. 

A conservation agreement is central to land trusts. While this does not specifically refer to adaptation to sea 
level rise, the conservation objectives of existing land trusts can easily accommodate this aspect, particularly 
with habitat creation or enhancements such as coastal wetland and sand dune creation, or rehabilitation.

Trust of B.C.)

Evaluation and Governance Considerations
Economic – The cost of land acquisition as well as the cost of restoration and maintenance would likely 
be borne by the land trust organization. Local government could facilitate involvement of a land trust 
without necessarily expending financial resources and achieve the objective of protecting people from 
coastal hazards.

Environmental – This tool is well suited to acquire and protect environmentally sensitive land without local 
government having to take on responsibility for the land itself. 

Social – This tool can either restrict or enhance public access to environmentally sensitive land or habitat 
rehabilitation areas. In addition, this tool potentially has wider appeal for application by those wishing to 
conserve environmentally sensitive areas in perpetuity.

Implementation Measures and Challenges 
The implementation of this tool can include acquiring land by a land trust through fundraising, eco-gift, or 
government transfer, preparing a conservation agreement, and undertaking the necessary restoration and 
maintenance of the land once an easement, covenant or other restriction is in place. Challenges include 
obtaining the resources to acquire, restore, and manage environmentally significant lands. Time constraints 
may also apply.

Land Use Change or Restriction ToolsAdvantages

Disadvantages

The cost of land acquisition may limit the ability of a land 
trust to secure and restore environmentally significant 
land. 
The appeal of land acquisitions varies greatly depending 
on the type of environmentally significant land and the 
cost of maintaining or restoring the land.

Land trusts are primarily used for environmental 
protection and enhancement. 
Many donors are more receptive to private stewardship of 
environmentally sensitive land than to donating the land 
to government. 
Many land trusts have an extensive and exemplary record 
of environmental stewardship. 
Fundraising for privately managed land acquisition by a 
land trust offers opportunities that may not be available if 
government is involved.
Local governments can work collaboratively with 
land trusts to identify areas that may be suited to 
environmental protection and play a facilitation role but 
leave the negotiation with the land owner up to the trust.

5. Foreshore Tenure

Tool Description
A foreshore tenure is a legal instrument that authorizes a use or uses over intertidal and subtidal areas. 
This may include a lease or licence of occupation. In B.C., the foreshore generally refers to the area below 
the natural boundary.92 In Atlantic Canada, the foreshore refers to the area below the high water mark. A 
foreshore tenure by itself will not provide protection from coastal hazards. However, it may, in conjunction 
with zoning, provide the mechanism to enable a more comprehensive approach to shoreline management. 

Application
A foreshore tenure could be applied to almost all of Canada’s southern coasts. Foreshore tenure is generally 
granted by the applicable provincial government, although there are some exceptions, most notably 
with respect to harbours established under the Canadian Marine Act. Foreshore tenure does not affect the 
underlying Crown ownership of land (including land under water) but it can be used by a local government 
as part of a comprehensive approach to shoreline management such as beach nourishment, sand dune or 
coastal wetland creation and/or rehabilitation as well as hard structural protection.

A foreshore lease is one form of tenure. In B.C. foreshore leases require a legal survey to define the tenure 
area and are typically issued for periods of 10 to 30 years. The term “water lot” is frequently used as an 
alternative. If the lease is surveyed and has a term of 5 or more years, it can be registered in the Land Title 
Office. A licence of occupation may be used if the term is short, where minimal improvements are proposed 
or for remote sites where survey costs may be prohibitive. A statutory right of way may also be used to 
accommodate a linear corridor within a foreshore area. 

The issuance of a foreshore lease is typically by application to the provincial government or another agency 
with jurisdiction. The interests of riparian owners and First Nations must usually be considered and the 
lease must be consistent with zoning by local government or other applicable authorities. 

In a few instances, a municipality has partnered with the Crown to take over the administration and 
management of foreshore areas. An example is a head lease.  Under this arrangement, the municipality is 
granted long-term tenure over a foreshore area with a revenue-sharing arrangement with the Crown. In 

92 

In B.C., the “natural boundary” is defined in the Land Act as, “the visible high water mark of any lake, river, stream or other body of water 
where the presence and action of the water are so common and usual, and so long continued in all ordinary years, as to mark on the soil 
of the bed of the body of water a character distinct from that of its banks, in vegetation, as well as in the nature of the soil itself.”

57

Land Use Change or Restriction Toolsreturn the head lease transfers responsibility for management and environment issues to the municipality.  
Head leases are not commonly issued to municipalities unless there is demonstrated business case with a 
high benefit to the Province.

Example of Foreshore Tenure from West Vancouver head lease, B.C. 

Since 1974, the District of West Vancouver has held a head lease with the Province of B.C. for the 
management of land covered by water from the high water mark extending 1,000 m into Burrard Inlet. 
Only the foreshore areas controlled by the Vancouver Port Authority and the B.C. Ferries Terminal in 
Horseshoe Bay are excluded. As a result of this partnership, a new 30 year head lease will commence  
in 2014. 

The lease covers any community purposes under the Community and Institutional Crown land policy. 
This includes public access infrastructure such as walkways, seawalls, boat ramps, piers, wharves, and 
five marinas. Utility works are included, as well as natural enhancements such as groynes, rock reefs 
and riprap. The lease authorizes subleases and includes a revenue sharing agreement with the Province 
of B.C., while the District of West Vancouver assumes management responsibility and liability under 
the head lease. The head lease is subject to the rights of riparian owners or occupiers of adjoining land. 
The District also has adopted Official Community Plan policies to protect the foreshore and a 5 year 
foreshore protection plan. A number of enhancement works are currently underway with the active 
support of affected riparian owners.

Enabling Legislation
In B.C. foreshore leases and licences of occupation are typically granted by the Province under the Land Act. 
The Local Government Act provides for local government regulation over the surface of the foreshore area 
through Official Community Plans and zoning authority. 

The province of Nova Scotia has a Beaches and Foreshores Act which allows for grants or leases of any tidal 
flat, beach or foreshore. The N.S. Department of Natural Resources issues leases on submerged crown lands 
for commercial purposes such as wharves, marinas, power generation, utility cables, etc. 

In Newfoundland and Labrador, the Lands Act, Section 7, provides for a reservation of shoreline on Crown 
lands that border a lake, pond, river, the seashore or foreshore, and that are granted, leased or licensed to 
another party, that a 15 metre wide strip of land is maintained as a reserve by the province. The Lands Act of 
Newfoundland and Labrador also gives authority to the provincial government to issue leases on foreshore 
areas for aquaculture licensing. 

On P.E.I., water lots in waterfront areas can be privately owned. The Department of Fisheries and Oceans 
administers the licensing and leasing of aquaculture operations via the Fisheries Act. The infilling of 
harbours, such as a project in Summerside in 2002, requires federal approval under subsection 35 of the 
Federal Fisheries Act.

New Brunswick has had the authority under Common Law to issue foreshore leases or grants for oyster 
fishing, for up to a 10 year period, since 1866.

58

Land Use Change or Restriction ToolsWest Vancouver, B.C. Seawall

Evaluation and Governance Considerations
Economic – In B.C., the cost of a foreshore lease is set by the Province. The assessed or market value of a 
lease may be set at a percentage of the land value, for example 8% annually. Nominal rent tenure applies 
if the lease qualifies under the Community and Institutional Land Use Policy of the Ministry of Forests, 
Lands, and Natural Resource Operations. This policy applies to eligible public sector organizations, local 
governments, First Nations and community organizations.

Environmental – A foreshore lease allows the management of the foreshore to be treated as more of a 
complete system rather than stopping at the traditional jurisdictional boundary of the high tide mark 
or natural boundary. This can facilitate implementation of innovative soft armoring approaches such 
as habitat enhancement of intertidal areas, beach nourishment or the creation of wetlands. In B.C. the 
holder of a foreshore tenure is responsible for clean-up of any contamination that occurs within the 
tenure boundaries.

Social – Local governance tenure over the foreshore can allow for partnerships with riparian owners and 
local community groups to provide protection for upland areas or intertidal habitats. This can help foster 
a sense of ownership and responsibility at the community level for adaptation along the coast. Increased 
recreational use may provide an additional indirect benefit. 

Implementation Measures and Challenges 
In British Columbia, foreshore leases have typically been used for marine facilities associated with upland 
development. One challenge will be to refocus this tool as part of a sea level rise adaptation strategy. 
In addition, it must be recognized that this tool will have limited suitability due to environmental, 
bathymetric and other constraints.

The District of West Vancouver provides an excellent model for foreshore management. The District has 
worked in co-operation with upland owners and has not detrimentally affected fish habitat. In addition, 
foreshore leases do not affect any federally controlled waterways such as shipping channels for the Port 
of Vancouver or BC Ferries routes.

59

Land Use Change or Restriction ToolsAdvantages

Disadvantages

Foreshore tenure could enable a local government to 
undertake a broader range of shoreline management  
and adaptation measures in response to coastal hazards.
A foreshore lease (or other form of tenure) could enable 
environmental enhancement to occur with less reliance 
on structural protection. Possible applications include 
beach nourishment or the creation of off-shore islands 
and sand dunes.

A foreshore lease does not absolve the holder of any 
responsibility under the Fisheries Act or Navigable Waters 
Protection Act.
There will be costs associated with a foreshore lease, 
which could range from a nominal cost to fair market 
value (prepaid or annual lease payment).
The applicability of this tool will be limited to areas with 
suitable shoreline conditions and bathymetry.

Land Use Change or Restriction ToolsStructural (Flood Protection Works)

1. Scour Protection

Tool Description
Scour protection is a property-specific structural tool used to protect shoreline structures or building 
foundations from being eroded or undermined due to the effects of moving water. Scour protection 
consists of riprap or structural elements designed to withstand wave action and the force of moving water. 
It can take different forms depending on the application: a scour apron refers to site-specific protection 
around the base of a building or structure whereas a scour blanket refers to measures to protect a covered 
or partially covered asset such as a pipeline, outfall or underground utility from damage by floodwater. 

Application
Scour protection is typically applied to the foundation of a building or structure and is often used in 
conjunction with structural elevation. In this case the scour protection would be implemented around the 
building or structural element foundation. Other commonly used applications include protecting the base 
of transmission towers, bridge foundations, seawalls, and along coastal corridors containing a highway, 
railway or pipeline. Scour protection can be an integral part of a shoreline protection system such as 
armour rock, gabions, concrete slabs, and similar systems.

Evaluation and Governance Considerations
Economic – There are costs associated with erosion protection measures. A scour apron, typically includes 
an apron of riprap outside the perimeter wall installed down to the depth of the potential scour around the 
site. The surface may include a gravel topping or filter fabric as well as topsoil for landscaping. Other scour 
protection may take the form of pile foundations designed to derive vertical and lateral support below the 
depth of scour. Pile foundations are more expensive than conventional spread foundations, but they are 
not common for single storey residential structures.

A scour apron may be used to support retaining walls of linear infrastructure (e.g. dikes) to ensure the toe  
of the structure is protected. For a submerged structure such as a pipeline, a scour blanket typically consists 
of an armouring of filter stone around the structure and a cover stone above it.

Environmental – Scour protection primarily addresses the protection of building foundations and linear 
structure foundations. Environmental impacts will be limited for buildings, but may increase in magnitude 
where scour protection is introduced along a linear corridor such a seawall, stormwater outfall or a pipeline 
crossing. Intertidal areas are typically associated with high environmental values, and protective measures 
may result in some reduction or loss of environmental quality.

Social – This tool is intended to minimize risk to the foundations of buildings and structures. If the risk to a 
building is reduced, the risk to inhabitants and employees also decreases. 

61

Structural Tools (Flood Protection Works)Implementation Measures and Challenges 
Implementation typically occurs following an engineering analysis of risk and appropriate mitigation measures. 
A design drawing is produced, showing the minimum requirements to implement the erosion/scour protection 
measures. The contractor or other responsible party then constructs the scour protection according to the 
specifications provided. The tool may be implemented in conjunction with other requirements as determined 
by a building inspector, approving officer or the terms set within a covenant on title.

Challenges can occur if the extent of the risk increases over time or is not known or identified, with the 
result that scour protection measures are not requested. If there are no gatekeepers responsible for public 
protection, the risk to a specific building or infrastructure corridor may be overlooked even if the property 
owner is conscientious. In the absence of regulatory requirements or regular inspection, information 
resources can provide general guidelines alerting a property owner to the benefits of scour protection in 
areas subject to flooding and sea level rise.

Advantages

Disadvantages

Provide a barrier to protect the foundation of a building 
or other structure from wave action or other form of 
rapidly moving water. 
The presence of erosion/scour protection provides two 
secondary messages:
•  a vivid and constant public reminder to passers-by that 

the site is subject to flooding or inundation risks; and 

•  a reminder that adaptation measures have taken place.

Aesthetic disadvantages include the often harsh 
appearance of the erosion/scour protection. This can 
often be mitigated by providing an erodible top to cover 
the scour protection or provide a more gradual grade 
away from the building. 
Where services are provided to a building, the erosion/
scour protection will only protect services within the 
scour protection area, not the services beyond.
Costs can be significant and include designing, 
transporting, installing and maintaining erosion/scour 
protection. 

2. Structural Elevation

Tool Description
Structural elevation can be achieved in several ways, including: raising the ground elevation with the 
placement of structural fill; raising the elevation of habitable areas within a building; or raising the entire 
building by using stilts, foundation walls or similar elevating structures. This tool is mainly used for new 
construction but can also apply to a major addition or retrofit. This tool is also sometimes referred to as 
super elevation or dry floodproofing.

Application
This tool can reduce the risk of damage to buildings and infrastructure by raising their elevation. The 
increase in elevation above the natural ground level can be determined through a risk assessment by a 
qualified professional or in accordance with local government requirements, guidelines or policy. In rural 
areas, this tool typically involves the use of fill to raise the elevation of a house or other buildings above a 
flood plain or other flood hazard. In urban areas where lot areas are smaller, this tool may involve creating 
non-habitable space (crawl space or cellar) in areas subject to flooding. A combination of fill and building 
design changes may be used for new development on a neighbourhood level or for infill redevelopment 
within an existing area. 

62

Structural Tools (Flood Protection Works)In B.C., the authority for structural elevation is most clearly stated in Section 910 of the Local Government 
Act. If a local government considers that flooding may occur on a piece of land, the local government may 
adopt a bylaw requiring a minimum elevation for the underside of a floor system of a house on that land. 
Such a bylaw must consider the provincial guidelines, which take sea level rise and related impacts  
into account.

The standard of protection varies from province to province. In British Columbia, the design standard of 
protection is for a 1 in 200 year return period. This means the elevation of buildings should be raised to 
withstand a flood with an annual probability of 0.5% or a 1 in 200 year flood. In B.C. the minimum elevation 
for habitable construction is called the Flood Construction Level (FCL). This is the minimum elevation of 
the underside of a wooden floor system or the top of a concrete slab for habitable buildings. The Flood 
Construction Level typically includes an additional vertical distance (freeboard) of 0.3 metres to 0.6 metres 
to the calculated flood level to accommodate uncertainties in flood levels. There is a relationship between 
the standard of protection and resulting risk. If the design standard is reduced to withstand a flood with  
an annual probability of 1.0%, the cost of protective measures will decrease but the risk increases.

Flood construction requirements in Atlantic Canada may reference a minimum elevation above sea level 
datum, geodetic datum or protection for a 1 in 100 year return period or a 50 year design standard. In 
Newfoundland and Labrador, the design standard is based on a flood event with a 1 in 100 year return 
period. The other Atlantic Provinces rely on generally accepted coastal engineering design standards for the 
life of structures in coastal areas of 50 years. A notable exception is the Confederation Bridge between New 
Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, which was built a metre higher to account for sea level rise over the 100 
year design life of the project.

Evaluation and Governance Considerations
Economic – The cost of structural elevation depends on a numbers of factors, one of which is the cost of 
fill. The affected site area will include the building footprint area plus a sloped area for the fill, typically at 
a 3:1 slope, to return to the natural ground level. Alternatively, a retaining wall or other structure could be 
used to reduce or eliminate the sloped area. The amount of fill could be substantial. For a 1 metre elevation 
rise to accommodate a two storey building with 200 m² of living area and a building footprint of 10 metres 
by 10 metres plus a 3:1 slope back to the natural elevation, nearly 200 m² of fill would be required. For a 
2 metre elevation rise, the amount of fill would increase to over 500 m². If a lesser amount of fill is used 
without reducing the Flood Construction Level, the building could be designed without livable space on 
the ground level. This often takes the form of a crawl space with a low ceiling height, a garage, an entry 
foyer, laundry room or a small storage area. Electrical outlets would have to be raised and a furnace located 
above the Flood Construction Level.

The key economic consideration is the cost of reducing the risk through structural elevation. The cost of 
providing public infrastructure93 (roads, bridges) in an area at risk is another economic consideration that 
will increase over time. The cost of floodproofing can also be compared to the cost of development in an 
area without risk of coastal flooding or inundation.

Environmental – This tool primarily addresses the protection of buildings and property.  Environmental 
impacts will be more significant where a large area is subject to fill placement, such as previously 
undeveloped areas, wetlands and other natural areas. The cost of floodproofing can also be compared  
to the cost of development in an area without risk of coastal flooding or inundation.

93  Critical infrastructure includes all the services that support development in an area subject to the risk of flooding.

63

Structural Tools (Flood Protection Works)Social – This tool primarily minimises risk to building inhabitants and structures themselves. Social 
considerations include the visual impact, which increases as the amount of structural elevation increases. 
For a single family dwelling or townhouse, there is a risk the owner may convert a crawl space or non-
habitable space below the Flood Construction Level to a living area after building occupancy has been 
obtained. This is most likely to occur where the cost of housing is high.

Implementation Measures and Challenges 
Structural elevation measures are typically required as a condition of building approval. Structural elevation 
measures can be implemented after a building is constructed but incur greater costs. The challenges increase 
depending on the amount of elevation rise required and the site. A large structural elevation rise on a small 
property may not be feasible. The aesthetics of having elevated and non-elevated structures in the same 
community may be a drawback if the elevation change is significant. 

Providing access for persons with disabilities poses an additional challenge. The structural elevation of 
heritage buildings also poses a particular challenge.

Advantages

Disadvantages

By raising the habitable floor elevation to a specified 
design flood event, the risk of flood damage can be 
measurably reduced. 
Structural elevation enhances resilience by providing  
a secondary means of protection where dikes provide  
the first line of defence. 
One indirect impact of structural elevation is greater 
awareness of sea level rise. Although architectural design 
can address visual impact to some extent, a major change 
in elevation for a dwelling or other habitable structure 
serves as a vivid and constant public reminder that 
flooding is a risk that must be addressed. 
Structural elevation is not a permanent solution, as  
sea levels will continue to rise, but may last the lifetime  
of the building.

The cost associated with raising the elevation of 
a building can be considerable. The cost will vary 
depending on the size of the building floor plate, the 
building design and the amount of elevation rise to 
reach the design requirements. Estimated additional 
building costs for new construction may range from 3% 
to 30%. Associated costs may include additional steps or 
handicapped accessibility provisions.
There is a limit to the amount of structural elevation 
which can occur. As structural elevation requirements 
increase (i.e., become higher), the increase in cost is 
geometric, not arithmetic. 
The placement of fill to raise the ground level may not be 
aesthetically attractive if the elevation change is large. 
This is particularly evident on small infill lots. 

3. Dikes

Tool Description
A dike is commonly a linear compacted earthfill structure intended to protect a designated area from 
inundation caused by high water conditions on an adjacent watercourse or floodplain.94 Dikes typically 
form the key defense element in a protect strategy. The primary function of a dike is to prevent the 
inundation of coastal lowlands from the sea under extreme conditions. Sea dikes typically have a flatter 
gradient on the seaward side, for the purpose of dissipating wave energy. This is not necessary on the 
landward side where a steeper gradient is typical to reduce land requirements. In addition, a sea dike will 
typically have toe scour protection consisting of riprap and an under layer of filter rock or geotextile to 
prevent it from being undermined.

64

Structural Tools (Flood Protection Works)It is important to recognize that, because agricultural land can tolerate some overtopping, the construction 
elevations and design of earthen dikes to protect agricultural land may be lower than for the protection of 
life and property. Depending on the province and location, municipalities may have no control over private 
agricultural dikes within their boundaries. They are not financially responsible for repairs to such dikes but 
may be affected by the impacts of a dike breach.

Application
Recent research,95 has resulted in a re-evaluation of the vulnerability of communities to flooding due to 
storm surges and wave action. In B.C., a 2012 study indicated the need for a higher dike crest elevation 
for over 250 km of shoreline in the Lower Mainland study area, most of which is protected by dikes. The 
increased risk is due to a combination of sea level rise as well as an increased provision for storm surges  
and wave run-up and seismic considerations.

Dikes are typically designed by a qualified professional in accordance with local and provincial 
regulations and guidelines. In B.C., there are various applicable provincial documents, including the 
recent Climate Change Adaptation Guidelines for Sea Dikes and Coastal Flood Hazard Land Use,96 which 
are divided into three volumes: Draft Policy Discussion Paper, Sea Dike Guidelines and Guidelines for 
Management of Coastal Flood Hazard Land Use. There are numerous technical publications which 
provide guidance on engineering design.

Assets protected by dikes can include infrastructure and agricultural lands. Both New Brunswick and 
Nova Scotia have legislation to protect agricultural land and to create marsh bodies, although not all 
development that has taken place in low-lying areas is behind a dike or protected by this mandate. In  
New Brunswick, the legislation is referred to as the Marshland Reclamation Act (O.C. 82-14). Nova Scotia 
has been more progressive, updating the Marshland Reclamation Act of 1989 with numerous amendments 
through the Agricultural Marshland Conservation Act (c.22, s.1, amended 2004). 

New Brunswick has 37,000 acres of marshland protected from the tidal waters of the Bay of Fundy. Some 
of this land is protected by a variety of earthen infrastructure (including dikes) constructed over 300 years 
ago. Much of the earthen infrastructure was constructed in the early 1950s and is currently maintained by 
the N.B. Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Aquaculture.

Structural Tools (Flood Protection Works)In British Columbia approval to construct dikes and other hard protection must be obtained from the 
province under the Water Act and the Dike Maintenance Act and, where applicable, from the federal 
government under the Fisheries Act and the Environmental Assessment Act.

The Nova Scotia Department of Agriculture has a mandate to protect agricultural land behind dikes in 
the Annapolis Basin, Upper Bay of Fundy and other regions of the province. The Department is currently 
responsible for tidal dike maintenance, while landowners are responsible for maintenance of internal dike 
roads and the acquisition of land required for the reconstruction of dikes. Historically, earthen dikes have 
been used to protect this land. These dikes have been raised to maintain a minimum critical elevation 
relative to tide levels. Many dikes were originally built by the Acadians 300 years ago and were upgraded 
in the 1950s. In 2000, the provincial Agricultural Marshland Conservation Act was passed to protect these 
soils for future generations. It is thought that a majority of the diked land is at risk from rising sea levels and 
storm surge.97 Under a joint Atlantic Regional Adaptation Collaboration project with New Brunswick, a 2012 
GIS assessment of dike vulnerability based on LiDAR data in the Tantramar marshlands area concluded 
that the region was at immediate risk of flooding.98 With an average height of 8.9 metres, the vast majority 
of dikes (89%) would be overtopped with a frequency of 1:10 years (i.e. once in 10 years). This would 
potentially flood over 20% of Sackville during a storm surge.

Evaluation and Governance Considerations
Economic – Economic considerations include: 
•  The cost of new dike construction where a dike is not present; 
•  The cost to accommodate a higher dike due to sea level rise; 
•  The structural stability of the new dike; and
•  The ongoing cost of dike maintenance; and land acquisition to accommodate the land base for the dike 

and road access for maintenance and emergency management purposes.

Where an increased dike height is involved, the economic, social and environmental implications of a 
seaward versus a landward expansion must be examined. Hard protection measures tend to be expensive 
(in the order of thousands of dollars per metre for revetments and dikes). The standard for flood protection 
measures (i.e., Flood Construction Level for current sea level vs. projections for 2050 or 2100) will have 
a critical impact on the economic costs. Given the cost implications, it is anticipated that greater use of 
hybrid techniques such as living shorelines will occur and increased attention will be given to retreat 
and avoid strategies. The capital and operating costs of dikes may limit their implementation to selected 
locations, such as densely populated areas, areas with high natural or cultural importance, and high value 
infrastructure.

Funding for dike upgrades requires a large capital outlay, and requires approval by different levels of 
government. Intermittent funding programs may not be appropriate where the need for upgrades  
is ongoing and long-term. It may be difficult to obtain public acceptance depending on the capital costs 
and the distribution of those costs, especially if property views are impacted.

same time: anomalistic, synodical and tropical monthly cycles.

Structural Tools (Flood Protection Works)Sea dike upgrade costing study, Metro Vancouver, British Columbia99 

In 2011 the Province of  British Columbia published a Climate Change Adaptation Guidelines for 
Sea Dikes and Coastal Flood Hazard Land Use (Ausenco Sandwell, 2011), which defined sea level 
rise planning levels and flood protection requirements. The guidelines propose an updated design 
methodology for coastal flood protection measures, including new design criteria for sea level rise, 
subsidence, storm surge and wave effects. 

To gain a greater understanding of what implications the new guidelines would have on the ground, 
the B.C. Ministry of Forests, Lands and Natural Resource Operations commissioned a study to develop 
a ‘Class D’ estimate of the cost to adapt flood protection to meet the rise in sea level predicted by 
2100. The study covered the Metro Vancouver coastal shoreline and the Fraser River shoreline as far 
east as the Port Mann Bridge, some 250 km of shoreline and dikes in total. Within this area both diked 
shorelines and low-lying areas that may require protection as sea level rises were considered.

The report calculated the full costs of establishing flood protection for seismic stabilization of the 
diking system and the sea level rise projected to take place by 2100, including land acquisition, 
engineering, environmental design, relocation of utilities, and upgrading of pump stations and other 
associated works. The total estimated cost was $9,470 million, including a 50% contingency factor.  
The estimated cost for sea level rise alone, including associated infrastructure and property acquisition 
was $2,810 million. 

99
Environmental – Environmental impacts include the lost intertidal areas from the seaward expansion of a 
dike, or of agricultural and open space areas where a landward expansion is involved. The presence of dikes 
impedes natural shoreline migration – an adaptive response of coastal habitats to rising sea levels.

Social – Social implications include the loss of housing due to land acquisition, impacts on views and loss 
of community amenities in and around dikes.

Dikes provide some assurance of land stability and therefore tend to promote shoreline development. 
Unless such structures are designed to meet a long-range design standard, they can lead to a false sense of 
security. If Flood Construction Levels and setbacks are not increased due to sea level rise and other climate 
change effects, the level of protection provided by a dike will gradually decrease over time. 

Hard protection methods have a long history of successful use, although in the rare instance of failure, the 
consequences can be very severe. Dikes can also provide a secure corridor, such as a road or trail, and often 
enhance recreation value.

Implementation Measures and Challenges 
Apart from the high costs for construction, dike implementation measures require land acquisition for the 
linear corridor occupied by the dike as well as access for maintenance and emergency measures. The linear 
corridor may affect numerous landowners and may require the relocation or removal of other structures. 
There are often environmental and social issues as outlined above.

Structural Tools (Flood Protection Works)Advantages

Disadvantages

Dikes can be engineered to provide a reasonably high 
level of protection, if adequately maintained.
Dikes can provide protection for high value development 
and maintain or enhance property values. 
Dikes have the secondary effect of containing internal 
drainage on the land side, requiring it to be discharged 
through floodbox structures that can be closed at high 
sea levels, and pumped or opened to release water at low 
tides. This can also be a disadvantage.
The dike crest may be available for use as a recreation 
corridor.

4. Other Hard Protection

Dikes are expensive to construct and can be unsightly. 
They may restrict access to the shore and reduce the 
recreational value of a shoreline. 
Dikes may cause erosion to adjacent unprotected areas. 
Dikes and revetments tend to absorb wave energy and 
therefore will be subject to damage and will require 
ongoing maintenance and investment.
Dikes can result in a loss of intertidal areas and impede 
natural shoreline migration. 

Tool Description
There are several types of other hard protection structures commonly used within a coastal context. 

Groynes are rigid structures typically constructed of riprap or other heavy material extending from the 
upper foreshore or beach into the water. They are located perpendicular to the shore or at a slightly oblique 
angle. Groynes are used to dissipate wave energy, trap the movement of sediment along an intertidal area 
and reduce the seaward transport of sediment (this may cause erosion on one side and accretion on the 
other). They function by realigning short sections of the shore with respect to the incoming waves.

Breakwaters are rigid structures typically constructed parallel to the coast for the purpose of reducing the 
amount of wave energy reaching the shore. A perched beach retained by a submerged structure may be 
considered a subset of this category.

Offshore breakwaters may also be called bulkheads. They are designed to reduce the intensity of wave 
action in inshore waters and thereby reduce coastal erosion or provide safe harborage. Breakwaters may 
also be small structures placed offshore in relatively shallow water designed to protect a gently sloping 
beach or a vertical retaining wall designed to hold and prevent soil from sliding seaward. 

Seawalls are typically vertical concrete or rock structures constructed to provide protection against erosion 
and flooding. Seawalls are built parallel to the shore and generally have a deep foundation for stability.

Structural Tools (Flood Protection Works)Revetments are covers or facings which provide erosion resistance to a sloped surface. They can be 
concrete, timber, armour rock (riprap), gabions and other materials. The terms seawalls and revetments  
can, on occasion, be used interchangeably.

Floodwalls are vertical structural barriers, typically constructed of concrete, and designed for use in 
confined areas over short distances to prevent flooding. 

Storm Surge and Tidal Barriers consist of hard engineered protection with movable or fixed barriers/gates 
which are closed to prevent flooding when extreme water levels are forecast. 

Application
Groynes are typically used to impede the drift of sediment along a beach. Their effectiveness depends 
upon a supply of sand and the existence of longshore sediment transport. They are often constructed  
as a series of structures and may be used in combination with beach nourishment.

Breakwaters are used to protect marinas, ports, harbours and other shoreline infrastructure from storm 
surges and wave action.

Seawalls are most often used to dissipate wave energy, as well as flooding and erosion in constrained 
coastal areas. This may occur where the land drops off sharply on the seaward side or where the cost of land 
acquisition for a dike is prohibitive. A seawall provides a firm boundary between the land and the sea and 
provides protection up to the design height of the seawall. Seawalls are typically in place where available 
space is constrained due to physical or cost factors. 

Floodwalls are typically used in locations where space is limited and where land uses and values are very 
high. Floodwalls are used where the use of a dike or other lesser cost structure is precluded, due to conflicts 
with buildings and other land uses. 

Storm Surge Barriers are constructed across river estuaries and are equipped with gates that can be closed 
in the event of a storm surge.100 They are most commonly used to protect tidal inlets and estuaries. Their 
primary function is to prevent coastal flooding, but they can shorten the length of defences behind the 
barrier. Water is discharged through or pumped over the barrier depending on the applicable conditions.

Structural Tools (Flood Protection Works)Evaluation and Governance Considerations
Economic – Considerations related to these measures are similar to those of dikes. Groynes, breakwaters 
and storm surge barriers also involve high construction costs. For all hard protection, an engineering 
analysis should be undertaken with respect to capital and operating costs as well as risk and impact 
mitigation. 

Environmental – Considerations are similar to those for dikes except for the linear corridor requirements 
of a dike. Groynes, breakwaters and storm surge barriers may cause negative environmental impacts and 
transfer risk onto nearby properties.

Social – Criteria are similar to those of dikes. 

Implementation Measures and Challenges 
Implementation of any form of hard protection will, in most cases, involve large costs and funding. Apart 
from the construction costs implementation of hard protection measures may require land acquisition and 
authorized access to undertake maintenance and emergency measures. A particular challenge affecting 
the implementation of a groyne is the potential to transfer risk from one riparian property to another or 
create a negative economic, social or environmental impact.

Example: Sept-Îles, qC hard protection challenges 

In the municipality of Sept-Îles in Quebec, measures to protect against erosion have primarily involved 
riprap structures constructed and paid for by the municipality, sometimes with assistance from the 
Province or private property owners. Property owners require a permit before such measures can be 
implemented, however, many have built riprap structures without permits over the years. 

The result is a patch-work mix of varying quality and integrity. The riprap installed in the bay to protect 
the downtown core from flooding has held up well over the years and appears to be doing its job. The 
bay is relatively protected from winds; some waves do not hit the rocks with as much force as in other 
areas. It has been observed in the areas that extend out from the bay that riprap structures appear to 
have contributed to increasing erosion particularly in the gap areas where the structures are not as well 
constructed or are absent. 

For this reason, in 2000, municipal officials requested that the province conduct detailed research on 
erosion in the area. As a result of this research, all structural measures, save for adding sand to the 
banks, have been prohibited since 2005.

Structural Tools (Flood Protection Works)Advantages

Disadvantages

Many forms of hard structural protection can be 
engineered to provide a reasonably high level of 
dependability, if adequately maintained.
Hard structural protection can provide protection for 
high value development or natural areas and maintain or 
increase property values. 
A seawall may be available for use as a recreation corridor. 
The Stanley Park seawall in Vancouver is an example of an 
outstanding success with major recreation and economic 
spin-off benefits.

Structural measures to protect against erosion in one 
place can increase erosion elsewhere. This situation may 
occur where incoming waves approach the shoreline at 
an angle causing sediment to move along the shoreline 
until blocked by a groyne.
A groyne offers limited protection against extreme events 
and may negatively impact adjacent riparian areas. 
A seawall or floodwall reflects more wave energy, which 
may cause localized erosion at the toe and require a deep 
foundation.
Seawalls and other hard protection structures are 
expensive to construct and maintain, can be unsightly 
and restrict shore access.

5. Wet Floodproofing

Tool Description
Wet floodproofing consists of measures which allow water to enter and exit a structure with minimal 
damage. Wet floodproofing involves the use of flood resistant materials, the elevation of electrical and 
mechanical services and the use of openings for drainage. This tool is distinguished from dry floodproofing 
which aims to make a building watertight or impermeable to an expected flood.

Application
Wet floodproofing has limited applicability and is not commonly used. It may be used for existing 
developments with small land parcels built where infrastructure is slightly below the established Flood 
Construction Level. A commercial storefront abutting a sidewalk that is at an elevation subject to flooding 
has few alternatives if the building has no setback from the property line. Wet floodproofing may be a 
viable alternative to elevating an existing residential property on a small lot above the floodplain.

Wet floodproofing may be used where the area subject to flooding is not used for habitable purposes, these 
may include vehicle parking areas and areas used for the storage of goods not damageable by floodwaters.

71

Structural Tools (Flood Protection Works)Evaluation and Governance Considerations
Economic – Economic considerations include the cost of installing or retrofitting flood-resistant materials, 
and constructing or retrofitting electrical and other services damageable by floodwaters at a higher 
elevation. Adequately sized openings must be provided to equalize hydrostatic pressure. Owners must be 
willing to experience a temporary loss of use of areas subject to flooding and must ensure damageable 
goods are not located in areas subject to flooding.

Environmental – Environmental implications of this tool are minimal.

Social – Wet flood proofing may reduce the risk of flooding to people and buildings. Post-flood recovery 
time may be rapid compared to flooding of buildings without flood resistant materials. 

Implementation Measures and Challenges 
Implementation involves the use of flood-resistant materials, as well as the strategic placement and 
use of building openings and the electrical, mechanical, heating and ventilation equipment. A detailed 
list of flood-resistant materials and their application has been published by the US Federal Emergency 
Management Agency based on destructive testing by the US Army Corps of Engineers. Challenges include 
the cost of implementation and the limited circumstances in which wet floodproofing is applicable for 
long-term adaptation to Sea Level Rise.

Advantages

Disadvantages

Can reduce the time and cost of cleanup after a flood.
Wet floodproofing can be less costly than other retrofits 
as no additional land is required and the appearance of 
the building is minimally affected.
Allowing water to enter and exit a building may be a  
cost-effective alternative to dry floodproofing.
A wide range of water resistant materials can be used at  
a reasonable cost.

Wet floodproofing has limited applicability and appeal  
for sea level rise.
Clean-up is still required post-flood.
A residential building will be uninhabitable during  
a flood; other accommodation has to be provided. 
Goods may be damaged by floodwaters if they cannot  
be moved to higher ground.

Structural Tools (Flood Protection Works)Non-Structural (Soft Armouring)

1. Coastal Wetland Creation or Restoration

Tool Description
Wetlands are some of the most ecologically important and vulnerable coastal habitats. Coastal wetlands 
are found in the “transition zone” between land and sea, and have both upland and aquatic characteristics. 
As a result, they are extremely productive ecosystems and often have a richer flora and fauna than other 
environments.102 Functionally, coastal wetlands assist with wave and tidal dissipation, and their vegetation 
and root systems act as a trap for sediments, facilitating accretion and reducing erosion. In the absence of a 
barrier to migration, if a wetland or salt marsh is losing area on its seaward side, it is likely claiming area on 
its landward side. This adaptive ability contrasts sharply with traditional human-made coastal defences that 
are static and typically require the continuous input of resources.103 The most commonly restored coastal 
wetland ecosystems are salt marshes.

Application
On the seaward side, this tool can be used as part of a protect or accommodate strategy. On the landward 
side, wetland creation can be part of an avoid strategy or provide a transitional land use as part of a long-
term strategy of managed retreat. This tool does not apply to rocky coastlines or where the ocean depth 
drops rapidly.

Enabling Legislation
There is no specific legislation governing wetland restoration although the Federal Species at Risk Act may 
apply. Wetland creation may be facilitated through Environment Canada’s Ecological Gifts Program. 

To effectively manage and conserve wetlands, the New Brunswick Provincial Government developed a 
Wetlands Conservation Policy. The policy, approved in 2002, had two main objectives: (1) the maintenance 
of wetland function and (2) the securement, stewardship, education and awareness of wetlands. 
Subsequently, parts of the policy were dropped after complaints from some businesses and landowners 
that it was too restrictive.

Evaluation and Governance Considerations
Economic – Considerations include the economic benefit of reduced flood risk to people and property, the 
cost of securing the land (which includes land covered by water) through a foreshore lease or other means, 
the cost of creating or restoring the land and the cost for long-term management. Environment Canada’s 
Ecological Gifts Program, through which a landowner donates ecological sensitive land and receives a tax 
benefit, may be of assistance, although this program does not apply to existing intertidal areas, which are 
owned by the Crown throughout Canada.

Consultants Inc.)

Environmental – Environmental considerations include the environmental benefit of the wetland creation 
or restoration such as new or enhanced habitat for fish and shellfish and improved water quality.

Social – Passive recreational activities, such as bird watching and interpretive opportunities, may 
complement the creation of coastal wetlands. Passive recreational features include elevated walkways, at 
grade walkways subject to periodic flooding, blinds and waterfowl observation towers for naturalists. In 
conjunction with other tools, wetland creation may reduce the land requirements for linear protection.

Implementation Measures and Challenges 
Like any tool, the appropriateness of wetland or salt marsh restoration must be evaluated on a site-by-site 
basis. Understanding the biophysical conditions under which restoration is being considered is particularly 
important as these may ultimately determine the long-term sustainability of a restored wetland or marsh.104 
Implementation measures include land acquisition, foreshore lease, covenant or other form of protection. 
An assessment of the area by a Registered Professional Biologist or other qualified professional should 
take place. Financial resources are required to undertake the necessary investment to create or restore 
the wetland; and an organization such as a land trust may be required to manage the wetland. Challenges 
include acquiring the wetland area (i.e., tenure from a private land owner), securing the necessary funds 
and undertaking long-term maintenance.

74

Non-Structural Tools (Soft Armouring)Advantages

Disadvantages

For a protect strategy, space requirements in areas with 
existing development or high development potential 
may have attendant high acquisition costs.
A lack of public awareness of the flood and erosion 
protection benefits offered by these environments can  
be a potential barrier to implementation.
Wetland creation is not feasible in many areas due to 
unsuitable bathymetric conditions or excessive erosion.

The main benefit is the reduction of incoming wave and 
tidal energy through dissipation in the intertidal zone. 
Coastal wetlands or salt marshes are cost effective relative 
to static man-made coastal defence structures.108
Wetlands can help reduce coastal flooding and stabilize 
shorelines. 
Wetlands can provide highly productive new habitat and 
environmental benefits.
Coastal wetlands have capacity to improve water quality 
and fishing in coastal waters by providing vital breeding 
and nursery grounds for fish and shellfish.
Provided wetlands are not subjected to coastal squeeze 
and that the rate of sea level rise is not too rapid to keep 
pace, wetlands are capable of adapting to sea level rise 
without further intervention or investment.

2. Dune Building or Rehabilitation

Tool Description
Naturally occurring dunes are wind-formed sand deposits representing a store of sediment in the zone 
just landward of normal high tides. They typically occur along wide sandy coastlines, and are dynamic and 
constantly moving. Natural sand dunes provide an effective defence against coastal erosion and flooding 
by dissipating incoming wave energy from a storm surge, wave run-up or extreme high tide. Dunes form a 
barrier similar in function to a seawall but are more dynamic, as they have the ability to adjust in response 
to changes in wind and wave climate or sea level. 

Artificial dunes are engineered structures created to mimic the function of natural dunes. At its simplest, 
artificial dune construction involves placing sediment from dredged sources and shaping them to form 
dunes.106 Dune rehabilitation refers to the restoration of natural or artificial dunes in order to gain the 
greatest coastal protection. Both natural and artificial dunes can be stabilized through vegetation planting; 
vegetation roots help stabilize the dune. Historically, sand dunes have often been removed or altered, 
either because they represent an economical source of construction materials or are a barrier to coastal 
access or views. Naturally occurring dunes have often been seen as conflicting with human settlement as 
these same coastlines are often the most desirable places for development. 

Application
Dunes occur very infrequently along the west coast of B.C. but are more common on the east coast of 
Vancouver Island and the east side of Graham Island in Haida Gwaii. They occur more frequently in Quebec 
and Atlantic Canada, particularly in P.E.I. They are found most frequently along wide sandy coastlines and 
may be used in combination with beach nourishment. 

Dune creation or restoration requires compatible sediment. Vegetative planting or fences may be used 
to stabilize an artificial dune. A 2011 project by the Souris Wildlife Federation on the causeway at Souris, 
P.E.I. has installed snow fencing and spruce boughs in an effort to trap sand to build up the dunes to help 
protect against future storm surges.

Evaluation and Governance Considerations
Economic – Economic considerations include the availability and cost of sand, the cost of equipment, the 
frequency with which dunes need to be replenished and the cost of the land or foreshore lease required  
to accommodate dune building.

Environmental – Dune creation and protection is one of the limited number of tools likely to have a 
positive environmental impact (e.g., increased habitat in limited supply, tool that works with nature).

Social – On one hand, creating dunes on the landward side may result in a loss of land for existing residents 
and property owners. Loss of views and direct access to coastal areas may affect existing residents. On 
the other hand, opportunities for passive recreation could increase. Implementation could serve as a 
community education process about non-structural measures used in adapting to sea level rise. Creating 
dunes on the ocean side may not be feasible.

Implementation Measures and Challenges 
Implementation requires an area (land or foreshore) to be set aside, a source of sand to create or 
rehabilitate dunes, equipment to move and shape sand into a dune, and funding sources for capital 
and ongoing maintenance. Key challenges include the availability of suitable material, the cost of 
implementation and maintenance, the equitable allocation of project costs between benefiting property 
owners and society as a whole, and obtaining public support. 

As an example of potential challenges, Sept-Îles in Quebec has a regulation107 banning all structural 
protection for private property owners, except for sandbanks. Construction of these banks requires a 
provincial permit which the Province will not presently issue to individuals, a challenge to the cohesive  
use of this tool.

erosion risk zones along the St. Lawrence and for certain river estuaries in the RCM of Sept-Rivières). Adopted in 2005, dated in 2010.

76

Non-Structural Tools (Soft Armouring)Advantages

Disadvantages

Dunes can be used to provide an effective defence 
against coastal flooding and erosion by maintaining wide 
sandy beaches, which dissipate wave energy, and can 
serve as a store of sediment, which can be accessed in 
order to satisfy erosional forces. 
Dune protection can meet multiple objectives, including 
environmental enhancement and protection, public and 
recreational access, and hazard reduction. 
Dunes can be created in a sensitive manner by taking into 
account the environment in which they are placed. Dunes 
and the vegetation of dunes can provide an important 
environmental benefit by creating or increasing valuable 
coastal habitat for species at risk. 

Dunes, especially artificial dunes, can be perceived as a 
barrier to beach access, and a dune creation proposal 
may run into community opposition. While providing 
protection from erosion, dunes may conflict with 
residential or tourism purposes where the concern is 
maintaining “sea views”. Dune development may be 
seen as an opportunity to encourage additional coastal 
development at risk from sea level rise.
Dunes are not static like hard forms of protection. They 
are dynamic and constantly evolving, and therefore 
require careful long-term management.
Dunes as an sea level rise adaptation tool have limited 
applicability since sandy shorelines and suitable material 
are not present in many areas. As well, the bathymetry 
near the shoreline may not be suitable for the use of this 
tool. Dunes may require a large footprint, which may have 
significant cost implications.

3. Beach Nourishment

Tool Description
Beach nourishment refers to the addition of sand or other similar beach sediment material to satisfy the 
erosional forces of natural wave action and prevent shoreline erosion. As waves run up on a beach, they 
lose energy and are dissipated; the more beach (or similar surface), the more energy is dissipated. By 
adding a sediment supply, the beach is maintained at a width that provides storm protection and acts as a 
buffer. The cross-sectional shape of a beach affects its ability to dissipate wave energy: a wide and shallow 
beach will attenuate wave energy more effectively than a steep and narrow beach. 

Beach nourishment reduces the detrimental effects of coastal erosion by providing additional sediment 
to satisfy the natural forces of erosion. Beach nourishment will not stop erosion; however, it will provide 
a sacrificial element against coastal erosion, rather than a hard barrier. Beach nourishment will likely be 
required on an ongoing basis as long as the forces of erosion are present.108 

Application
Beach nourishment can use sediment material dredged from the ocean, or material barged, trucked, 
moved by heavy equipment or by a conveyor belt from a land-based source. The rate of erosion needs to 
be monitored on a regular basis, typically by a cross-sectional analysis. If the available beach material drops 
below to a critical level, re-nourishment will be required to avoid further erosion and damage to coastal 
infrastructure. A sediment budget is used to describe the measurement of migrating and eroding sediment 
in a manner similar to the measurement of river bed aggradation. 

Because of annual sand erosion from the dunes and beaches in the area, a beach nourishment program has 
been in place at Parlee Beach (near Shediac, N.B.) since 2009. It is expected that this will become an annual 
program with a portion of the park entrance fee ($3) used to help pay for the program.

108 

(Linham and Nicholls 2010)

77

Non-Structural Tools (Soft Armouring)Evaluation and Governance Considerations
Economic – Economic considerations include the availability and cost of acquiring, moving and placing 
sand or other suitable beach material on an eroded shoreline. The allocation of costs between individual 
benefiting property owners and the community as a whole may need to be addressed.

Beach nourishment may offer economic benefits as an alternative to or in combination with other forms  
of structural protection. 

Environmental – Beach nourishment may enhance intertidal areas. However, negative effects could 
occur if the material deposited does not match the size and composition of native beach material, if the 
deposited material provides excessive turbidity or if the depth of material deposited buries existing marine 
organisms. 

Social – Social benefits include reduced risk and enhanced property values for waterfront properties, and 
increased use of beach nourishment areas by the public for recreational purposes. 

Implementation Measures and Challenges 
Engineering studies over an extended time period are required to determine the rate and extent of 
shoreline erosion and the volume of beach nourishment required to address the sediment deficit. For  
large-scale beach nourishment applications specialized equipment must be used. Ongoing monitoring  
will be required to evaluate the success of the beach nourishment and when additional beach nourishment 
is required.

Challenges include the cost of implementation, supply limitations, lack of specialized equipment and 
expertise, the need for public education and recognition that the job is never finished. 

Advantages

Disadvantages

Beach nourishment provides sacrificial material to be 
eroded, effectively protecting landward areas from wave 
action.
This tool may provide an alternative to the use of hard 
protection such as groynes which can disrupt natural 
processes of sediment supply to a beach.
Beach nourishment can enhance the value of beaches by 
providing a more aesthetically appealing environment.
As sediment is redistributed by the natural forces or 
erosion, it may also have a positive effect on adjacent 
areas not directly nourished.
Beach nourishment may address multiple objectives, 
including environmental enhancement and protection, 
public and recreational access, and hazard reduction.

The use of beach nourishment is subject to a number of 
widespread limitations, including a consistent supply of 
correctly sized sediment for the long-term and a suitable 
foreshore profile.
Beach nourishment can become prohibitively expensive 
if a supply of sediment is not readily available.
The value of aggregate resources including sand is highly 
dependent on the proximity of supply sources to the 
locations in which they are needed.
Beach nourishment is not a permanent solution to 
shoreline erosion. It will require regular monitoring  
and periodic re-nourishment depending on the rate  
of erosion that takes place.
Beach nourishment may affect the productivity of 
intertidal areas.

Non-Structural Tools (Soft Armouring)Combinations & Compatibility

Combinations & Compatibility

The 21 tools in this primer have been organized into five broad categories: planning, regulatory, land use 
change or restriction, structural and non-structural. These five categories are intended to assist decision 
makers in the selection, application and combination of these tools.

Several of the tools are interdependent and should be used in combination, producing hybrid shoreline 
protection systems. At first glance, structural and non-structural adaptation tools may appear to represent 
opposing approaches; however, they are often used in combination. Non-structural tools, sometimes referred 
to as soft armouring or soft engineering, offer flexibility and can reduce the costs of construction and negative 
environmental effects incurred by using structural tools alone.

Hybrid techniques from P.E.I.

Hybrid techniques were implemented at the Crowbush Golf Course on P.E.I. after a major storm surge in 
December, 2004. At Crowbush Cove, a low-lying armour stone base, known as a revetment, was installed 
parallel to the shoreline. Sand was placed on top of the revetment to re-establish the dune in the area, 
and marram grass was re-seeded on the dune to help with stabilization. After storm events, removed 
sand must be replaced. The same type of system was installed on the Panmure Island Causeway.

80

The tools in this primer, individually or in combination, may be used to meet the four overall strategies 
for adaptation to sea level rise. These strategies are not “pure” approaches or mutually exclusive; in fact, a 
local government may undertake different strategies for different areas following an analysis of the varying 
conditions. A protect strategy may be suitable for an historic area where all buildings and infrastructure 
would be frequently inundated without the installation of linear structural protection such as a dike. 
An accommodate strategy may apply to a new development at the margins of an area at risk of coastal 
flooding. An avoid strategy may be applied to prevent a proposed new residential development or a large 
commercial or institutional development in a previously undeveloped area at risk of flooding. Finally, a 
retreat strategy may be suitable for a rural area where the Flood Construction Level is an entire floor above 
the ground elevation. 

Over time, the choice of strategy for the same area may change due to changing circumstances, risk 
assessment or availability of resources. For example, a protect strategy relying on dikes alone may represent 
the historic approach in a particular area. With a new risk analysis, an accommodate strategy might evolve 
in which all new development is required to provide scour protection and floodproofing of buildings.

The following Compatibility Matrix shows the 21 different adaptation tools and how they relate to the 
four overall adaptation strategies. Some tools are recommended for all strategies, while other tools may 
or may not be appropriate to a particular strategy. For instance, a land trust would not be applicable to a 
protect strategy, but would be compatible with all other strategies.

Living Shorelines 

Living shorelines, also termed soft stabilization shoreline alternatives, refer to the management of coastal 
areas in ways that protect, restore, enhance or create natural shoreline habitat. Living shorelines employ a 
suite of techniques to minimize coastal erosion and maintain coastal processes. These include the use of 
sills, groynes or breakwaters used in combination with sand, marsh plantings, or other natural materials.

The benefits of living shorelines include engineering benefits such as cost effective absorption of wave 
energy and storm surges as well as the maintenance of natural shoreline dynamics. Environmental benefits 
include improved water quality (by settling sediments and filtering pollution), greater abundance and 
diversity of aquatic species and a linkage between aquatic and upland habitats. 

Living shorelines have typically been designed and implemented using a collaborative approach; working 
with several levels of government, riparian property owners, nature trust organizations and other 
stakeholders.

One of the leading proponents of living shorelines is the State of Maryland. Maryland has over 11,000 
kilometres (7,000 miles) of tidal shoreline along Chesapeake Bay and other coastal watersheds. The 
state faced an annual loss of over 235 hectares (580 acres) of coastal shoreline and a permitting issue 
wherein soft armouring was at a major disadvantage compared to structural protection. Under the 
Living Shoreline Protection Act of 2008, the State of Maryland adopted non-structural “living shorelines” 
erosion control measures as the preferred method to address the impacts of shore erosion induced by 
sea level rise wherever technologically and ecologically appropriate. This legislation does not prevent the 
implementation of hard structural measures, but requires soft or non-structural measures be considered 
first. Adoption of the Living Shoreline Protection Act followed more than 20 years of research on the 
effectiveness of non-structural erosion control in Chesapeake Bay and other sheltered areas.109 

In Atlantic Canada, Nova Scotia and P.E.I. now employ living shorelines approaches. In B.C., communities 
on Vancouver Island and on the Sunshine Coast have used living shoreline approaches; on the west coast, 
living shores approaches are also known as “Green Shores” projects. 

Green Shores Examples from B.C.110

Green Shores is a trademarked program of the Stewardship Centre for British Columbia.  The Green 
Shores program consists of hybrid techniques that promote the sustainable use of coastal ecosystems 
through planning and design that recognizes their ecological features and functions. Their four 
principles consist of preserving the integrity of coastal processes, maintaining habitat diversity and 
function, minimizing marine pollutants to the environment, and reducing cumulative impacts to the 
coastal environment. A key program component is a Coastal Development Rating System intended for 
use by designers, builders and owners to guide Green Shores design and assess design performance.

Non-Local Government Adaptation Tools

Non-Local Government Adaptation Tools

Insurance and emergency management are also essential adaptation tools. Insurance plays almost no  
role in Canada, but is widely used in other developed countries. Emergency management is present in  
all provinces, but responsibility is shared with senior governments.
1. Insurance
Insurance is widely used to encourage sea level rise adaptation in other developed countries with extensive 
shorelines and coastal areas at risk. However, it is not currently a tool available to local governments, and its 
availability in Canada is very limited.111 

Insurance premiums are commonly based on estimates of previous losses incurred. While this approach 
can discourage asset investment within high-risk hazard areas, it also puts pressure on local, provincial 
and federal government to provide “protection” against the hazard. Flood insurance due to overland flows 
(such as storm surge or high river levels,) surface water flooding or flooding caused by groundwater is not 
available to homeowners in any province in Canada, though it is available for commercial development. A 
2004 survey of 2,100 homeowners by the Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction reported that close to 
70% believed they were insured for flood damages.112 

In Canada, provincial and federal governments provide financial support when uninsurable disaster-related 
property damage occurs. A drawback to such government relief in contrast to private insurance is that it tends 
to create distance between a household’s actual exposure to risk and the household’s perception of risk.113 
This distance between actual and perceived risk can encourage people to reside in flood-prone areas with  
the understanding that government will bear the cost of some flood-related damages.114

According to the insurance industry, certain conditions must be in place in order for insurance to be a viable 
tool; these conditions include:

1.  Mutuality – a large number of people must combine to form a risk pool or community.

2.  Need – there must be a need for insurance to cover an anticipated risk such as flooding or erosion.

3.  Ability to be assessed – the peril must be measurable and quantified in terms of possible losses of 

economic value. 

4.  Randomness – the risk  must be independent of the will of the insured and the event must not be 

predictable, except in a general way.

5.  Economic viability – the risk community must be able to cover the anticipated losses.

6.  Similarity of threat – the risk community must be exposed to the same threat and the occurrence of 
anticipated damages must result in the need for funds in the same way for each member of the risk 
community.

The success of insurance depends on how these six conditions are addressed. 

Not all of these conditions are present for flood insurance in Canada. The biggest challenge to the 
introduction of flood insurance in Canada is mutuality. The risk of flooding does not apply equally 
throughout a province or throughout most communities; it is limited to specific areas. Property owners 
most exposed to a flood risk will be motivated to purchase flood insurance. Demand for flood insurance

will be low outside of risk areas. For example, flood insurance would generate minimal demand in Regina, 
Saskatchewan compared to Ladner, B.C.

Economic viability is another challenge. Economic viability is threatened when large losses affect an area 
with a large concentration of policy holders. Flood insurance rates would be prohibitively expensive for 
those concentrated in high-risk areas. Some, but not all, of this risk can be addressed through reinsurance 
(i.e., spreading the risk among insurance companies to other areas with different risks).

Both of these challenges are related to a problem called adverse-selection. Demand for flood insurance 
is concentrated in areas with a high risk of flooding; few people would voluntarily purchase insurance 
specifically to protect against flooding if they did not live in a flood risk area. Adverse selection violates  
a basic principle of insurance, which is to spread the risk. Adverse selection results in insurance rates that 
are prohibitively high for homeowners.

There are several ways to address these challenges of flood insurance. By bundling flood insurance with 
other forms of insurance, such as fire and theft, insured risks are spread over a larger pool of properties, 
across different perils and different rating areas. Bundling broadens the risk pool and is used to lower costs 
and increase insurance penetration rates. Bundling insurance to include flood or erosion coverage can 
make it unavoidable, or effectively compulsory. 

The United Kingdom uses this approach to overcome the challenges of flood insurance. There, flood 
insurance, whether inland or coastal, is included with other insured risks and is required by mortgage 
companies. Bundled coverage is also in place in Japan, Spain, Portugal, Switzerland and Israel. 

Another approach is to subsidize the cost of flood insurance. In the U.S.A., flood insurance is partially 
subsidized by the federal government. Flood insurance is intentionally kept affordable in order to enhance 
participation rates. Insurance premiums cover administration costs and operating costs in most years, but 
not the full cost of major disasters.

Flood insurance is widely used in developed countries with extensive coastal lowlands. The following 
provides a summary of how flood insurance is used in the U.S.A., Germany and the United Kingdom.

United States of America
The National Flood Insurance Program is administered through the Federal Emergency Management Agency 
(FEMA) in cooperation with private insurance agencies. The National Flood Insurance Program was created by 
the U.S. Congress in 1968 to help provide a means for property owners to financially protect themselves. Prior 
to that, private flood coverage was excluded from standard homeowner policies and the primary recourse of 
flood victims was government disaster assistance. In its early years, even subsidized rates did not provide a 
sufficient incentive for homeowners to purchase flood insurance or for communities to join the National Flood 
Insurance Program. Subsequent legislative changes in 1974 and 1994 required federally insured or regulated 
lenders to require flood insurance as a condition of granting or continuing a loan for a building located in the 
Special Flood Hazard Area of a participating community. The federal government, through FEMA, sets flood 
insurance premium rates, identifies flood zones and risks and sets the standard for construction in floodplains. 
Local governments are responsible for adopting development regulations that meet National Flood Insurance 
Program standards. Close to 90 private insurers sell flood insurance policies and collect flood insurance 
premiums on behalf of the government but do not assume any risk.

Currently over 20,000 U.S. communities participate in the National Flood Insurance Program. This program 
offers flood insurance to homeowners, renters, and business owners. The incentive is affordable rates of 
flood insurance and coverage up to USD$250,000 for a residential building and up to USD$100,000 for 
personal property (i.e., contents). In return, participating communities agree to adopt and enforce bylaws 
(referred to as ordinances in the U.S.A.) that meet or exceed FEMA requirements designed to reduce the risk 

86

of flooding. Flood management measures include many of the tools documented in this report. Applicable 
tools include zoning, subdivision, scour protection, structural elevation, wet floodproofing, easements, land 
trust agreements and land acquisition. Mapping plays a multipurpose role. Flood Rate Insurance Maps are 
used to identify communities at risk (i.e., areas subject to a 100 year flood), set insurance premiums and 
regulate development in floodplains. In the 30 years since the inception of the National Flood Insurance 
Program, buildings constructed to federal standards have sustained 77% lower losses than buildings 
without such protection.

Flood insurance premiums vary according to several factors, including the deductible chosen by the 
homeowner, the amount of protection provided, either structural elevation (dry floodproofing) or wet flood 
proofing, the date of construction and the potential and probability of a hazard. Low elevation properties 
located near the ocean are considered high risk due to storm surge flooding and hurricane risks. The cost 
for the maximum available building (USD$250,000) and contents (USD$100,000) insurance in a coastal 
high risk zone is up to USD$6,410 annually. This compares to similar coverage of USD$1,717 per year in a 
moderate to low risk area and as low as USD$365 per year in a preferred risk (i.e., low) area.

In 2011, under the National Flood Insurance Program, 5.5 million flood insurance policies were written, 
USD$3.4 billion collected in premiums and USD$1.43 billion paid out in flood claims. Expenditures for flood 
hazard mapping and risk analysis exceeded USD$97.7 million.115 In addition to managing the National Flood 
Insurance Program, FEMA has a broad mandate to lead and support the nation in a risk-based comprehensive 
emergency management system of preparedness, protection, response, recovery and mitigation. In an 
attempt to reduce a deficit of over $25 billion in the National Flood Insurance Program, the Biggert-Waters Flood 
Insurance Reform and Modernization Act of 2012 mandated that some subsidies be phased out, resulting in a 
large rate increase for some property owners.  The resulting backlash led to a proposed four year delay in its 
implementation.

Germany
Private insurance companies in Germany have offered insurance for natural hazards as a supplement to 
building and contents insurance since 1991.116 This supplemental policy is optional for property owners 
and covers losses due to flooding. However, storm surge is an uninsurable risk and is excluded from 
supplemental policies. The market penetration for building insurance is approximately 90%, as banks 
require this as a condition for obtaining loans; market penetration for supplemental hazard insurance is 
much lower (26% in 2010).

Germany does not have a national system of flood hazard mapping. As a result, the German insurance 
industry developed an online risk assessment tool called ZURS Geo. This geo-based data system uses 
property addresses to identify the risk of flooding in any geographical area and offers a risk-based insurance 
premium. This tool uses a four zone system, with the lowest risk being less than a 1 in 200 year event and the 
highest being more than a 1 in 10 year event. 

Following a major flooding of the Elbe River in 2002, the most expensive in German history, a widespread 
evaluation of the state of flood insurance took place. Most private sector losses were not covered by private 
insurance. This led to the consideration of mandatory natural hazard insurance. The compulsory insurance 
option was rejected, largely due to a major concern that buyers would experience premium shock due to 
much higher reinsurance requirements. Other options were pursued, including 2004 legislation passed by 
the German Parliament prohibiting development on flood prone land. As a result, it has been estimated 
that 10% of the land area cannot feasibly be insured, although only 1.5% of the buildings are uninsurable. 
The German model has been criticized for lacking incentives to strengthen private loss mitigation and 
insurance companies for doing little to encourage precautionary measures.

United Kingdom
The United Kingdom has approximately 2.2 million homes at risk due to coastal or inland flooding. 
Approximately 330,000 homes have a flood risk greater than 1 in 75 years. Insurers have agreed to provide 
insurance in all areas where the flood probability is less than the highest risk threshold. Where the flood 
probability is greater than 1 in 75 years and improved flood defenses are provided, flood insurance for 
households and small businesses will be maintained. Where the flood probability is greater than  
1 in 75 years and no flood defenses are planned, flood insurance for households and small businesses  
is considered on a case by case basis.117

Flood risk has been grouped according to three classes. The low probability Zone 1 consists of lands with 
a less than 1 in 1,000 year flood risk. The medium probability Zone 2 consists of lands with a probability 
of flooding from the sea of between 1 in 200 and 1 in 1,000 years. The high probability Zone 3 contains land 
with a greater than 1 in 200 year probability of sea flooding (or greater than 1 in 100 probability of riverine 
flooding). Under the policy, development should be steered away from Zones 2 and 3 and toward  
Zone 1. This policy statement includes flood risk changes resulting from climate change, particularly those 
associated with sea level rise.118 

Building insurance is not compulsory in the United Kingdom, but such insurance is generally required to obtain 
mortgage financing. Flood insurance is bundled as part of standard home insurance and is included in the 
building and contents policy. Insurers generally do not refuse flood coverage for residential property, regardless 
of flood risk, and as a result, the vast majority of households have flood insurance coverage.119

Key features of the U.K. approach to flood management include a bundled approach to flood insurance, 
a very high penetration rate of 95% for flood insurance, the option for insurers to exclude very high risk 
homeowners in order to avoid the problem of adverse-selection, risk-based flood insurance pricing, partial 
risk assumption by private homeowners through a system of deductibles, variable premiums and on-site 
risk mitigation. Government responsibilities consist of land use planning, risk assessment through the 
development of flood hazard maps and off-site structural protection measures. The Association of British 
Insurers indicated in 2007 that annual flood defense spending needed to increase from £500 million to a 
minimum of £750 million in order to maintain design-specification levels of protection.120

The national government does not have statutory authority for the management of development in flood-
prone areas. These responsibilities have been delegated to regional and local planning authorities although 
they are permissive, not mandatory. Regional and local planning authorities have the authority to develop 
strategies to appraise and manage flood risk through policy development in areas subject to flood hazards. 

Until very recently the national government’s perspective was reflected in a series of Planning Policy 
Statements concerning town planning. Planning Policy Statement 25 concerned national policy on 
development and flood risk in England. This policy ensured that flood risk was taken into account at all 
stages in the planning process to avoid inappropriate development in areas at risk of flooding, and to 
direct development away from the areas of highest risk. These Planning Policy Statements were replaced by 
a single document called the National Planning Policy Framework finalized in March 2012. This document 
retains many of the previous risk management policies, although in an edited form.

Of particular interest is a policy calling on local planning authorities to “reduce risk from coastal change 
by avoiding inappropriate development in vulnerable areas or adding to the impacts of physical changes 
on the coast.” Local planning authorities are called on to identify as a Coastal Change Management Area 
any area likely to be affected by physical changes on the coast and make clear what development will be 
appropriate in such areas and in what circumstances, as well as to make provision for the relocation of 
development and infrastructure where this is needed. Another policy sets out recommended contingency 
allowances for net sea level rise that increase from 4.0 mm/year at present, to 8.5 mm/year after 2025, to 
12.0 mm/year after 2055 and to 15.0 mm/year after 2085 for London, East England and Southeast England.  

The Potential Role of Insurance in Adaptation
There are several reasons why insurance may receive increasing attention in the future. One is that the areas 
at risk of coastal flooding and subsequent damages are anticipated to increase exponentially over time. The 
current cost of flood damage to private property is largely met by the provincial government and, for major 
events, the federal government through Disaster Relief assistance. The expectation of guaranteed disaster 
relief also reduces the incentive to take precautions in the way of flood-proofing or hazard avoidance 
measures.121 Senior governments are aware of the rising risk and cost implications they will increasingly 
have to absorb under current provisions. 

Second, the current approach involves a considerable degree of moral hazard. This refers to the tendency 
to take undue risks because the costs are not borne by the party taking the risk. If an area is subject to 
flood hazard, the property owner will suffer inconvenience in the event of a flood but little economic risk. 
The current deductible is nominal and there is no economic incentive for a property owner to undertake 
proactive preventative action. Local governments have a wide array of tools to address new development. 
Except in the limited cases of improvement areas in rural areas, any off-site structural protection will likely 
be funded through the general tax base of a local government in association with senior governments. 

Third, the nature of flood risk due to sea level rise varies considerably from one area to another. Little of that 
risk is borne by property owners in the areas at risk. 

Flood insurance can address all of these concerns to some degree, because it will transfer some of the 
risk away from senior governments and onto private property owners through insurance premiums. 
With variable premiums, flood insurance provides an incentive for a private property owner to undertake 
proactive action to reduce on-site risk. Flood insurance also provides an incentive for an avoid strategy by 
encouraging development in areas not at risk from coastal flooding and penalizing development in areas  
at risk (without including land use policy and Official Community Planning considerations). 

From the case studies discussed above, two conditions are essential to the success of flood insurance. One 
is that the use of flood insurance must have broad application to properties at risk, whether it follows the 
U.S.A. or the U.K. model. Second, the utility and success of flood insurance is much higher if it complements 
other forms of risk reduction undertaken by property owners and local governments.

Advantages and Disadvantages of Potential Insurance Tool for Adaptation to Sea Level Rise

Advantages

Disadvantages

There is an expectation that government will provide 
protection against the consequences of natural disasters. 
The consequences of sea level rise are not intentional 
and residents of areas subject to disasters would not feel 
personal responsibility for flooding. 
Administration of flood insurance claims in other 
jurisdictions is not without controversy. 

Would better align risk management objectives. 
Homeowners who choose to purchase in areas at risk 
would pay for the additional risk and those in low risk 
areas would benefit from risk avoidance. Flood insurance 
provides an incentive for an avoid strategy.
Flood insurance premiums will spread risk with other 
geographical areas also subject to flood risk. 
Owners of residential dwellings would be able to obtain 
insurance for the actual value of improvements (current 
Disaster Financial Assistance limit in B.C. is $300,000).
Flood insurance could be linked with other forms of 
insurance commonly used in Canada (e.g. house and 
mortgage insurance)
Homeowners in high risk areas incur minimal risk at 
present. 

2. Emergency Management
Emergency and post disaster management refer to measures undertaken during and after a disaster. 
Emergency Planning and Preparedness refer to measures undertaken in advance of a disaster and is discussed 
in the section on Planning Tools. Emergency management is distinguished from the Emergency Planning 
and Preparedness for two reasons. First, some emergency management functions are provincial or federal 
responsibilities (i.e., disaster financial assistance and declaration of provincial disaster) whereas emergency 
planning and preparedness is primarily a local government responsibility. This Primer is intended to focus on 
tools available to local government. Second, emergency management takes place during and after a disaster, 
and so cannot be considered a proactive adaptation tool like the utility tools in this Primer.

Emergency activities can be structured in four components: (1) preparedness; (2) response; (3) recovery; 
and (4) mitigation122 or adaptation. The first is discussed under the Emergency Planning and Preparedness 
tool while the following two are discussed in this section. Response refers to warning and evacuation 
measures. Recovery refers to clean-up and compensation for losses. The final component may include any 
of the tools in this Primer and demonstrates that the process is iterative. 

Enabling Legislation
In an emergency situation, federal responsibility (all departments and agencies), where applicable, is governed 
by the Emergency Management Act. The Act also allows for the development of programs to deal with emergency 
events. The federal government has exclusive responsibility for emergencies related to war, armed conflict and 
counter-terrorism. The federal government also has responsibility for First Nations reserves through Aboriginal 
Affairs and Northern Development Canada. This Act recognizes the interests of the provinces, territories and local 
authorities in relation to federal assistance provided during a provincial emergency.123

The Emergency Program Act is the applicable legislation in B.C. Further information about this Act is 
provided under the Emergency Planning and Preparedness tool. The provincial emergency flood response 
is detailed in the British Columbia Flood Response Plan, adopted in April 2012.

The B.C. Dike Maintenance Act of 1996 describes the powers and duties of the Inspector of Dikes, 
orders that may be issued, consequences of failure to carry out an order, offences and appeals. Diking

Authorities own and operate the public diking systems in B.C. and they are obliged to have a flood 
response plan, which should be integrated with the Local Authority Emergency Response Plan, and 
provide emergency response.

The British Columbia Flood Response Plan describes the methodology the Province will utilize for coordinating 
activities to manage response to a flood event, depending on its magnitude. This includes the roles and 
responsibilities of other levels of government, provincial ministries and agencies and other stakeholder groups.

Other provinces also have emergency management provisions. For example, in Nova Scotia, the Emergency 
Management Act is the governing legislation dealing with emergency management and emergency powers 
legislation. The Act creates and gives powers to the Emergency Management Officer (EMO) to act on 
government’s behalf in an emergency.124

In Quebec, disaster relief funds from the Ministry of Public Security currently include support for damage 
incurred by major storm events, both for public infrastructure and for private property. For private 
properties damaged or destroyed in coastal areas from storm surges, up to $150,000 in compensation can 
be paid out to those willing to relocate, under the following conditions:
•  The property in question is the primary residence (secondary residences are not covered)
•  The lot and remaining structure is sold to the municipality for $1
•  The municipality cannot erect any new construction, but can create a recreational area on such lands
•  The home relocated to must fall outside the setback established by the provincial government for the region

For the time being this mechanism is ad hoc, activated on a case-by-case evaluation of storm events 
undertaken between the Province and the impacted municipalities.

Application
Local authorities (i.e., municipalities and regional districts) have the primary responsibility for emergency 
management within their jurisdiction. As noted in the section on the Emergency Planning and 
Preparedness tool, this includes the preparation of local emergency plans. Should flooding occur, the 
local government is responsible for activating emergency plans and their emergency operations centre, 
notifying the provincial authority of local emergency response activities, issuing evacuation notices, as 
required, establishing local centres for public inquiries and providing post-flood information. If the local 
government requires emergency powers within the Emergency Program Act, including the evacuation of 
residents, a state of local emergency should be declared.

The British Columbia Flood Response Plan details that province’s approach in co-ordinating the ministries 
involved in flood management during an integrated provincial response event. Emergency Management 
British Columbia has the primary responsibility for co-ordinating the provincial management structure. 
The Provincial Emergency Program (PEP), a division of the Ministry of Public Safety and Solicitor General, 
Emergency Management B.C., works with local governments year-round, providing training and support 
before, during and after emergencies. 

Other provincial agencies and responsibilities include the following:
•  Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure – safety of provincial highways and bridges
•  Ministry of Health – monitoring and managing public health impacts including sewage disposal and 

drinking water expertise

•  Ministry of Environment – hazardous material, flood debris management and other threats to the 

environment

124 

(Birch Hill GeoSolutions 2008)

91

•  Water Management Branch, Ministry of Forests, Lands and Natural Resource Operations – provide flood 
forecasts and bulletins, liaise with Environment Canada regarding weather forecasts, provide oversight 
to dam and dike owners, and modeling to support flood level efforts

•  Ministry of Community, Sport and Cultural Development – guidance and assistance to local government 

regarding infrastructure including emergency funding, as required

The following regulations under the Emergency Program Act further describe the program:
•  Emergency Program Management Regulation, 1994

This regulation defines the obligations of the Provincial Emergency Program, emergency plans and procedures 
of ministers and government corporations, the Inter-Agency Emergency Preparedness Council, the role of 
ministers in relation to hazards, the role of ministers and government corporations in emergency or disaster.
•  Compensation and Disaster Financial Assistance Regulation, 1995

This regulation describes compensation and disaster financial assistance, eligibility for assistance and what 
is covered. Disaster financial assistance may be claimed for eligible personal expenses (i.e., the principal 
residence of the owner of a structure damaged or destroyed in a disaster and “the necessities of life” of 
a tenant, small business expenses, farm operation expenses, charitable or volunteer expenses and local 
government body expenses). Assistance is limited to 80% of an accepted claim over a deductible of $1,000 
up to a maximum of $300,000. Financial assistance to repair or rebuild a structure may be denied  
if assistance has been provided on two previous occasions.
•  Local Authority Emergency Management Regulation, 1995

This regulation outlines the required contents of Local Emergency Plans and defines the powers and duties 
of a local authority under the Act.

As previously noted, Quebec provides for up to $150,000 in compensation for those willing to relocate. 
Where the market value of the damaged property is less than $150,000, disaster relief has served its 
intended purposes of providing compensation for private losses and acquiring high risk property to ensure 
the Province is not subject to repeat claims for compensation. A key challenge is where the value exceeds 
$150,000, since property owners lack a financial incentive to relocate or undertake additional protective 
measures; this leads to continued or increased vulnerability on the same site.

Disaster Financial Assistance Arrangements
Disaster Financial Assistance Arrangements are designed to provide financial assistance from the federal 
government on a sliding scale where disaster damages exceed $1.00 per capita of provincial population. 
For disasters below this threshold, no federal assistance is provided. The federal contribution increases 
to 50% where damages are between $1.00 and $3.00 per capita of provincial population. The federal 
contribution increases to 75% if the damages are between $3.00 and $5.00 per capita of provincial 
population and to 90% if they exceed $5.00 per capita of provincial population. Examples of federal 
government assistance include the 1997 flooding in Manitoba’s Red River Valley, the 2003 wildfires in  
B.C.’s Okanagan Valley, and the 2013 floods in Calgary and High River, Alberta. 

Each province is responsible for the development and implementation of disaster recovery assistance 
programs, for deciding when disaster payments are provided, and for determining the amount that will 
be provided in their jurisdiction. A 2008 revision allowed for a 15% supplement of total disaster recovery 
payouts to provinces in order to mitigate the impacts of future hazard events. The key objective of the 
revised program is to reduce or prevent the recurrence of damages. 

92

The Cost of Sea Level Rise and Adaptation

The Cost of Sea Level Rise and Adaptation

The cost of coastal adaptation is considered to be the sum of all investments (and maintenance costs) 
necessary to protect coastline and human settlements located in at-risk areas. The estimated annualized 
cost for optimal levels of protection can be modest, frequently less than 0.1% of national Gross Domestic 
Product (GDP). However, adaptation costs may be high relative to the GDP of coastal areas, as there is no 
guarantee protection costs will be absorbed fully at the national level.125

The National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy released a report, “Paying the Price: The 
Economic Costs of Climate Change for Canada” in September 2011. The study noted that Prince Edward 
Island has the largest proportion of its land area at risk due to flooding by 2050 as a result of climate 
change. B.C., on the other hand, has the lowest proportion of its land area at risk but the majority of 
dwellings at risk, due to the high housing density in the Lower Mainland, much of which is low lying. The 
Lower Mainland, consisting of Metro Vancouver and the lower Fraser River Valley, is very vulnerable to sea 
level rise because of a 127 kilometre system of dikes, which were not built with sea level rise factored into 
the design. This area also has very expensive real estate subject to flood risks. 

The report examined coastal lands that would be at risk without sea level rise (baseline case) and the 
additional lands at risk due to climate change. The report evaluated two adaptation strategies for coastal 
areas: climate related development planning and strategic retreat. The first strategy prohibited future 
construction in areas expected to be at risk of flooding by 2050 in a high climate change scenario. No 
additional growth would be permitted, but existing dwellings could be rebuilt following a storm surge.  
The second strategy involves a gradual abandonment of newly flooded areas. The National Round Table  
found that both strategies reduce the overall cost of climate change, but that strategic retreat produced 
benefits one order of magnitude higher than climate-wise development planning. When pursued in 
combination, the two strategies could lower the cumulative cost by $1 to $6 billion over the next century. 
Funding Projects Related to Sea Level Rise in Canada
There is currently no national program for funding shoreline protection or for combating the impacts of 
sea level rise along the 243,000 kilometres of coastline in Canada. Some funding for shoreline protection 
is provided via programs such as the Building Canada Fund, Gas Tax Fund, Disaster Financial Assistance 
Program, Small Crafts Harbour Program, Infrastructure projects, Highway funding programs, St. Lawrence 
Plan, Green Municipal Fund and other federal initiatives.

Funding is also available from Environment Canada, Environmental Damages Fund for the protection 
of and restoration of wildlife habitats in coastal areas. Natural Resources Canada has also made funding 
available to help assess the impacts of climate change and how to mitigate and adapt to them. The 
Regional Adaptation Collaborative program has contributed valuable funding to help provinces, local 
governments and individuals improve their decision-making in regard to adapting to sea level rise, storm 
surges, heavy to intense precipitation events, flooding and other events related to climate change.

Major damage from the December 2010 storm in the Bas-Saint-Laurent Region, qC

In December 2010, a major storm event in the Bas-Saint-Laurent Region, QC  eroded seven metres 
of the shoreline and destroyed nearly 100 homes in the region. In the absence of a regulatory 
framework for dealing with such natural disasters, the Minister of Public Security announced that  
the province would compensate property owners up to $150,000 toward rebuilding elsewhere on 
safer grounds.

The agreement required owners to sell their property to the municipality for $1. The municipality, 
as owner of the land, was not able to build on the land but could use it for recreational purposes. 
Eighty compensation packages were issued once evaluations were conducted by the provincial 
government. Many owners refused the packages, as $150,000 was not enough money for relocation. 
In some cases, residents unable to supplement the compensation were forced to remain in damaged 
homes in high-risk areas. Given the lack of regulation on erosion in the area, construction and 
reconstruction permits are still being issued in high risk areas. 

Recognizing that it would not be able to offer similar compensation in the future, in 2011 the 
province suggested the region adopt a 30m standard setback. Neither the region nor any of its 
municipalities adopted this standard, and requested more detailed research be completed in order 
to establish setback lines per coastal zone based on regionally specific science (J.-p. Savard 2012).

Quebec is a province with significant funds available for adapting to seal level rise. The financing available 
to municipalities for adapting to sea level rise comes via the Framework for Natural Disaster Risk Prevention 
Funds from the Ministry of Public Security. In November 2006, the province designated $55 million to 
support municipal adaptation projects to climate change, with $26.6 million specifically earmarked for 
adaptation to coastal erosion. Municipalities apply to the fund and contribute a portion of the total initial 
budget. The provincial money represents a one-time investment – the municipality is responsible for the 
cost of maintenance over time. This fund is expected to be renewed under the 2013-2020 Climate Change 
Action Plan. 

Under this program, Sept-Îles was approved for a $6 million project to rebuild the sandbank on the east 
end of the city. The municipality would have to contribute $2 million of the total budget, and would be 
responsible for all maintenance costs over time. The local government had difficulty obtaining public 
support for the levy needed to raise funds, as it would have been applied to all residents while only the 
ocean-front property owners would benefit. In the end, Sept-Îles declined the grant, as it could not find  
a realistic means of coming up with their portion of the contribution required. 

Municipalities in Atlantic Canada that own property or infrastructure along the coastline have taken action 
to protect their capital assets from sea level rise, storm surges and other climate events. This includes 
installing shoreline protection systems at facilities such as waste water treatment facilities, streets, parks, 
recreational facilities, and other municipal infrastructure. In 2011, Nova Scotia implemented a new 
requirement for Federal Gas Tax Reporting for the period 2010- 2014. Nova Scotia municipalities must now 
prepare Municipal Climate Change Action Plans (CCAP) to access the Gas Tax funds. These plans must be 
submitted by December 31, 2013. 

Municipalities in British Columbia have also taken proactive action. Responses vary considerably, but 
measures include updated Official Community Plans, updated floodplain mapping, increasing Flood 
Construction Levels, raising dike elevations and appurtenant flood protection structures, installing artificial 
reefs and public education measures. Federal-provincial cost sharing programs in B.C. have played an 
essential role in the implementation of structural protection measures.

Funding Programs in Other Countries

New Jersey Shore Protection Program
The State of New Jersey provides an excellent example of innovative funding. The New Jersey 
Department of Environmental Protection has a Shore Protection Fund which dedicates USD$25 
million annually “to protect existing development and infrastructure from storm surges, sea level rise 
and shoreline migration through dune creation and maintenance, beach nourishment projects, and 
construction and repair of shore protection structures.” The monies for this fund are generated from a 
realty transfer fee imposed on the recording of deeds transferring real property, calculated based on 
the amount paid in the deed.

Western Australia Coastal Protection Policy and Grant Program
Western Australia’s Department of Transport provides up to 50% of the cost of planning, investigation, 
design and construction of emergency coastal protection works, public coastal protection works, 
necessary data collection and the maintenance of marine structures for permanent coastal protection.
Once structures are built, the local coastal managers have ownership of the structures and are 
responsible for ongoing repair and maintenance.

England – Flood and Coastal Resilience Partnership Funding
The United Kingdom allocates £2.1 billion of partnership funding annually for flood and coastal 
erosion risk management projects in England. Funding levels are related to the number of households 
protected, the damages being prevented and any other benefits. The United Kingdom Environment 
Agency, local authorities and internal drainage boards carry out the flood and coastal risk management 
schemes using the grant funding allocated. The schemes approved are intended to reduce the risk of 
flooding from rivers, seas, groundwater and surface water, and to reduce the risks from coastal erosion.

Netherlands – Coastal Flood Risk Management
In the Netherlands all funding for strengthening flood defences or nourishment comes from the national 
government, and from 2000-2006 averaged €550 million per year. This amount includes funding from 
water boards, which fund maintenance costs via water board taxes. In the Netherlands, a storm surge 
warning system has been developed for exposed areas, as forecasting times for coastal flooding from 
storm surges tend to be shorter than for river flooding. Dunes and dikes protect parts of the Netherlands 
situated below sea level. 
The design of these flood defence structures are related to extreme storm surge levels. For instance, in 
the provinces of Noord-Holland and Zuid-Holland, the structures are designed to withstand the effects 
of a storm with a probability of occurrence once in 10,000 years, which corresponds to a storm surge 
level of 5 m+ Dutch Ordinance Level (NAP). The Dutch government has also made a policy decision to 
maintain the coastline at its 1990 position. In the National Spatial Strategy of 2004, the Netherlands 
guarantee safety against flooding and the preservation of the spatial quality of the coastal zone.

Appendix A – Glossary

ADAPTATION means an adjustment in natural or human systems to a new or changing environment that 
exploits beneficial opportunities or moderates negative effects. With respect to sea level rise, adaptation 
refers to action taken to prepare for its occurrence. 

ADAPTATION PLANNING refers to the process of how a community identifies ways in which it may be 

impacted by climate change, and how it develops a plan to address the negative consequences.

APPROVING OFFICER* is a person appointed under the B.C. Land Title Act with responsibility for the 

approval of subdivision plans. This involves a municipal engineer or planner for a municipality or the 
Nisga’a Lisims Government under the Nisga’a Treaty, or a Ministry of Transportation employee for a rural 
area within a regional district.

ARMOURING usually refers to a hard engineering approach to shoreline protection such as a dike, seawall 

or riprap. Soft armouring refers to shoreline protection measures without the use of concrete, rocks or 
other rigid barriers. 

BANK PROTECTION refers to the treatment of slopes of Dikes and stream banks, lakes and other water 
bodies by the placement of riprap or other forms of protection to prevent Erosion by surface runoff, 
stream flows and/or wave action.

BATHYMETRY is the study of the underwater depth of the ocean floor or other water body. A bathymetric 

map measures the ocean floor and is the underwater equivalent of a topographic map.

BEACH NOURISHMENT refers to the addition of sand or gravel to a shoreline to offset the forces of erosion. 

To be effective, beach nourishment is typically required on an ongoing basis.

CHART DATUM is the plane of vertical reference to which all charted depths and drying heights (i.e., 

vertical distance of the seabed exposed by the tide) are related. Chart Datum is generally a tidal datum 
and represents the least depth of water found in any place under “normal” meteorological conditions. 
It forms a plane so low that the water level will seldom fall below it and may also be referred to as the 
lowest astronomical tide and lowest low water. 

CLIMATE CHANGE refers to the process by which the average weather becomes different over time. 

Climate has changed due to natural forces over the course of history (e.g., volcanoes, ocean currents) but 
human activity (e.g., industry, transportation) is now considered the cause of rapid and severe climate 
change. These changes include sea level rise, more intense and more frequent extreme weather events 
(e.g., storms, hurricanes, storm surge) and in Atlantic Canada, warmer and wetter summers and winters. 

CLIMATE refers to the “average” weather over a long period of time. Aspects of climate include 

temperature, precipitation, wind speed and direction, sunshine, fog and frequency of extreme events. 

COASTAL EROSION is the wearing away or reduction of coastal land resulting primarily from wave action 

along the shore. Coastal erosion causes the shoreline to move further inland. 

COASTAL HAZARDS are naturally occurring events that can pose a threat to the health or life of people, 

property and/or the environment in coastal areas. Types of coastal hazards include storm surges, coastal 
flooding and erosion.

COASTAL SqUEEZE refers to the effect of shoreline retreat located between rising sea levels and hard 

structural protection such as dikes. Coastal habitats that are unable to migrate landward are squeezed 
between the rising sea and hard defences. This reduces the adaptive capability and the extent of 
intertidal and sub-tidal habitats including saltwater marshes.

DATUM refers to any numerical or geometrical quantity or set of such quantities that may serve as a 

reference or base for other quantities. A horizontal datum forms the basis for computations of horizontal 
control surveys in which the curvature of the Earth is considered. A vertical datum refers to elevations. 

98

DESIGN FLOOD LEVEL* is the calculated water surface elevation of the Design Flood.
DESIGN FLOOD* is a flood, which may occur in any given year, with a 200 year recurrence interval, based 

on a frequency analysis of unregulated historic flood records or on regional analysis where there is 
inadequate data available.

DIKE (or DYKE) is an embankment, berm, wall piling or fill constructed to prevent the flooding of land or 
to provide protection from a high tide plus a storm surge, possibly in combination with wind setup and 
wave run-up. The term levee is used in the U.S.A.

EROSION refers to the loss of land or bed materials due to the action of flowing water, which can be regular 

or highly episodic.

ESTUARY is a partly closed coastal or tidal body of water with one or more streams or rivers flowing into it 

and a free connection to the ocean.

FLOOD CONSTRUCTION LEVEL (FCL)* is the Design Flood Level plus the allowance for Freeboard used 

to establish the minimum elevation of the underside of a wooden floor system or top of a concrete slab 
for habitable buildings. In the case of a manufactured home, the ground level or the top of the concrete 
or asphalt pad, on which it is located, shall be equal to or higher than the above-described elevation. It 
also establishes the minimum crest level of a Standard Dike. Where the Design Flood Level cannot be 
determined or where there are overriding factors, an assessed height above the Natural Boundary of the 
water body or above the natural ground elevation is typically used.

FLOODBOX is a drainage culvert through a dike that conveys the internal drainage from a watercourse 
from inside the dike to the body of water (i.e., river or ocean) outside the dike. A gate is installed at the 
outlet end of the floodbox to prevent backflow from the body of water to the inside and to allow gravity 
flow from inside to the outside.

FLOODING refers to the overflowing of water onto land. Inland flooding usually results from faulty 

infrastructure or sudden and/or heavy precipitation that exceeds the design capacity of infrastructure. 
Coastal flooding usually results from high tides and storm events also called storm surges. 

FLOODPLAIN is a lowland area, whether diked, floodproofed, or unprotected, which is at an elevation 

susceptible to flooding from an adjoining watercourse, lake, ocean or other body of water based on the 
area submerged by the Designated Flood plus freeboard.

FLOODPROOFING refers to the alteration of land or buildings to reduce flood damages. Floodproofing 
may include adding fill to raise the elevation of a building site, structural measures such as foundation 
walls or columns to raise a building, or combinations of fill and structural measures. Floodproofing also 
includes wet floodproofing, in which water-resistant building materials are used to reduce damage.

FREEBOARD is the vertical distance (typically 0.6 m) added to the calculated elevation of the Design Flood 

level to accommodate uncertainties. Such uncertainties include hydraulic and hydrological variables, 
potential for wave run-up, storm surges and other natural phenomena.

GABIAN BASKET OR WALL is a form of rip-rap consisting of a cage or basket of heavy wire containing 

rocks designed to protect shorelines from erosion.

GEODETIC DATUM means a set of constants specifying the coordinate system used for geodetic control 
(i.e., for calculating the coordinates of points on the Earth). The Canadian Geodetic Vertical Datum is the 
current orthometric height reference in Canada. 

GROYNE (or GROIN) is a rigid structure built from an ocean shore or a river bank that interrupts the flow of 
water and limits the movement of sediment. An ocean groyne is typically constructed of rip rap or other 
heavy material perpendicular to the shore, extending from the upper foreshore or beach into the water.

HABITABLE AREA means any room or space within a building or structure that is or can be used for human 

occupancy, commercial sales, or the storage of goods, possessions or equipment (including furnaces) 
which would be subject to damage if flooded.

99

HIGH WATER MARK means that part of the ocean shore to which the waves normally reach when the tide 

is at its highest point. It is often marked by a debris or wrack line along the shore. The term strandline 
may also be used. 

INSPECTOR OF DIKES (IOD)* is an official of the B.C. Ministry of Environment as defined under the Dike 

Maintenance Act RSBC 1996, chapter 95.

LONGSHORE DRIFT means the movement of beach-grade sediments along a coast parallel to the 

shoreline. It is caused by waves obliquely hitting the shoreline.

MITIGATION means a human intervention to reduce the occurrence or impact of an activity or to enhance 

the ability to cope with those impacts.

NATURAL BOUNDARY means the visible high water mark of any lake, river, stream or other body of 

water where the presence and action of the water are so common and usual and so long continued in 
all ordinary years as to mark upon the soil of the bed of the lake, river, stream or other body of water 
a character distinct from that of the banks thereof, in respect to vegetation, as well as in respect to 
the nature of the soil itself. For coastal areas, the Natural Boundary shall include the natural limit of 
permanent terrestrial vegetation. In addition, the Natural Boundary includes the best estimate of the 
edge of dormant or old side channels and marsh areas.*

PRECIPITATION refers to rain, snow, and hail that fall from the atmosphere.
PUMP STATION is a flood protection structure used to discharge water across a dike to a body of water 
when floodboxes are closed by a high tide or high river elevation. A pump station is generally built in 
conjunction with floodboxes as a combined structure. 

RESILIENCE means the capacity to anticipate, prepare for, respond to, and recover from the effects of sea 

level rise with minimum damage to social well-being, the economy and the environment. 

REVETMENT is a sloping structure designed as a cover or facing to absorb the energy of incoming water 

and protect existing shoreline uses as a defence against erosion.

RIPARIAN RIGHTS refer to common law rights that occur to property ownership along the shore of the 

ocean, a river or lake. They typically include access to and from the water, limited rights to use the water 
in its natural state, and protection of the property from erosion.

RIPRAP is an engineered layer of graded broken rock or other heavy material, which serves as the primary 

protection against shear stress or Erosion from flowing water. Riprap protects shorelines and shoreline 
structures by absorbing and deflecting the energy of waves before they reach the areas to be protected.

RISK means the likelihood of a negative event occurring (e.g., flooding due to sea level rise) combined with 

the magnitude of the potential consequences. 

SALT MARSH is a coastal wetland on the edge of a shoreline or estuary where fresh water mixes with 

sea water. A salt marsh is the result of interaction between living organisms and natural forces of wind, 
currents, storms, tides and salt.

SAND DUNE is a ridge of sand created by the wind. Naturally occurring sand dunes represent a store of 
sediment just landward of normal high tides. Artificial sand dunes and dune rehabilitation represent a 
form of soft armouring engineered to mimic the functioning of natural dunes and reduce coastal erosion.

SETBACK is a horizontal distance which a building or landfill must be set back from a Natural Boundary  

or other reference line to maintain a Floodway and allow for potential land Erosion.

SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA refers to the land area covered by a base flood on National Flood 

Insurance Programs maps in the U.S.A. A base flood means a flood with a 1% chance of being equalled or 
exceeded in any given year. A base flood is also known as the 100-year flood and is the national standard 
used by the National Flood Insurance Program and all federal agencies for the purposes of requiring the 
purchase of flood insurance and regulating new development.

100

STORM SURGE refers to strong coastal waves pushed ashore by high winds during a storm. On the coast 

this represents the difference between the observed water level and the predicted astronomical tide. 

SUBSIDENCE refers to the sinking of the Earth’s surface in response to geologic or human-induced factors 

and may occur through gradual settlement or sudden collapse. 

VULNERABILITY refers to the degree to which a system is susceptible to, or unable to cope with the 

adverse effects of climate change, including variability and extremes. Climate change impacts include 
inland flooding or coastal hazards (e.g., coastal storms, coastal flooding, coastal erosion).

WEATHER is the state of the atmosphere (e.g., temperature, precipitation, wind) at a specific time and 

location.

WETLAND refers to a land area that is saturated with water, either permanently or seasonally. Wetland 

areas have characteristic aquatic plants adapted to their unique soil conditions and are considered 
a distinct ecosystem. Wetland water may be saltwater, freshwater or brackish. Wetland areas provide 
important environmental functions, principally water purification, flood control, and shoreline stability. 
Wetland areas are considered the most biological diverse of all ecosystems.

Under S. 852, a regional growth strategy can be mandated 
by the provincial Minister of Community, Sport and Cultural 
Development.

S. 875 includes statement of objectives and policies to guide 
land use planning, S. 876 covers bylaw process, S. 877 covers 
content including land use restrictions due to hazards or 
environmental sensitivity, S.878 addresses regional context 
statement.
S. 903 provides authority for local government to regulate 
land use. Regulation includes siting, location of uses on 
land, different uses, servicing standards, minimum areas and 
regulation of density. Also included is the power to prohibit 
any use in a zone.
S. 910 addresses designation of a floodplain by local 
government bylaw, role of Provincial Guidelines, and 
construction requirements in a flood plain including setbacks 
and minimum building elevations.

flooding and other hazards. The Approving Officer may require 
a report by a professional engineer or geoscientist concerning 
how the land can safely be used as a condition of subdivision 
approval with the report included in a restrictive covenant 
on the land title. The conditions under which a subdivision is 
approved are also included in the Land Title Act.
S. 219 can include limiting conditions necessary for the safe 
use of land as required by a Building Inspector, Approving

development and indemnifies government. 
S.55-56 gives authority to the Building Inspector to require a 
qualified professional to provide a report specifying the means 
by which the land can be safely used for the use intended 
prior to a building permit being issued. The covenant must 
be registered on title with the report concerning safe use

Section 2.2 of the policy outlines a uniform 
setback of 10 m if the land grade is less than 
30 degrees from the shore and 15 metres if 
the land grade is greater than 30 degrees from 
the shore. Section 3.1 of the policy mandates 
a special permit for new construction on all 
shorelines, to ensure compliance with the 
measures outlined in the policy. Permits 
are issued by the relevant authority, which 
depending on the location will vary from 
the municipality, the region or the Province. 
Section 3.3 of the policy bans all construction 
directly on the coastline, with some exceptions

Key Provisions

In 2005, after extensive 
consultations with its 
municipalities, the RCM of Sept-
Rivières adopted this interim 
regulation for high erosion 
rate areas, based on the inter-
ministerial report findings.

Article 7 on construction indicates that within 
the non-construction zone, as defined in 
Appendix 1 and 2 of the regulation, as per 
the research findings of the inter-ministerial 
research on erosion rates: 
• no new construction; 
• no extension of habitable surface to existing 
buildings; 
• no re-construction permits for buildings that 
have been destroyed or damaged in an amount 
equal or greater than half the value of the 
building, for whatever cause; 
Some exception provisions apply and are 
stipulated. 
Article 8 on permissible work stipulates that 
individuals are only allowed to protect their 
properties from erosion through rebuilding 
sandbanks. All other structural measures 
(riprap, dikes, etc.) are prohibited, unless 
allowed for by special provision.
Appendices 1 & 2 establish setback lines for 
a 25 year protection period, according to the 
inter-ministerial report recommendations. 
Appendix 1 includes the maps and Appendix 
2 includes the charts with approximately 240 
different setback lines per land sector. Setbacks 
range from 30 to 180 metres, with some zones 
declared non constructible.

Arlington Group Planning + Architecture Inc. Flood Protection Strategies in British Columbia. Report for the 

 

British Columbia Real Estate Association (BCREA), Vancouver: BCREA, 2010. Available at:  
http://www.bcrea.bc.ca/docs/government-relations/2010-11flood-protection-strategies-report-in-bc---
final.pdf?sfvrsn=2
This study reviews the legislative provisions available in British Columbia to address flood hazards. 
This included a detailed documentation of key provincial statutes, policies, information sources and 
the tools they provide for mitigating flood hazards. Potential funding sources were also identified. The 
effectiveness of current flood protection strategies is discussed in light of major changes in provincial 
legislation in 2003 and 2004 including a detailed survey of flood hazard practitioners. Although it is 
not the primary focus of the report, sea level rise is discussed in the context of highly variable coastal 
conditions, the need for updated floodplain mapping and analysis and public education. 

Arlington Group Planning + Architecture Inc. Floodproofing Options for Historic Settlements. Commissioned 

 

by Fraser Basin Council, Vancouver: Fraser Basin Council, 2001. Available at:  
http://www.fraserbasin.bc.ca/publications/documents/floodproofing.pdf
This report includes practical and cost-effective design options for floodproofing new residential 
and commercial construction within historical settlement areas. These settlement areas consisted of 
communities in the lower Fraser Valley where flood protection from the Fraser River or the sea took the 
form of dikes or other off-site structural protection. The report addresses a series of on-site mitigation 
measures that could alter the current total reliance on off-site structural protection. Design options were 
to limit flood damages, maintain or increase public safety, minimize adverse visual impacts, minimize 
adverse drainage and soil displacement impacts, minimize cleanup and repair costs, and comply with 
current statutory and regulatory requirements. Ten design scenarios were prepared; these included 
single family residences, townhouses and small commercial lots. Three lot frontages were considered 
(9.1 m, 12.2 m and 15.2 m) and two FCL increases above grade (1.7 m and 2.5 m). Geotechnical 
considerations for development in organic soils and compressible silts were also addressed. Designs for 
each scenario were prepared, illustrating conventional building areas needed for market acceptability 
while addressing on-site floodproofing requirements. Cost implications for each scenario as well as their 
advantages and disadvantages are also documented.

A Legal Review. Report No. 04-1, Ottawa, Ontario: North American Wetlands Conservation Council 
(Canada), 2004. Available at: http://www.wetlandscanada.org/conseasecov04-1.pdf
This report is an update to a 1995 publication which reviewed the state of conservation easement, 
covenant and servitude legislation at the time. Since the original publication there has been an 
increase in the use of statutorily-based easements and covenants for conservation purposes across 
Canada. More jurisdictions have introduced legislation enabling the use of such instruments 
specifically for conservation purposes and more covenants and easements have been placed on 
private land to conserve and protect open space and important ecological values on the land. During 
this same time, the federal and provincial governments have improved income tax benefits associated 
with private land protection, which has enhanced the attractiveness of the use of these tools. This 
report lists the primary statutes or portions of statutes enabling the use of conservation easements, 
covenants and servitudes in Canada.

Use.” Draft Policy Discussion Paper, 2011. Available at:  
http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/wsd/public_safety/flood/fhm-2012/draw_report.html#2
This guideline document describes the principles for determining the exposure of low lying lands 
to a flooding hazard due to their exposure to the sea and provides guidelines and direction for their 
management. It also provides guidelines intended to help local governments, land use managers and 
approving officers develop and implement land-use management plans and make subdivision approval 
decisions for lands exposed to coastal flooding hazards and sea level rise.

Barron, Sara, et al. “A Climate Change Adaptation Planning Process for Low-Lying, Communities Vulnerable 

 

to Sea Level Rise.” Sustainability, 2012: 2176-2208.
This research demonstrates a process to model, visualize and evaluate potential flood impacts and 
adaptation options. The study focus is on South Delta and Ladner and includes economic, social and 
environmental perspectives. The results of the scenario development, mapping and visualization 
imagery and assessment of indicators provided the community and decision-makers with a structured 
set of options and holistic listing of relative impacts and implications of flooding associated with sea 
level rise. The authors note a major success of this methodology is the ability for the visioning packages 
to engage in more meaningful conversations about specific adaptation strategies, their implications, 
phasing, implementation, acceptability and how they may be refined into coherent policy pathways.

http://www.nr.gov.nl.ca/mines&en/geosurvey/publications/CR2010/2010_Batterson-Liverman.pdf
This report aims to promote understanding of the direction and magnitude of future sea level change, 
which is important in creating policy and planning measures for development in the coastal zone. 
To determine guidelines for the province, local trends in sea level are examined by using tide gauge 
records, salt marsh research and other indicators of past sea level changes. These local trends are 
combined with estimates of future global sea level change to provide predictions of likely changes in 
sea level for the province. Estimates of sea level change leading up to 2050 and 2100 are provided for 
four zones covering the province. 

Birch Hill GeoSolutions. Climate Change Adaptations for Land Use Planners. Project A1209, Natural Resources 

 

Canada, 2008. Available at: http://www.cakex.org/sites/default/files/Birch_Hill_Geosolutions.pdf
The purpose of this project was to develop a toolkit for use by community Land Use Planners, with 
assistance from municipal and consulting engineers, for assessing climate change impacts on their 
community and adapting to them. An underlying theme was that more science and engineering input 
is already needed in sustainable community Land Use Planning, and climate change may increase that 
need, since it could exacerbate existing environmental impacts on development, and vice versa. The 
focus was climate change impacts in rural areas of Atlantic Canada, with test sites in Annapolis Royal 
and the Pereau River watershed in southwestern Nova Scotia. This study reviewed implementation tools 
for their applicability to climate change, including: 1) Engineering Codes of Practice; 2) Regulations 
and Administrative Practices Related to Land Use Planning; 3) Building Codes; 4) Sustainable Building 
Adaptations; and 5) Emergency Management.

This handbook helps small Canadian communities to prepare a Climate Change Adaptation Plan. The 
handbook helps community planners take the key steps required to plan for climate change adaptation, 
and decision-makers to determine what strategic actions need to be taken. It is especially useful for 
small communities without “in house” planning resources.

The toolkit focuses on a community development process for small settlements in Nunavut. The toolkit 
reflects the themes identified in the 2008 Nunavut Climate Change Partnership document entitled 
“Atuliqtuq: Action and Adaptation in Nunavut,” which are:
•  To build capacity for climate change adaptation planning within the Government of Nunavut and 

communities

•  To develop tools to collect, publish, share and communicate climate change adaptation knowledge 

across the communities of Nunavut and beyond and

•  To create scientific information that is regionally and locally targeted to help communities adapt to 

climate change and transfer this capability into Nunavut

Bowron, Beate, and Gary Davidson. Climate Change Planning: Case Studies from Canadian Communities. 

 

Prepared for the Canadian Institute of Planners, Ottawa, ON: Canadian Institute of Planners, 2012. 
Available at:  
http://www.planningforclimatechange.ca/wwwroot/Docs/Library/CIPReports/CASE%20STUDIES%20
FROM%20CANADIAN%20COMMMUNITIES%20FINAL.PDF
Ten case studies are included in this document as part of the Canadian Institute of Planners’ initiative 
to develop and disseminate best practices recommendations for climate change mitigation and 
adaptation planning. Three of the studies concern sea level rise adaptation measures. 
•  Tantramar Dykelands Infrastructure at Risk Study concerns the marshland between New Brunswick 
and Nova Scotia. The natural floodplain has been modified over several centuries to transform the 
salt marsh into arable land interspersed with freshwater creeks and wetlands. Although the system 
has worked relatively well to date, the future projection is that 90% of the dikes will be overtopped, 
flooding 20% of the Town of Sackville once a decade.
Interim Flood Construction Levels (FCLs) were established in Vancouver B.C. following the May 
2011 release of new provincial climate change adaptation guidelines for sea dikes and coastal flood 
hazard land use. Implementation is taking place in stages starting with public education followed by 
advisory standards with developers given the flexibility to select adaptation options provided the risk 
of flooding is mitigated to meet the new Provincial Guidelines. 

• 

•  Flood management planning was undertaken in Delta, B.C. using a visioning process undertaken by 
the Collaborative for Advanced Landscape Planning (CALP) at the University of B.C. in co-operation 
with the Corporation of Delta. With a population of 100,000, the community has a large farmland 
base and significant urban area (Ladner) protected from flooding by sea and river dikes. The process 
involved the establishment of a Citizen’s Working Group, the definition of climate change scenarios 
and early exploration of adaptation options. Scenarios included Reinforce and Reclaim, Hold the Line, 
and Retreat.

This report classifies the coastline of the island of Newfoundland, focusing on the sensitivity of the 
coastline to erosion and petroleum contamination. It forms the first phase of a detailed study of the 
Newfoundland coastline. A subsequent report will discuss individual locations along the coast, based 
on field, office, and laboratory research conducted throughout the period from May 2010 through 2011, 
building upon research conducted since July 1989.

http://atlanticadaptation.ca/sites/discoveryspace.upei.ca.acasa/files/ACASA%20PEI%20Shoreline%20
Classification.pdf
This report summarizes work undertaken by Coldwater Consulting Ltd. to develop shoreline classification 
and sensitivity mapping for the entire P.E.I. shoreline. The development of a shoreline classification system 
is a key step in being able to assess the effects of coastal hazards on the Island’s shorelines. Coastal hazards 
include: coastal flooding, coastal erosion, and damage to coastal ecosystems. All of these hazards are 
influenced by the combined actions of sea level rise, tides, storm surge and wave action.

Daigle, Réal. Sea-Level Rise and Flooding Estimates for New Brunswick Coastal Sections. Fredericton: Climate 

 

Change Secretariat, New Brunswick Department of Environment, 2012.
This report provides estimates of relative sea level rise over the coming century, including the storm surge 
component for return periods of 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 years, for the coastline of New Brunswick, based 
on the availability of tidal data information. The estimates of global sea level rise were used, in conjunction 
with the best estimates of local vertical motion (crustal subsidence) to calculate total sea level rise 
estimates over the next century for the coastlines of New Brunswick of 0.9 to 1.05 metres.

Scenarios%20NB%20Munic-2009.pdf
This report provides climate scenarios for 11 New Brunswick municipalities. The future periods used in 
this report are the 2020s (2011-2040), 2050s (2041-2070), and the 2080s (2071-2100). In the context of 
sea level parameters, the mid-point of the three future periods (2025, 2055 and 2085) was adopted as 
the representative year for each scenario period. 

 

Danard, M., A. Munro, and T. Murty. “Storm Surge Hazard in Canada.” Natural Hazards, 2003: 407-431.
 

This report identifies hazards from storm surge across Canada. Storm surges occur frequently in Canada 
mainly due to extra-tropical cyclones, also referred to as winter storms. Storm surges have occurred both on 
the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, St. Lawrence Estuary, Bay of Fundy, Hudson Bay, 
James Bay, Northwest Passage, Beaufort Sea, the Great Lakes and other large lakes such as Lake Winnipeg. 
The report notes that a high priority for proper assessment of storm surge hazard is the production of maps 
showing inundation zones for storm surges that might occur in populated coastal areas.

Delcan. Cost of Adaptation - Sea Dikes & Alternative Strategies. Final Report, Victoria: Province of British 

 

 

Columbia - Forests Lands and Natural Resource Operations, 2012.
The purpose of this study, commissioned By the Ministry of Forests Lands and Natural Resources, was 
to develop a ‘Class D’ estimate of the cost to adapt flood protection measures in the Lower Mainland 
to meet the rise in sea level predicted by 2100. The study area covered the Metro Vancouver coastal 
shoreline and the Fraser River shoreline as far east as the Port Mann Bridge, totaling over 250 km. 
The estimated cost of adaptation to sea level rise by 2100 from the study totalled $9,470 million. Of 
this $880 million was for structural flood protection; $350 million was estimated for utility impacts, 
pump stations and flood boxes; and $1,580 million was for property acquisition. The estimate also 
included costs for seismic upgrading which were estimated at $3,250 million. In addition to this, the 
estimate included monies for environmental requirements ($90 million) and site investigation, project 
management and engineering costs of $190 million. Finally, the estimate included a 50% contingency  
of $3,160 million to address the high-level uncertainty.

File 6346, Ottawa, Ontario: Geological Survey of Canada, 2009. Available at:  
http://www.halifax.ca/regionalplanning/documents/HRM-OF_v5.pdf
This study provides the scientific basis for a set of plausible scenarios for a 100-year planning horizon  
for coastal areas in Halifax, Nova Scotia.
The HRM Regional Municipal Planning Strategy (RMPS), adopted by Council in August 2006, included 
policies to address climate change. The RMPS recognized the effects of climate change, including 
sea level rise and storm surges, on Halifax Harbour and other coastal areas in HRM and endorsed the 
precautionary principle as an important policy consideration.

Lawrence.” Marine Geology, 2004: 169-204.
This article summarizes storm related shoreline retreat in southeastern Canada. Storms play a major role 
in shoreline recession on transgressive coasts (i.e., sea level rise relative to the land, with the shoreline 
moving toward higher ground). In the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence (GSL), southeastern Canada, long-
term relative sea level rise off the North Shore of Prince Edward Island has averaged 0.3 metres/century 
over the past 6,000 years (>0.2 metres/century over 2,000 years). This has driven long-term coastal 
retreat at mean rates >0.5 mm/annum but the variance and details of coastal profile response remain 
poorly understood. As one example, Charlottetown tide-gauge records show mean relative sea level rise 
of 3.2 mm/annum (0.32 m/century) since 1911. A further rise of 0.7 metres ±0.4 metres is projected over 
the next 100 years.

The goal of this project was to identify and create an inventory of sea level rise adaptation resource 
needs from a sample of Nova Scotia’s coastal communities. The intent of this study was to gain a general 
perspective from a varied sample of coastal communities on what is needed to move forward with sea 
level rise adaptation. This information was gathered through a series of qualitative interviews.

This report aimed to integrate relevant existing scientific climate change data and adaptation processes 
with community knowledge of climate change, to develop new tools that incorporate climate change 
concerns in community planning initiatives. The major issues identified during this study were coastal 
erosion, increased potential for more flooding from storm surge and more intense rainfall events,The 
report outlines some suggestions for Official Plan Policy such as monitoring the progress of climate 
change impacts; providing setbacks from coastal and low lying areas;allowing for construction and 
maintenance of sea walls to protect infrastructure; and not approving subdivisions which could be 
negatively affected by climate change impacts.;

This toolkit and atlas outline the impacts of climate change on Vancouver, British Columbia. It notes that 
a sea level rise of 1 m would affect 3% of the City’s land area but if an additional 2 metres is added above 
the high tide line to buffer any effects such as wave spray, overtopping, or abnormally high tides, the 
impacted area would increase to 8% of Vancouver’s 144 km2 landmass. Maps showing the location of 
areas affected by 1 m, 2 m, 3 m, 4 m 5 m and 6 m rise in sea level are shown. A spreadsheet and graph of 
the relative impact of these changes in sea level rise on different land use are also shown, as well as cross 
sections of Granville Island now and with sea level change. A brief discussion of the mitigation costs is 
included; these are $5,000/lineal metre for an earth dike and $10,000/lineal metre for a seawall; however, 
these estimates exclude the costs for waterfront property acquisitions and the new provincial seismic 
construction standards for dyke infrastructure published in 2012.

The purpose of coastal floodplain maps is to identify the coastal flood hazard(s) and to provide the 
technical basis for land use planning and developing floodplain bylaws. Floodplain mapping is an 
important first step in developing a flood hazard management plan, as floodplain maps identify the 
flood hazard(s) and provide information on the spatial distribution of Flood Construction Levels (FCLs).
This report contains guidance on estimating of some of the Flood Construction Level components, as 
well as a scope of work for more detailed site-specific engineering studies that also must be undertaken 
in order to derive the FCL. In addition, the report summarizes recommended standards for topographic 
mapping that also will be required in the production of coastal floodplain maps. A sample coastal 
floodplain map and Design Brief as an illustration of the coastal floodplain mapping process prepared 
for the City of Campbell River is provided in the report. In conjunction with this project, a series of maps 
showing potential coastal flood hazard areas for the year 2100 was developed for coastal B.C. based on 
approximate FCL’s. 
This report is intended to provide a technically sound basis for local governments to develop coastal 
floodplain maps, including an estimation of Flood Construction Levels based upon best mapping 
and engineering practices. In light of rising sea levels, coastal floodplain maps will also allow local 
governments to define sea level rise planning areas which will facilitate land use planning and 
development decisions.

Steps. St John, N.B.: New Brunswick Trust Fund, 2007. Available at:  
http://www.mta.ca/research/rstp/NB_Dyke_Assessment_Framework_ETF_Final_Report_c.pdf

  Many salt marshes in New Brunswick have been diked and drained, but as sea level continues to rise, it 

will become more and more costly to maintain dikes. This report identifies 3 options: reinforce, realign or 
remove the dikes and allow the salt marshes to return. Salt marshes act as buffer areas which naturally 
absorb the impact of wave action and flooding. The removal of certain dikes, allowing the return of salt 
marshes, is one adaptive response to sea level rise; however, it is not an easy or obvious choice. In some 
regions of New Brunswick, such as the Tantramar Marshes, reinforcement or realignment of dikes will 
likely be preferred due to the vital infrastructure they protect.
In order to discuss the future of a given dike, a systematic method is needed to evaluate the dike and 
the land uses it may protect. The goal of this project was to develop a tool that communities can use to 
assess a local dike for possible salt marsh restoration. Criteria for the assessment of dike infrastructure, 
ways to measure each criterion, and the degree of difficulty or cost are identified.

This report focuses on the ecologic, economic, social and policy conditions under which a community 
might employ dyke removal and salt marsh restoration in the Bay of Fundy region as an adaptive 
response to future climate change and sea level rise. It is a multidimensional study involving six separate 
but linked research activities including the monitoring of a restored marsh at Musquash, N.B. as well 
as looking at some of the main planned salt marsh restoration projects in the Maritime provinces. The 
importance of community consultation is discussed and a brief discussion on the policy environment for 
salt marsh restoration in N.B. and N.S. is presented.

This paper provides a national assessment of the vulnerability of Canadians to coastal processes, hazards 
and changing climate requires. The paper concludes that relative to the rest of the world, the percentage 
of Canadians living in the coastal zone is higher and growth is occurring at a higher rate, though mean 
population density is much lower. Compared to the global coastal population, the Canadian coastal 
population is very small, and the contribution of Canada’s coastal population growth to that of the 
global coastal population is barely significant.

This report provides the results of the first national study to estimate the economic consequences of 
climate change to Canada under four separate scenarios involving two factors: global GHG emissions 
and Canadian economic and population growth. The focus is on the economic impacts and cost-
effectiveness of adaptation strategies for three representative areas: timber supply, coastal areas and 
human health. The report finds that flooding damages to coastal dwellings, resulting from climate 
change induced sea level rise and storm surges could cost between $1 billion to $8 billion per year  
with higher-than-average cost impacts in Atlantic Canada.

This national assessment, produced by the Canadian government, finds that adaptive capacity in 
Canada is generally high but is unevenly distributed between and within regions and populations. Some 
adaptation is occurring in Canada, both in response to and in anticipation of, climate change impacts. 
The assessment concludes that integrating climate change into existing planning processes, often using 
risk management methods, is an effective approach to adaptation. The assessment also recognizes that 
barriers to adaptation action need to be addressed, including limitations in awareness and availability of 
information and decision-support tools.

The purpose of this resource is to provide information to Partners for Climate Protection (PCP) members 
and other municipal officials about municipal adaptation initiatives and to provide resources for 
municipal officials who wish to undertake adaptation planning. Emphasis is placed on different climate 
change impacts within regions and the importance for municipalities to take some time to investigate 
the specific risks for their communities. The document discusses the difference between mitigation and 
adaptation. The types of assessment and the preventative actions required for adaptation are for the 
most part significantly different than for mitigation. The development of an adaptation strategy begins 
with an assessment of climate change vulnerabilities – to heat, precipitation, extreme weather, wind 
speed, sea level rise, melting permafrost, changes in climate zones that affect plant, animal and insect 
species, and other factors.

Provincial Oceans Network (PON). Nova Scotia’s Draft Coastal Strategy. Draft, Halifax: Nova Scotia 

 

Government, 2011. Available at: http://www.gov.ns.ca/coast/
This draft strategy focuses on seven issues crucial to effective coastal management in Nova Scotia:
•  Coastal development 
•  Working waterfronts 
•  Public coastal access 
•  Sea level rise & storm events 
•  Coastal ecosystems and habitats 
•  Coastal water quality 
•  Governance

129

 

For each of these issues, the strategy establishes goals, objectives and actions. In many cases the same 
actions and objectives support several goals, and involve several government entities. The focus of the 
strategy is integrated management of Nova Scotia’s coasts. The goal identified with respect to sea level 
rise and storm events is: “people and property are safe from coastal hazards.” A number of objectives and 
actions are identified with respect to this goal in the draft strategy.

The goals of this project were to assess the physical and socio-economic impacts of climate change and 
accelerated sea level rise on the coast of P.E.I. particularly in relation to:
•  anticipated increase in the frequency and extent of storm surge flooding in Charlottetown;
•  anticipated decrease in sea ice, increase in wave energy, and probable increase in rates of shore 

erosion, as well as increased risk of flooding of the North Shore of P.E.I.

The project also considers feasible and effective adaptation measures that might be adopted on P.E.I. to 
minimize the impacts of these changes.

Homeowners. A Discussion Paper, Toronto: Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction & Swiss Reinsurance 
Company Ltd, 2010. Available at: http://www.iclr.org/images/Making_Flood_Insurable_for_Canada.pdf
The study provides documentation on flood management in Canada with a focus on British Columbia, 
Ontario, Quebec and Alberta. Floods are the most frequently occurring natural hazard in Canada, 
nearly five times as frequent as wildfires, the next most common disaster. Current flood damage 
remittance measures for homeowners in Canada through government relief and the limited scope 
of insurance are compared to various international approaches. An overview of flood insurance in 
the U.S.A, France, Germany and the United Kingdom is provided. Key distinctions between private vs. 
public and optional vs. bundled insurance (e.g., flood insurance linked with other forms of insurance 
or with a mortgage) are made. 
The report concludes that flood insurance could and should play a significant role in providing post-
flood financial assistance to homeowners in Canada. The United Kingdom system is preferred as the 
most adaptable to Canada. This model features a high penetration rate based on bundled, private 
insurance through an active partnership between private insurers and government.

This paper explores the feasibility of using coastal salt marsh restoration as a tool to adapt to sea level 
rise and mitigate climate change – using the Bay of Fundy as a case study. In particular it explores the 
ability of marshes to self-adapt to changes in sea level, their function as a buffer of coastal processes, 
their cost-effectiveness relative to traditional, static, man-made defences, and their ability to accumulate 
carbon. The paper investigates the possibility of using these attributes of salt marshes to increase the 
protective capacity of a coastline by increasing the amount of salt marsh through restoration projects.

adaptation/Economics_of_climate_policy/sei-canada-coastal-zones-june-2010.pdf
This report identifies sea level rise and larger, more frequent, storm surges as the two great threats to 
Canada’s coastal zones. The potential impacts of these two threats are destruction of property, coastal 
erosion, the salinization of aquifers and permanent flooding of low-lying areas. While studies to date 
have shown that one third of the Canadian coastline has a moderate or high level of sensitivity to sea 
level rise, little research exists quantifying the likely economic impacts. This study begins to fill that gap, 
combining a physical model of sea level rise and storm surge flooding with socio-economic analysis and 
a review of existing research policies related to climate impacts and adaptation. 

Estimates in the study exclude: 
•  damage to public infrastructure (such as roads, railways, ports, and public buildings); 
•  damage to non-residential private property and infrastructure (stores, factories, hotels, marinas);
•  business losses due to sea level rise and storm surges (reduced tourism revenue, the cost of an 

extended shutdown); 
relocation costs for people whose homes are destroyed (beyond the cost of replacing the dwelling);

• 
•  damage due to the salinization of fresh water; damages from erosion; and ecosystem effects. 
The report offers several policy recommendations regarding the improved accuracy of sea level rise 
studies, and the implementation of adaptation measures similar to those quantified in the report.

  Coastal planning includes the development of strategies and policies specific to the character of the 

 

coast, its resources and uses, ultimately providing a framework for decision-making. This thesis explores 
the role of planning in coastal and marine environments. 
The study notes that the need for management of human activity in marine and coastal environments is 
the result of increasing development pressure around the use of and access to natural resources along 
the coastline. It explores current issues affecting Nova Scotia’s coastline including:
•  Threats to coastal development posed by the impacts of climate change;
•  An increase in uses of coastal areas;
•  The decline of marine ecosystems caused by infilling salt marshes, dunes, and beach areas;
•  Pollution generated from land-based human activity in the watershed.

For each area, estimates are made of the value of properties at risk, the average rate of erosion, and 
future erosion rates and variability. The economic risk is presented as annual costs and compounded 
costs from 2008 to 2050.

This report uses atmospheric data for regional modelling of sea ice concentration and thickness in 
the Gulf of St. Lawrence, honing in on the areas from Trois Rivières to the Belle Isle and Cabot Straits. 
The study considers the variation in the number of days that ice can protect banks from swells via 
attenuation and reducing wind. Data demonstrates that the sea ice cover is diminishing, which has an 
impact on erosion.

estimated that 49% of single family homes in Special Flood Hazard Areas (i.e., subject to a flood risk of 1 
in 100 years or greater) have flood insurance policies. This includes an estimated 3.6 million single family 
homes. Although one third of flood insurance policies are written outside Special Flood Hazard Areas, 
the market penetration rate is extremely low - approximately 1%.

knowledge to help adapt to sea level rise in a prudent and balanced manner. The Tool Kit offers a menu 
of currently available legal devices that can reduce the harmful impacts of future sea level rise. A strong 
theme of the Tool Kit is that local governments have significant legal authority and tools now to plan for 
future changes. The 18 tools identified in this document are grouped under planning tools, regulatory 
tools and spending tools. Each tool is described, and how it can be used to facilitate adaptation outlined, 
examples of how the tools have been used are also included. Finally, the Tool Kit also provides a top-
level analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of each tool.

This report sets out projected impacts of climate change in San Diego Bay and calls for development of 
an official adaptation strategy. The report was prepared through a collaborative regional stakeholder 
process that included most public agencies and private sector representatives with a major interest in 
the future of San Diego Bay. The report identifies key vulnerabilities and recommends action including: 
public education, stakeholder engagement, incorporation of future risks from sea level rise in FEMA 
maps associated with Flood Insurance Studies, incorporation of sea level rise change into local and 
regional plans, and clear and consistent regulatory guidance from regulatory agencies.

The purpose of Tools for Coastal Climate Adaptation Planning is to provide the information necessary for 
coastal natural resource managers and community planners to select appropriate tools for their projects. 
This guide focuses on spatially explicit solutions for climate-related planning. It provides detailed 
information on a set of key tools that either alone or used in conjunction with other tools can facilitate 
multi-sector climate adaptation planning (i.e. climate adaptation planning that incorporates elements 
of ecosystem health and social wellbeing) and describes the utility and role of tools in relevant planning 
processes. The guide focuses on software and web-based tools that help incorporate data (geophysical, 
environmental or socioeconomic) and specialized analyses into the planning process. This guide is 
targeted at practitioners and decision makers involved in coastal zone management, natural resource 
management, protected area and habitat management, watershed management, conservation, and 
local planning in the coastal United States including the Great Lakes. The information and tools in this 
guide are also highly applicable to many inland and international regions.

Stanton, Elizabeth A, and Frank Ackerman. Florida and Climate Change - The Costs of Inaction. Tufts 

 

University, 2007. Available at: http://www.ase.tufts.edu/gdae/Pubs/rp/Florida_hr.pdf
This report examines the potential costs to Florida if greenhouse gas emissions continue unchecked. 
To do this, it compares an optimistic scenario (“rapid stabilization”) and a pessimistic one (“business-as-
usual”). 

  Within the two scenarios identified, the report estimates monetary values for four major categories:

• 

loss of tourism revenue, if the more unpleasant climate of the business-as-usual case makes Florida 
no more attractive year-round than it is today in its slowest season (autumn);

135

• 

increased hurricane damages, due to the greater frequency of Category 4 and 5 storms predicted by 
many climate scientists;
the value of residential real estate that is at risk from sea level rise; and
• 
• 
increased costs of electricity generation as temperatures and air-conditioning requirements rise.
The report concludes that for just these four categories the annual costs of inaction are projected to 
total $92 billion by 2050 and $345 billion by 2100 - figures that respectively would constitute 2.8% and 
5.0% of the state’s projected Gross State Product. The report goes on to state that if estimates were 
included for other sectors such as agriculture, fisheries, insurance, transportation, and water systems – 
to say nothing of ecosystem damage – the totals would be even larger.

https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/pub?list=BRO&pid=csiro:EP101185
This article explores the option of planned retreat to allow natural defences to reclaim lands as 
one adaptation option to address sea level rise. The authors use an analytical framework to explore 
obstacles and opportunities for planned retreat. This framework is applied to South East Queensland, 
Australia, where the authors note the option of planned retreat is disappearing The authors offer the 
following guiding principles to implement the changes in coastal governance required for successful 
planned retreat: (a) allocate authority and resources between levels of governance according to their 
effectiveness at each level; (b) strengthen development rules and incentives to relocate as an unwanted 
threshold is approached; (c) allow for uncertainties by enabling rules and incentives to be changed 
when circumstances change; (d) reassign public and private benefits, costs, risks, uncertainties and 
responsibilities from governments to beneficiaries of development; (e) institutionalise catastrophes as 
opportunities for change, not signals to rebuild.

This report synthesizes the most policy-relevant climate science published since the close-off of material 
for the last IPCC report. The report effectively serves as an interim evaluation of the evolving science 
midway through an IPCC cycle – IPCC AR5 is due for completion in 2013.
Each section begins with a set of key points that summarises the main findings. 

 
  With respect to sea level rise in particular, the report states current sea level rise has been 

underestimated: Satellites show recent global average sea level rise (3.4 mm/yr over the past 15 years) 
to be ~80% above past IPCC predictions. This acceleration in sea level rise is consistent with significant 
contribution from melting of glaciers, ice caps, and the Greenland and West-Antarctic ice-sheets. The 
report also states revised sea level predictions indicate that: By 2100, global sea level is likely to rise at 
least twice as much as projected by Working Group 1 of the IPCC AR4. For unmitigated emissions it may 
well exceed 1 meter. The upper limit has been estimated as ~ 2 meters sea level rise by 2100. Sea level 
will continue to rise for centuries after global temperatures have been stabilized, and several meters of 
sea level rise must be expected over the next few centuries.

International Federation of Surveyors (FIG), 2010. Avaiable at:  
http://www.fig.net/pub/figpub/pub55/figpub55.pdf
This report was commissioned in 2007 by the International Federation of Surveyors to investigate 
emerging coastal habitat issues connected to rising sea levels as a result of climate change and its 
influence on planning in coastal regions. Two objectives were established: to identify the impacts of 
rising sea levels on coastal habitats and to develop planning policy and implementation guidelines to 
assist in achieving sustainable coastal adaptation. 

Case studies from twelve separate countries were covered under six headings:

Impacts of climate change

• 
•  Coastal vulnerability
•  Measuring sea level rise and monitoring its impacts
•  Valuation of coastal resources and coastal adaptation
•  Policy development process for coastal adaptation
•  Challenges of moving coastlines
The study concludes that the impacts of climate change are already affecting many coastal regionals 
around the world. These impacts are likely to intensify over the next century. The need therefore is to plan 
for adaptation now to reduce some of the future negative effects of climate change in the coastal zone.

Sub-Committee, 2011. Available at: www.cakex.org.

  While many jurisdictions are still in earlier stages of developing climate change action plans, in the U.K. 
such plans have been implemented, legislation has been enacted, and work is now proceeding into the 
stage of monitoring and evaluating implementation. This report is the second in a series that defines 
measures for evaluating progress on reducing vulnerability to climate change, and provides a review 
of progress to date. Despite some evidence of progress, the report concludes that land use planning 
decisions in areas with flood risk (coastal, river and surface water) may be increasing overall vulnerability, 
and chosen methods of flood defence (mainly structural) may bind communities and landowners to 
rising costs in the future.

This strategy was developed by the Delta Committee at the request of the Dutch Cabinet to identify 
innovative measures to protect the Dutch coast and the low-lying hinterland against the consequences 
of climate change and to include the interaction with increased river discharge in its recommendations. 
The Dutch coastline consists of 350 km, with 3,600 km of primary flood defenses, predominately dikes. A 
majority of the country’s population lives in low-lying adjacent areas that are below sea level. 
The strategy is based on two pillars: flood protection and sustainability. The Delta Committee stated 
that a regional sea level rise of 0.65 to 1.3 m by 2100, and 2 to 3 m by 2200 should be taken into account, 
including the effect of land subsidence. 
The study contained 12 recommendations as a matter of urgency based on a conclusion that the level  
of flood protection must be raised by at least a factor of 10. 

  Recommendations focused on building with nature by expanding the coast seaward with increased 
beach nourishment (85 million m3 of sand/year from the continental shelf) and strengthened storm 
surge barriers, including island polders. Safety standards were set as: 1/250 a year for fresh water rivers, 
1/2,000 a year for lower tidal reaches, 1/4,000 a year for an extreme water events (e.g., storm surge) 
for coastal regions other than Central Holland and 1/10,000 a year for Central Holland. Limiting the 
consequences of flooding included regulation such as zoning, compartmentalisation, early warning, 
crisis management and contingency planning.

  A final recommendation consisted of setting up a Delta Fund for flood protection at arm’s length from 
the national budget financed by a combination of loans and part of the country’s natural gas revenues. 
The cost of implementing the Delta Programme was estimated to be €1.2 to €1.6 billion per annum until 
2050, and €0.9 to €1.5 billion per annum thereafter to 2100. Costs included strategic land acquisition 
and compensation for damages and loss of benefits. Including maintenance and management.

U.K. Government, 2012. Available at: www.communities.gov.uk

This document reflects the current planning policies of the National Government for England and how they 

are expected to be applied. Local planning authorities are called on to “adopt proactive strategies to 
mitigate and adapt to climate change, taking full account of flood risk, coastal change and water supply 
and demand considerations.” Planning for new development is advised to avoid increased vulnerability 
due to the impact of climate change, including suitable adaptation measures and planning of green 
infrastructure. Significant attention is given to risk assessment management in order to avoid the 
transfer or risk and development in high risk areas. Development in vulnerable coastal areas, referred to 
as Coastal Change Management Areas, is given particular attention.

The U.K. government’s Planning Policy Statement 25 sets out the national policy for Development and 
Flood Risk as it relates to land use planning. PPS 25 explicitly addresses climate change impacts and 
provides direction on including climate change information (including sea level rise projections and 
associated vulnerability and risk assessments) in land use planning by regional, local and urban planning 
authorities in the U.K. A risk-based approach is called for at all levels of government 
Planning Policy Statement 25 has been replaced by the National Planning Policy Framework (see 
reference above). However, the risk management strategy has not been changed and considerable 
detail is provided in PP 25 which is not available in the current and broader based policy framework.

This report was developed as part of the Australian Government’s support for adaptation to climate 
change and aims to help to address the need to prepare Australian governments, vulnerable industries, 
communities and ecosystems to manage the unavoidable consequences of climate change. This 
report forms part of a suite of tools being developed to assist local governments in identifying and 
implementing climate change adaptation actions. In particular, this report complements Climate 
Change Impacts & Risk Management – A Guide for Business and Government, released in 2006.
The adaptation actions that have been identified during this study are those that provide a net 
economic, social or environmental benefit no matter what level of climate change occurs.

This report was published by the insurance industry, and assesses the impacts of sea level rise on flood 
risk for the United Kingdom. Integrating data from various sources, this review considers what the 
impacts of a catastrophic storm (such as that experienced on the east coast of England in 1953) would 
be in today’s context and then with an additional 0.4 m of sea level rise factored in. The analysis is 
illustrated through the use of five case studies. According to their modeling, a single major storm event 
could give rise to costs of between £7.5 billion and £16 billion with a sea level rise of 0.4 m, and without 
any further development in affected areas. Investment in improved flood defences could reduce this 
financial cost by between £3.7 billion and £6.8 billion.

This report looks beyond the direct economic implications of sea level rise on the built environment 
to consider the broader economic impacts of sea level rise on the economic system as a whole. The 
paper proposes a framework within which to discuss the economic growth impact of sea level rise and 
summarises current debates on the measures of economic growth. It also reviews the mechanisms 
through which sea level rise can affect economic growth, namely the loss of land (including natural 
capital), the loss of infrastructure and physical capital, the additional cost from extreme events and 
coastal floods (loss of social capital) and the increased expenditure for coastal protection.

This publication was produced as a “think piece” to provoke consideration of the implications of rising 
sea levels on urban areas of the U.K. It graphically documents the results of a design charrette structured 
around three future scenarios for the cities of Kingston-Upon-Hull and Portsmouth. The report asks 
what a strategy of retreat, defense, or attack would look like from an infrastructure and architectural 
perspective for the two coastal cities. The publication serves to visualize the potential implications 
of these three different strategies over the next 100 years as well as outlining key messages and 
considerations for government, planners, architects, engineers, urban designers and the public.

This paper summarizes the importance of determining local sea level change and local land motion 
to better understand at a local level the potential. Coastal zones have changed profoundly during the 
21st century, with increasing populations, economies and urbanization. Today, low elevation coastal 
zones below 10 m elevation contain about 10% of the world’s population. With coastal development 
continuing at a rapid pace, society is becoming increasingly vulnerable to sea level rise. Rising sea levels 
have been and will continue to be felt most acutely through extreme events (periods of above average 
sea level).

Wizard is one such tool, which walks the user through five steps to assess vulnerabilities, identify 
adaptation options, implement, monitor and evaluate. This is accompanied by other supports such 
as a risk-based decision-making framework and Local Climate Impacts Profile tool, all of which can be 
applied to sea level rise. A list of climate change adaptation case studies in the U.K. is also available.

adaptation, including the extensive body of work by UKCIP. More information is 
The Environment Agency has produced two recent reports of interest. The 2009 report “Investing for 
the Future: Flood and Coastal Risk Management in England, a Long-term Strategy” outlines current 
flood and coastal erosion risk in the U.K. along with an assessment of the level of investment that would 
be required to manage the increasing risk through 2035. This includes an analysis of the benefits of 
investment and potential for new sources of investment. The study concludes that investment should 
almost double to £1 billion annually (from £570 million in 2009).
In 2010 the Environment Agency released “The Coastal Handbook: A Guide for all Those Working on 
the Coast,” which was developed as a comprehensive resource on information for coastal management 
in the U.K., and to improve understanding by Environment Agency and local government staff, of 
respective roles and responsibilities. A chapter is devoted to “Coastal change, adaptation, resilience and 
land management,” and other supporting information for adapting to sea level rise and coastal erosion 
is included in other sections.
