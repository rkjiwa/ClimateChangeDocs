ADDRESSING CLIMATE AND HEALTH RISKS IN BC

CLIMATE CHANGE  
HEALTH RISKS

The World Health Organization has identified climate change as the biggest global health threat of the 21st century. 
Here in British Columbia, climate change is clearly observable and many people are already feeling its effects. With 
some degree of climate change now locked-in regardless of mitigation efforts, climate change adaptation is necessary 
to ensure British Columbia will fare well in the future. 

The challenge is significant, but British Columbia is well positioned to respond given strong capacity across different 
sectors. There are many specific actions that the larger health community can take to respond and prepare for climate 
change.  These actions often fall within the day-to-day responsibilities of the health care community and align with the 
sector’s overarching goal: improving health and well-being outcomes for all British Columbians.  

CLIMATE CHANGE AND HEALTH
Climate change is likely to impact 
most areas of our lives, including 
our health. In British Columbia, 
the principal hazards include 
rising temperatures, sea level 
rise, and increased frequency 
and intensity of extreme weather 
events. These hazards bring new 
and complex challenges, but by 
working together, we can increase 
our collective knowledge base and 
begin to think more strategically 
about how best to prepare to 
protect health. 

Population and community 
health are influenced by wider 
social, cultural, economic and 
environmental factors. These 
factors are commonly known as 
health determinants, and they are 
closely linked to a range of health 
outcomes. Increasingly, climate 
change hazards are impacting 
health determinants. As illustrated 
in the figure, these impacts in turn 
influence and affect physical and 
mental health outcomes.

OUTCOMES

CLIMATE CHANGE: BC HEALTH RISKS
The table outlines key health and community risks posed by climate change that have been observed in BC. 
Vulnerable groups such as young children, the elderly, people with existing cardiopulmonary and respiratory 
illnesses, low-income families and people with mental wellness challenges are at greater risk.

CLIMATE CHANGE HAZARDS PRIMARY IMPACTS

Storm surges  
(temporary flooding)

Sea level rise

Rising temperatures

Flooding  
(long-term and 
permanent inundation)

More frequent, severe 
and prolonged heat 
waves and urban 
“heat island” effects

Changes in infectious 
agents, introduction 
of new pests, longer 
disease transmission 
seasons in some areas
Increased production 
of pollens and spores
Increased frequency 
and intensity of storms 

More frequent, severe 
and prolonged drought

Extreme weather

Wildfires 

Increased prevalence of water-borne pathogens and contaminants 
Interruption of health services
Increased potential for mold growth
Infrastructure/property damage
