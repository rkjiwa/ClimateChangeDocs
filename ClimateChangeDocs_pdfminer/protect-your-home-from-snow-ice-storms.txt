About the Institute
for Catastrophic Loss Reduction

The Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction (ICLR), established in
1997, is a world-class centre for multidisciplinary disaster prevention
research and communication. ICLR is an independent, not-for-pro!t
research institute founded by the insurance industry and af!liated with
the University of Western Ontario.

The Institute’s mission is to reduce the loss of life and property caused
by severe weather and earthquakes through the identi!cation and
support of sustained actions that improve society’s capacity to adapt
to, anticipate, mitigate, withstand and recover from natural disasters.

ICLR’s mandate is to confront the alarming increase in disaster losses
caused by natural disasters and to work to reduce disaster deaths,
injuries and property damage. Disaster damage has been doubling
every !ve to seven years since the 1960s, an alarming trend. The
greatest tragedy is that many disaster losses are preventable. ICLR is
committed to the development and communication of disaster
prevention knowledge. For the individual homeowner, this translates
into the identi!cation of natural hazards that threaten them and their
home. The Institute further informs individual homeowners about
steps that can be taken to better protect your family and your home.

The purpose of this handbook is to outline actions that
homeowners can take to protect their homes from extreme winter
weather. Some of these measures are simple and free; others cost
money. All contribute to reducing the risk to homeowners from 
winter weather.

The winter weather challenge
for homeowners

Winter weather represents a signi!cant challenge for all Canadians.
For homeowners, in particular, cold temperatures, heavy snowfall
and ice build-ups represent potentially signi!cant sources of property
damage. Frozen pipes, water leaks, and roof damage can easily occur
without adequate preparation for winter weather.

Canada experiences some of the most extreme winter weather in the
world. This weather usually occurs in one of two forms that Canadians
are quite used to: winter storms and extreme cold. The 1998 Ontario
and Quebec ice-storm, for example,
represents one of the most
expensive natural disasters in
Canadian history costing over 
$5.4 billion to recover from its
damage. A thick layer of freezing
rain coated hydro towers, electricity
and telephone lines leaving over 
4 million people in Ontario, Quebec
and New Brunswick without power. 

All areas of Canada have also
experienced temperatures below
-40 C (except for Prince Edward
Island). During “cold snaps” when the temperature drops for sustained
periods of time, homeowners battle frozen pipes, which can lead to
ruptures and signi!cant water damage. 

Most research on preparing for winter weather focuses on taking
precaution while driving, or how to dress to keep warm during
extreme cold, but does not inform homeowners on how to minimize
damage from such weather. This handbook is designed to address this
gap. It identi!es several steps homeowners can take to protect their
homes from extreme winter weather and provides a scorecard that 
can help evaluate potential vulnerability.

First steps

Understand your home’s vulnerabilities
Roof collapse, roof or ice dams, and frozen pipes are the major
threats to homeowners during periods of extreme winter weather. It is
important to be aware and educated about your home’s vulnerabilities
to these threats. 

Talk to your local government

1
Local governments often offer important advice for homeowners on
how to protect their home from winter weather. Municipal government
websites, public works, utilities and the building department are all
useful sources. Towns and cities located in “snow belt” regions, which
traditionally receive signi!cant amounts of snowfall, will be able offer 
a great deal of expertise on how to protect your home.

왘 What advice do they offer?
왘 How do you report damage from extreme winter weather?
왘 What does your local government suggest you do?
왘 Is there any disaster-relief assistance you can apply for?
왘 Do they recommend contractors with expertise in winter-weather

protection?

왘 What permits, if any, are required to strengthen your home’s defenses?

Talk to your insurance agent or broker

2
It is critical that homeowners talk to insurance agents and brokers 
to understand what types of damage is covered under their policy.
Sometimes speci!c types of damage can be excluded depending on
your policy or the municipality where you live. Insurers can also identify
common sources of damage in your subdivision that you should 
watch out for. 

Have a building inspector evaluate your home

3
Because each home is different, building inspectors can offer important
insights into your home’s capacity to withstand winter weather.
Inspectors can provide important information on the age of your home
(ie. the interior plumbing), and your roof’s capacity to handle heavy
snow loads. Contacting your municipality is one way to !nd a good
home inspector with knowledge on your area.

Taking action on your own

These actions will not guarantee the safety of your home, but can help
minimize and prevent winter weather damage. 

Protecting Your Home
Full or partial roof collapse, ice dams and frozen pipes are the major
threats that homeowner’s should be aware of during periods of
extreme winter weather. Heavy snowfall and ice build up can threaten
your roof’s structural integrity, but also lead to water damage as snow
or ice melts and seeps into your home. Extreme cold snaps can freeze
pipes, which can cause signi!cant water damage if the pipe bursts.

Roof collapse can occur after a signi!cant snowfall, freezing rain, 
or a series of intermittent snow or ice events throughout the winter
season. The !rst step in preventing roof collapse is to determine
whether your roof is susceptible to signi!cant snow or ice
accumulation. Your roof’s
slope is the most
important factor in helping
shed snow or melting
water. The lower the
slope, the more exposed
your roof is towards heavy
snow and ice build-up. 

According to most
builders, a “4 on 12” roof
with a slope that is greater
than 10cm (vertically) in
30cm (horizontally) will
shed most snow and ice.
But even with a sloped roof, snow and ice can still build up on "atter
areas of the roof. Obstructions, such as chimneys, skylights or dormers,
are particularly susceptible to snow build-up. 

Roof collapse can be a stressful and expensive 
experience for homeowners..

Snow can collect behind roof obstructions, such as the ones pictured above. 
These include vents, chimneys or gables

In the aftermath of signi!cant snow or ice event, there are several
important indicators a homeowner can use to determine if a sloped
roof is under structural stress from snow or ice. The Canadian
Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) recommends that
homeowners check for1:
왘 New water leaks inside the house originating from the roof 

or attic area.

왘 New internal door jams. If doors become dif!cult to open, it could

be a result of additional snow or ice loads on the roof.

왘 New cracks in the drywall or plaster could also result from additional

snow load or ice weight in the centre of the house.

왘 On sloped roofs, sagging on the ridge-line (where the two sides of
the roof meet) could be an indication of a potential roof collapse.

If you see any of these above indicators it is important that you
immediately take action to reduce the snow or ice load from the roof.
There are several actions a homeowner can take. For snow, the safest
approach is to contact a snow removal contractor. But a long snow-
rake with an extendable arm can also be purchased if you can access
areas of the roof with signi!cant snow accumulation from the ground.

Removing ice build-up represents a more signi!cant challenge for
homeowners. Homeowners can choose to drain, or physically remove
ice that has formed on the roof. For a sloped roof, drainage can
signi!cantly reduce the impact of potential ice damage.

The !rst step is to carefully remove any loose snow that covers the 
ice. Once the ice is exposed, you can take advantage of the sloped
roof by trying to make drainage paths so that the ice can melt and run
off the roof.
왘 Electric Heating Cables offer the easiest approach to removing ice.
Installing heating cables can be dif!cult depending on the design of
your roof. It is often advisable to call a professional contractor with
experience in installing heating cables for advice. 

왘 Chemical de-icers can also be used to improve drainage. The

easiest approach is to make a hole in the ice approximately every
three feet that exposes the roof surface. De-icer can be placed in
each hole and then in a line towards the edge of the roof. 

Manual ice-removal should be a last-resort option for homeowners.
This process is extremely dangerous and should be done by a professional.

Ice dams
Ice dams represent one of the most common sources of roof damage
for Canadians. An ice dam is a ridge of ice that develops at the edge
of your roof or around drains that prevents snow or water from
melting off your roof. Heat escaping from the interior of your house in

Ice dams form when heat escapes from your attic 
or the interior of your home and melts snow on 
your roof.

combination with poor attic air circulation is the primary cause of ice
dams. As snow hits your roof it can melt in the areas where heat is
escaping. Water will run down the roof towards the edges where it
can come in contact with the colder eave and freeze. As the ice forms,
water trying to drain down the roof will build up behind the “dam”

5

ICLR-SL Snow&Ice-D11 Jun18-12 E-FINAL_x  12-06-18  12:32 PM  Page 6

and potentially leak into walls, ceilings or your attic. This water may
cause rot in the roof that leads to collapse. In addition, the “dam” 
also limits snow from falling off your roof, which can add to existing
snowloads and put pressure on the structure of your home. 

Prevention remains the most effective strategy for stopping ice dams.
Homeowners can take several steps to prevent heat from escaping
your attic or the interior of your house. 

왘 Look for any attic penetrations such

as attic doors, plumbing stacks,
electrical service penetrations, or
chimneys that allow heat to escape
from inside your house into the attic.
왘 Identify and remove any heat source

in your attic that will heat areas on
your roof. 

Incandescent light !xtures in the ceiling below
the attic can often generate enough heat to
melt snow on a roof. 

왘 Incandescent light !xtures in the
ceiling below the attic can often
generate enough heat to melt
snow on a roof. These !xtures
should be insulated to prevent any heat loss. Homeowners can
check for proper insulation by looking for any light from the !xture 
in the attic.

왘 Look for any form of penetration between your attic and roof, such

as a vent. If you can see sunlight from the outside, the vent will
need to be sealed or insulated.

Re-roo!ng also offers another
opportunity to prevent ice dams.
During installation homeowners can
install a secondary moisture or snow
and ice barrier to prevent heat loss. 
To make sure the barrier is effective
homeowners should consider using
two layers of underlayment that are
cemented together.  

Snow and ice shield.

Also, make sure underlayment is installed in roof valleys where snow
and ice can collect during the winter. 

There are also a series of less costly steps a homeowner can take if ice
dams are a continuing problem.
Increasing the insulation above your
ceilings can help prevent heat from
escaping into your attic or through
your roof. For suspended ceilings,
!bre glass batt insulation can be
installed to prevent heat loss. For
drywall ceilings that are nailed
directly to the joists, blown insulation
in addition to !bre glass insulation
can be effective. 

Roof maintenance is also a key
measure homeowners can take to
prevent ice dams. It is important to
make sure that roof drainage
systems, such as scuppers, gutters
and down spouts are free of debris
and working properly. Blockages can
prevent water from draining.
Overhanging trees or vegetation
should be cut back to prevent debris
from landing on your roof and
clogging these drains. 

For some homes, especially those
with aging drainage systems that are
surrounded by trees, this type of
preventative maintenance may still
not stop ice dams. In this case, a
heating cable installed on the gutter
or downspout may be necessary. 

Fibre glass insulation can signi!cantly reduce
heat loss from your home.

Blocked gutters can stop water from draining
from your roof and cause ice dams.

Frozen Pipes
Frozen pipes are one of the most signi!cant sources of damage for
homeowners linked with winter weather. When a pipe freezes, water

can back up behind the blockage and cause a rupture leading to
signi!cant property damage. Homeowners can take a number of steps
before winter arrives to prepare their plumbing system for a drop 
in temperature.
왘 Make sure insulation is installed on any exposed pipe, speci!cally

those in a closet of an attic. Heat tape or heat cables are two
options homeowners can explore for insulated exposed pipes.

왘 Identify and seal any leaks that expose pipes to cold air. Attics often
hold cold air that can seep into the house and lower temperatures. It
is important to insulate any attic penetration, such as a partition
wall, vent, plumbing stack, electric or mechanical chases. Access
doors into the attic must also be property sealed to protect a home
from cold air in the attic. Homeowners should make sure that all
wall cracks or penetrations are sealed, particularly around domestic
and !re protection lines and electrical conduits. 

왘 Disconnect garden hoses and shut the indoor valves that control
water "ow to the outside of the house. Drain the pipe between 
the indoor valve and the outdoor faucet.Despite these precautionary
steps, extreme drops in the temperature can still cause pipes 
to freeze. Simple steps to protect your home during these cold 
snaps include: 

8

ICLR-SL Snow&Ice-D11 Jun18-12 E-FINAL_x  12-06-18  12:32 PM  Page 9

 

 

왘 Paying attention to local weather forecasts that predict extreme cold

weather. Opening your taps to allow a drip of water to keep water
moving. This is really important for pipes in exterior walls that are
more exposed to cooler temperatures. 

왘 Maintaining a consistent thermostat temperature during the day and

at night. Turning down the thermostat at night, for example, can
expose some pipes to extremely low temperatures.

왘 Pipes under sinks or appliances are usually not insulated, so opening
kitchen and sink cabinets can open access to warmer air circulating
throughout the house.

왘 Keep the garage door closed. Sometimes water pipes can run

through the garage if it is attached to the home. An open door can
expose these pipes to extremely low temperatures.

If you are leaving your home for any extended period of time during
the winter, homeowners can help prevent frozen pipes upon their
return in a number of ways. 
왘 Make sure the thermostat is set no lower than

12C (54F). 

왘 Ask a neighbour to check on the house at

least every other day to make sure the
temperature is not too low. 

왘 Before you leave, drain your water system.

It is important that during cold snaps
that the temperature is not set any
lower than 12 Celcius.

Power outages are one of the more common
causes of frozen pipes. Without power, the
water supply may also shut off. If you do not
"ush water out of the pipes it can easily freeze. During the 1998
Montreal Ice Storm, for example, power outages led to signi!cant
damage in many homes from frozen pipes.
왘 If water is no longer coming into your home, turn off the main
water valve coming into your home. Open all taps to clear the
remaining water in the pipes.

왘Homeowners should ensure that they can access a back-up power

supply, such as a stand-by generator. 

9

ICLR-SL Snow&Ice-D11 Jun18-12 E-FINAL_x  12-06-18  12:32 PM  Page 10

왘 Central monitoring companies can also be hired to provide

noti!cation in the event the interior temperature of the home gets
too low. 

왘 If your home uses a sprinkler system, make sure that it is monitored

by a central station in case a rupture occurs due to freezing
temperatures.
