About the Institute
for Catastrophic Loss Reduction

The Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction (ICLR), established in
1997, is a world-class centre for multidisciplinary disaster prevention
research and communication. ICLR is an independent, not-for-pro!t
research institute founded by the insurance industry and af!liated with
the University of Western Ontario.

The Institute’s mission is to reduce the loss of life and property caused
by severe weather and earthquakes through the identi!cation and
support of sustained actions that improve society’s capacity to adapt
to, anticipate, mitigate, withstand and recover from natural disasters.

ICLR’s mandate is to confront the alarming increase in disaster losses
caused by natural disasters and to work to reduce disaster deaths,
injuries and property damage. Disaster damage has been doubling
every !ve to seven years since the 1960s, an alarming trend. 

The greatest tragedy is that many disaster losses are preventable. 
ICLR is committed to the development and communication of disaster
prevention knowledge. This document identi!es the steps you can take
to better protect your home from wild!res.

Wild!res

Fire is a natural process essential to maintain healthy forests. Wildland
!res can also be a terrifying peril that threatens lives and property.

Wild!res burn on average 20,000 km2 of forest each year in Canada.
When these !res approach our communities they can force families 
to evacuate. In !ghting these !res, !re!ghters are sometimes called
upon to make decisions on which properties can be defended and
which cannot. 

Over the last several centuries, large
parts of Canada have burned
repeatedly. 50 per cent of Canada’s
wild!res are caused by people.
Most of the other half is caused by
lightning strikes on dry forest. This
is why the risk of wild!res is highest
in the summer.

If you live in or near a forested area,
you’re living in an area often
referred to as the wildland/urban
interface and sooner or later you
may have to contend with a wild!re. The risk of wild!res is increasing
in many parts of Canada and your best protection against loss,
damage or injury is prevention. 

ICLR has partnered with the Government of Alberta to distribute the
FireSmart Home Owners Manual. This material details the speci!c
actions that Canadians should take in order to protect their homes
from wild!res.

Get ready

Properly preparing your home and community doesn’t completely
guarantee you won’t incur !re damage, but it does reduce the risk.
Make sure you have adequate insurance on your home and property.

Some of the measures in this manual cost very little and help reduce
your vulnerability to wild!re; others require planning and a long-term
commitment.

Let’s look at three areas where you can apply FireSmart principles to
protect or reduce the damage to your property from a wild!re. 

1. Site preparation 

Priority zone 3

Priority zone 2

Priority zone 1

10 m

20 m

70 m

Priority zones surronding an interface
building or group of buildings.

Any kind of vegetation is
combustible. 
Mature trees, shrubs, grass and even your
woodpile can easily ignite and increase the
chance of wild!re damaging your home and
property. Managing the space around your
home and buildings is of utmost importance.

Do you have a cleared zone around
your house and buildings? 
The 10-metre space immediately surrounding
your home is Priority Zone 1. It’s the most
critical area to introduce FireSmart principles.

A fuel-free space will give !re!ghters a chance to save your home
from an advancing wild!re. A home without a fuel-free space can
make !re!ghting dif!cult, if not impossible. 

What to do? 
Remove "ammable trees and shrubs, such as
pine, spruce and juniper. Other species such
as aspen, poplar and birch have lower
"ammability rates. Also remove deadfall or
woodpiles from this area. Keep your grass
mowed and watered.

ICLR-SL Wildfire-D14 Jun18 12 E-FINAL_x  12-06-18  12:28 PM  Page 3

How FireSmart is your “Second Priority” zone? 
The area extending from 10 to 30 metres away from your home is
Priority Zone 2. In this zone, you need to reduce fuels by thinning and
pruning trees so that intense wild!res don’t have as much fuel to burn.

What to do? 
Remove any trees and debris that would support the rapid spread of 
a wild!re. Make sure to thin or space trees so that the crowns (tops) 
of individual trees are at least 3 to 6 metres apart. 

Remove tree branches up to 2 metres from the ground. Also remove
thick shrubbery and deadfall to reduce the chance that a wild!re will
climb up into the forest canopy. Once a wild!re is crowning, it’s very
dif!cult to stop.

Because !res spread more easily uphill and downwind it’s important 
to extend Priority Zone 2 further on downhill slopes and on windward
exposures. 

Can you extend your FireSmart maintenance
plan to the “Third Priority” zone? 
Priority Zone 3 begins
30 metres from your home
and extends to a distance
of 100 metres and
beyond. In this zone the
objective is not to remove
all combustible fuels from
the forest, but to thin the
area so !res will be low-
intensity and more easily
extinguished. 

Low stand density where
trees are widely spaced.

Tree crowns do not touch
or overlap.

What to do? 
Thin or reduce the shrubs and trees that make up the understory. Try
to keep !re-resistant trees such as aspen, poplar and birch, while
spacing more "ammable trees so that each individual crown is at least
3 to 6 metres apart.

These are… 
simple economical steps anyone can take
to create a FireSmart home, community
or business site. To ensure years of
protection, make sure you maintain your
FireSmart Priority Zones. 

Lawn or non-combustible material 
왘 within 10 metres of building (0 pts). 
왘 within 10 to 30 metres of building (0 pts). 

2. Building construction

The second set of FireSmart guidelines deals with building materials
and design standards. While it may not be practical or economical to
apply all of them to an existing structure, many FireSmart
modi!cations are easily accomplished. Others can be included in long-
term maintenance or renovation plans, and incorporated in new
structures as they are designed and constructed.

Metal, clay tile, asphalt shingles, or
non-combustible material (0 pts) – the
most !re resistant and remain effective
under severe !re exposure.

Unrated wood shakes (30 pts) – provide
no !re protection. 

Is your roof FireSmart? 
The most !re-resistant roo!ng materials are metal, clay tile and asphalt
shingles. Untreated wooden shakes and shingles provide no resistance.
They are ideal fuels for an advancing wild!re. 

4

ICLR-SL Wildfire-D14 Jun18 12 E-FINAL_x  12-06-18  12:28 PM  Page 5

Ensure your roof is free of combustible needles and leaves and there
are no overhanging trees or branches that can provide fuel for
airborne sparks and embers. 

Are your exterior walls
FireSmart? 
Materials such as stucco, metal,
brick and concrete offer superior
resistance to wild!re. Logs and
heavy timber are less effective,
and wood and vinyl siding offer
very little protection.

Non-combustible siding (0 pts) 
Materials such as stucco, metal siding, brick cement
shingles, concrete block, poured concrete, and rock
offer superior !re resistance.

Is the exterior of your
home vulnerable to !rebrand ignition? 
If you are designing your home, eliminate areas where !rebrands
(airborne sparks and embers) could accumulate and ignite siding,
windowsills or trim. Exterior siding should be !re-resistant and extend
from ground level to the roo"ine. 

Eaves and vents are ready-made openings that can allow heat and
embers to enter a building and ignite. Ensure eaves are closed in and

screen all vents and sof!ts. Keep areas under decks and porches clear
of debris and sheath the undersides with !re-resistant material.

FireSmart? 
Be sure to remove "ammable forest fuels
within 10 metres of glazed window and
door openings. Tempered, thermal or
smaller double-pane windows will
provide far greater protection than single
pane glass.

3. Don’t be the cause

of a wild!re

Wild!res often start as small accidental ignitions. You can help prevent
an accidental wild!re from starting by using FireSmart standards
around your property.

FireSmart your chimney 
Chimneys should be constructed to
meet current building code requirements
and have approved spark arrestors
installed.

Burn barrels and !re pits 
Burn barrels and !re pits should be
located away from buildings and 3
metres away from other combustible
material. Always ensure your burn barrel
has proper ventilation and is covered
with a screen. Never leave your burn
barrel or !re pit unattended while it is in
use. For a safer method of disposal bring
your debris to a local land!ll site. 

Power lines and propane tanks 
Vegetation should be cleared away from
power lines, propane tanks and other
fuel supplies.

Emergency facilities 
Ensure your property has adequate
emergency vehicle access and an on-site
emergency water supply, such as a
pond, tank, creek or lake.
