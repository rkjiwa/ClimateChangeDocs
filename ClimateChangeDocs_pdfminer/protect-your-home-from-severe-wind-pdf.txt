About the Institute
for Catastrophic Loss Reduction

The Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction (ICLR), established in
1997, is a world-class centre for multidisciplinary disaster prevention
research and communication. ICLR is an independent, not-for-pro!t
research institute founded by the insurance industry and af!liated with
the University of Western Ontario.

The Institute’s mission is to reduce the loss of life and property caused
by severe weather and earthquakes through the identi!cation and
support of sustained actions that improve society’s capacity to adapt
to, anticipate, mitigate, withstand and recover from natural disasters.

ICLR’s mandate is to confront the alarming increase in disaster losses
caused by natural disasters and to work to reduce disaster deaths,
injuries and property damage. Disaster damage has been doubling
every !ve to seven years since the 1960s, an alarming trend. The
greatest tragedy is that many disaster losses are preventable. ICLR is
committed to the development and communication of disaster
prevention knowledge. For the individual homeowner, this translates
into the identi!cation of natural hazards that threaten them and their
home. The Institute further informs individual homeowners about
steps that can be taken to better protect your family and your home.

The purpose of this booklet is to outline actions that homeowners
can take to protect their homes from tornadoes and severe wind
damage. Some of these measures are simple and free; others cost
money. All contribute to reducing the risk of severe wind damage.

Tornado damage

Tornadoes appear in many shapes and sizes, but are typically in the form
of violent rotating columns of air extending from a thunderstorm with 
a narrow end touching the ground. Most tornadoes have wind speeds
of less than 170 km/h and a width of 75m across. They typically travel
several kilometers before dissipating. Extreme tornadoes can easily
uproot trees, "ip cars and demolish houses with wind speeds of more
than 480 km/h. They can stretch more than three kilometres across 
and travel more than 100 km. 

Canada experiences more tornadoes than any other country (80 on
average) with the exception of the United States. Tornadoes are
relatively common in certain regions in Canada, including: the British
Columbia interior, southern areas of Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba,
Ontario and Quebec, and western New Brunswick. They can occur 
at any time of the year but
are most prevalent from April
to September with peak
months in June and July. 

Hospitals and public
buildings are typically “fully
engineered” and perform
well in high winds because of
the attention given to
construction connections (joints, fasteners) and load paths (the path 
that seismic forces pass through to the foundation of the structure).
Historically, less engineering oversight has been applied to residential
construction, making it especially vulnerable to severe wind damage. 

With population and development increasing in at-risk areas, tornado
and severe wind activity has serious implications for homeowners across
Canada. While homeowners cannot predict violent wind activity, they
can take steps to protect themselves and minimize damage to their
homes. This handbook is designed to assist homeowners who are at risk
of tornadoes and severe winds. It identi!es several steps homeowners
can take to protect their homes from severe wind damage and provides
a scorecard that can help evaluate potential vulnerability.

First steps

Understand your home’s vulnerabilities
While tornadoes and severe winds can easily destroy homes, most
often the result is damage to the home’s roof, exterior walls and
windows. It is important to be aware and educated about your home’s
vulnerabilities to the threat of severe winds.

Talk to your local government

1
Local government’s often offer important advice for homeowners on
how to protect their home from severe winds. Municipal government
websites, public works, utilities and the building department are all
useful sources. Towns and cities located in severe wind regions can
offer a great deal of expertise on how to protect your home.

Some key questions worth asking
왘 What advice do they offer?
왘 Are there engineering studies on your subdivision?
왘 How do you report damage from extreme winds and storms?
왘 What does your local government suggest you do?
왘 Is there any disaster-relief assistance you can apply for?
왘 Do they recommend any contractors with expertise in severe

wind protection?

왘 What permits are required to strengthen your home’s defenses?

Talk to your insurance agent or broker

2
It is critical that homeowner’s talk to insurance agents and brokers 
to understand what types of damage are covered under their policy.
Sometimes speci!c types of damage can be excluded depending 

on your policy. Insurers can also identify common sources of
damage in your subdivision that you should watch out for. 

Have a building inspector evaluate your home

3
Because each home is different, building inspectors can offer
important insights into your home’s capacity to withstand
storm-force winds. Inspectors can provide important
information on the age of your home, and its capacity to resist
extreme winds. Contacting your municipality is the easiest way
to !nd a good home inspector with knowledge on your area.

Taking action on your own

These initiatives cannot guarantee the safety and security of any home
but, if addressed, will help to minimize tornado and severe wind damage.

Storm-proof the roof
Tornado damage is usually most signi!cant for a home’s roof. Strong
winds generate uplift as they divide and "ow around a structure. The
wind stream following the longest path (usually over the roof) speeds
up to rejoin the stream following the shorter distance (usually around
the walls). According to
Bernoulli's principle, as the
wind speeds up across the
roof the pressure drops. This
generates uplift. The roof, in
effect, acts somewhat like a
wing and attempts to “take
off” from the remainder of
the building. 

Roof sheathing must be securely fastened to prevent
wind damage.

If the roof is old or showing
signs of damage or decay, 
re-roo!ng can signi!cantly
strengthen a home against
strong winds. The roof cover
should be removed down 
to the sheathing. Sheathing
should be checked for 
any damage and replaced 
as needed. 

Choose a high-wind rated
roof cover and make sure
ridge and off-ridge vents are
also rated for high winds. If a
homeowner is not ready to
re-roof, check vents to be
sure they will stay in place and are of the proper type and strength to
resist high winds and wind-driven rain. Shutter any vents before a
storm strikes or replace them with products rated for resistance to

High winds are a major cause of roof damage.

wind-driven rain intrusion. If water accumulates in the attic,
homeowners could soon !nd themselves facing problems with mildew,
mold and rot.

Strengthen the fastening of the roof sheathing to the roof structure
and provide a secondary water barrier by having a closed cell
urethane-based adhesive spray foam applied from inside your attic. 
Gable end roofs are more
susceptible to damage from
high winds than hip roofs or
"at roofs because they slope
in only two directions (and
not four). The gable end
presents a large obstacle to
the wind and receives its full
force. If the framing of the
gable end and the rest of the
roof is not adequately braced
to resist the wind, the roof

can fail. Roof failures, especially in
unbraced gable roofs, are a common
cause of major damage to houses and
their contents in high winds. 

A gable roof can be strengthened by
installing additional braces in the trusses
and/or at the gable ends. A quali!ed
builder can also install galvanized metal

Some examples of metal hurricane straps.

hurricane straps. These help to secure the roof to the walls. Large
gable end walls should be braced and tied into the roof and ceiling
structure to keep them from being damaged during a violent storm.

Entry doors
If a home’s doors fail under signi!cant pressure, they will allow wind 
to enter the house which can cause even more damage and possibly
injure homeowners and members of their family. Doors should be
pressure- and impact-rated or shuttered with a pressure- and impact-
rated product. Keep at least one protected entry door operable from 

4

ICLR-SL SevereWind D10 Jun18-12-E-FINAL_x  12-06-18  12:35 PM  Page 5

inside the home. Most doors do not have bolts or pins strong enough
to withstand tornadoes and severe winds. Many houses are equipped
with double entry doors. These doors typically consist of an “active”
door (which is used when only one door is needed) and an “inactive”
door (which usually remains closed but can be opened when
necessary). While these doors are convenient because they span a
wider opening than a single door, they are usually not as strong as 
a single door and are therefore more susceptible to wind damage.
Double-entry doors can be reinforced by adding a heavy-duty dead
bolt, slide bolts at the top and bottom of the inactive door and longer
hinge attachment screws into the doors and frame. 

Windows and sliding glass doors
Although tornadoes and severe winds can exert tremendous pressure
against homes, a signi!cant portion of property damage is not from
the wind itself but from airborne materials. Items such as tree limbs
and branches, signs and sign
posts, roof tiles and shingles,
metal siding and other pieces
of buildings (including entire
roofs in major storms) can
easily penetrate unprotected
windows and sliding doors.
This wind-borne debris can
cause signi!cant damage to
interior walls and ceilings not
designed to withstand such
forces. As well, wind
penetration results in the
uncontrolled build-up of
internal air pressure which
can weaken the structure. 

Flying debris from severe winds can easily penetrate
unprotected windows. 

The easiest and most effective way to protect windows and glass doors
is to install storm shutters. Building supply stores sell many kinds of
storm shutters, but homeowners can also make their own shutters out
of plywood. Use 5/8” marine plywood, cut to !t and ready to install. 

5

ICLR-SL SevereWind D10 Jun18-12-E-FINAL_x  12-06-18  12:35 PM  Page 6

Permanently install any necessary wall-mounted hardware for
removable shutters before a storm threatens. Number all shutters and
keep all of the removable hardware accessible for quick installation.

Porches and overhangs
Porches and overhangs are obvious targets for storm-force wind
damage. They protrude from homes and are typically constructed with
lighter materials (wood vs. bricks). Porches and overhangs are
frequently the initial points for structural damage in a violent storm.
Many of the columns that support porch roofs or overhangs provide
adequate support for the weight of the roof but offer little resistance
to uplift forces. In a violent storm, these forces can actually be much
larger than the weight of the roof it is expected to support. Make sure
that the columns are adequately connected so that they hold the roof
down, as well as holding it up. 

Garage Doors
While garage doors may be the largest and weakest opening of a
home, they are often forgotten when storm-proo!ng. If the garage
door fails during a storm, the full fury of the storm may enter the

home and blow off the roof
and destroy the home.
Homeowners should look for
a sticker indicating pressure
rating suitable for their
location. If there is no sticker,
consider three options:
왘 Install a garage door with

one that is pressure-rated or
pressure- and impact-rated.

왘 Install aftermarket vertical

braces that are building
code approved and
available at a local home
improvement store.

Garage doors can be the weakest opening 
of a home in a severe wind storm.

왘 Check with the garage  door manufacturer for a kit to strengthen

the door and its track so that it has the properties found in new
wind-rated doors appropriate for your location. Garage doors 

6

ICLR-SL SevereWind D10 Jun18-12-E-FINAL_x  12-06-18  12:35 PM  Page 7

can be strengthened by installing horizontal bracing in each panel.
Bracing kits can often be purchased from garage door manufacturers.
Homeowners may also need to add stronger supports and heavier
hinges for their garage doors.

Ridge and off-ridge vents
Faulty ridge vents can result in signi!cant water intrusion in high
winds. Driven by storm-force winds, water can enter homes through
usually rain-tight openings and completely devastate a home's interior
and contents. Ridge vents should be rated for water intrusion
resistance. Given that they are the last item installed, ridge vents can
be easily replaced. Look for a baf"e or trip that keeps water from
being pushed up into the vent so that the rain is pulled away. The vent
should be adequately fastened to the roof deck. Consider replacing
any off-ridge vents that are not rated for high-wind applications and
wind-driven rain resistance. Consult a reputable roofer in such cases.

Sof!ts
During a storm, the eaves of a home can expose the structure to the
ravages of wind-driven rain on two fronts. The most obvious danger
comes when sof!ts are blown
out during a storm. Water
intrusion can also occur when
strong winds drive water
through vented sof!ts.
Homeowners should check
the condition of their sof!t
covers (the plastic or
aluminum cover underneath
the roof edge in between the
eave and wall). If the sof!t is
damaged, it should be
replaced. Replace corroded
material covers. Check the
attachment to the wall and
eaves. Panels 12 inches or longer perpendicular to the wall should
have a wood support near the middle of the panel. To help anchor the
sof!ts of a home, apply a bead of polyurethane sealant between the

wall and the trim into which the sof!t panels are inserted. A
homeowner can also apply a dollop of caulk in the V-shaped hole
where the joint between two sof!t panels meets the trim.

Outdoor objects
Loose items can become a !re hazard when they accumulate near 
a home. They can also pose a signi!cant danger around a home if
picked up by high winds during a violent storm. Be sure to trim any
trees and shrubs around the home. Remove any dead or rotted trees,
branches, or bushes, as well as other debris from around the yard. 

Turn off propane tanks. Make sure all items in the yard (e.g., storage
sheds, lawn furniture, garbage cans and grills) are secure and heavy
enough to stay put under normal conditions. Never leave a patio
umbrella up when not in use as it can easily be picked up by the wind
and turned into a missile. Consider replacing gravel or rock
landscaping materials with shredded bark. Store vehicles in a garage 
or other enclosure. 

Moor boats securely. If the boat is ashore on a jack stand, strap the
boat down where possible. If there is a pool on the property, cover 
the pump !lter.
