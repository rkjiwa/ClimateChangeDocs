events that have direct effects on people and 
property, to fundamental changes to ecosystems 
that may undermine local economies, increase 
human health risks from infectious and non-
infectious diseases, and affect the availability 
and quality of water.  Climate change is, without 
a doubt, a real threat to our sustainability and 
quality of life.   
 
The Ontario Ministry of Municipal Affairs and 
Housing, together with Natural Resources 
Canada and the Institute for Catastrophic Loss 
Reduction, supported the development of this 
Guide to help municipalities understand and 
manage risks associated with climate variability 
and change and remaining uncertainties about 
future changes.  This is an important tool that 
can assist municipalities, Conservation 
Authorities and others, to reduce their 
vulnerabilities to the adverse impacts, of our 
changing climate. 

Foreword 
 
 
The Ontario government is committed to helping 
our communities to be strong, healthy and 
prosperous.  That is why we have developed 
policies to improve the air we breathe, ensure 
the quality of the water we drink, promote clean, 
reliable energy supply, and reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions.  That is also why we support our 
communities’ efforts to manage risks associated 
with the impacts of climate variability and 
change. 
 
Ontario’s climate has changed over the last 35 
years, and despite our best efforts to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions, will continue to 
change well into the future. Our climate is 
projected to warm by 2˚-3˚C over the next 50 
years and to become increasingly variable.  
These are not insignificant changes – by 
comparison, the Earth’s mean temperature has 
warmed only 4-5°C since the last ice age. 
 
These changes are beginning to have severe 
impacts, from more frequent and severe climate

1.  Introduction 

 

Global climate change is widely recognized as 
one of the world’s greatest environmental, social 
and economic threats.  In Canada, climate 
changes observed over the past 35 to 40 years 
account in part for the exponential rise in 
economic losses from extreme weather events, 
premature weathering of infrastructure, stresses 
on water supplies, worsening air quality and 
related health and economic impacts, among 
other effects on Canadians’ quality of life and 
economy.   
Efforts to adapt to and manage climate-related 
risks are not keeping pace with the challenges.  
Unfortunately, Canadians are becoming more 
vulnerable to impacts related to climate 
variability and change, due in part to increasing 
urbanisation, a growing and aging population 
and deteriorating public infrastructures.  These 
changes put more people and property at risk 
and the climate will almost certainly continue to 
warm and become increasingly variable over the 
coming decades. 
Municipalities share in many of the 
responsibilities for managing risks from a 
changing climate.   Most Canadians live in 
municipalities, and municipalities have primary 
responsibility for, or can significantly influence, 
many of the factors that determine Canadians’ 
vulnerabilities to climate-related risks. 
The Ontario Municipal Act (2001), the Provincial 
Policy Statement (2005), the Emergency 
Management Act (2003) and the Conservation 
Authorities Act all require in one way or another 
that municipalities and Conservation Authorities 
in Ontario take action to prevent, mitigate or 
respond to threats to human health and safety, 
public property and the environment.  More 
detail on these requirements and why 
municipalities and Conservation Authorities 
need this Guide – including how to respond to 
various pieces of provincial and federal 
legislation and directions can be found at Annex 
2. 
More and more, municipal officials are 
responding to the need to begin implementing 
adaptive strategies by raising their 
understanding of climate change and promoting 
adaptation responses.  Unfortunately, few tools 
exist to help them in the process. This Guide is 

 

1

intended to help meet this need and to assist 
municipal planners, health officials, emergency 
management staffs and conservation authorities 
make optimal choices to adapt to a changing 
and more variable climate. 

1.1.  About the Guide 
This Guide presents a risk-based approach that 
can be used to facilitate municipalities’ efforts to 
adapt to climate change through both longer-
term planning and short-term responses.   It is 
envisioned to be used in three principal ways to 
assist municipal staff and risk management 
teams in planning and implementing adaptation 
strategies: 
•  As a reference manual for users to 

incorporate risk management into ongoing 
municipal planning and management 
activities, particularly those related to 
climate adaptation.  It can also guide 
comprehensive strategic planning initiatives 
focussed on climate adaptation for all 
municipal operations. 

•  To illustrate successful examples and 

methods for managing climate-related risks 
to help build support for adaptation efforts.   

•  As a training facilitation tool for municipal 

staff. 

The Guide is intended primarily for Ontario 
municipalities and Conservation Authorities 
which share responsibilities for planning and 
managing important climate-sensitive systems in 
Ontario.  It was developed to reflect their priority 
issues and processes.  However, while 
examples of use of the Guide are drawn from 
the Ontario situation, the techniques outlined 
can be used in other regions of Canada. 
The Guide clearly shows through its descriptive 
text and the illustrative examples that using the 
risk management process can be a very simple, 
quick and logical process to help users 
determine optimum solutions to complex issues 
involving risk, such as climate adaptation.  It can 
also be used for larger, more scientifically 
oriented risk management projects. 
It is hoped that the Guide will be also be useful 
for regions and institutions to help them 

 

understand risk management techniques and 
how they can be applied to climate change risks.  
Chapter 2 provides insights into the changes in 
climate in Ontario for which Ontario 
municipalities will have to make adaptation 
decisions.  It offers some suggestions to help 
officials integrate a risk-based approach into the 
planning process.   
Chapter (cid:31)3 is an overview of the risk 
management process, and explains why it is 
useful.  During the1990’s a team of Canadian 
risk management experts developed a National 
Standard for risk-based decision-making. The 
benefits of having a nationally consistent 
process are beginning to be realised. 
Chapter 4 explains each step in the process in 
detail and includes: 

•  A description of the purpose of each step; 
•  An explanation of what to do and how to do 

it; 

•  A description of the expected output; 
•  A description of the decision to be made at 

the end of each step; 

•  An example showing how the step could be 

used; and 

•  A checklist of the major tasks at each step in 

the process. 

The examples are based on the experiences of 
municipal and conservation authority 
participants discussed in a two-day workshop on 
climate change risk management held in June 
2005 in Halton Region.  

1.2.  Risk management, adaptation 

and vulnerability reduction 

Climate change literature refers to “adaptation”, 
“adaptive capacity” and “vulnerability”: 

•  Adaptation to climate change refers to 

adjustments in natural or human systems 
that moderate harm or exploit beneficial 
opportunities arising out of actual or 
expected climatic changes  

•  Adaptive capacity is ability of a system, 

region or community to adapt. 

•  Vulnerability refers to how susceptible 

systems are to adverse effects of climate 
change or climate variability including socio-
economic aspects.  

 

2

Adaptation to climate change, which includes 
efforts to enhance adaptive capacity, is typically 
aimed at reducing vulnerability to its adverse 
effects. 
Risk management offers a framework for 
identifying, understanding and prioritising 
climate change risks and for selecting optimal 
adaptation responses to reduce risks to 
acceptable levels. 
 
1.3.  Why risk management? 
Adaptation to climate change is characterized by 
uncertainty, complexity and risk.   It can involve 
multiple decision-makers and other stakeholders 
with conflicting values and competing interests.  
As will be explained in the next section, 
projections of future climate and other important 
variables are uncertain, outcomes are debatable 
and there may be numerous adaptation options 
from which the optimal are to be selected.  
Adaptation decisions are generally evaluated as 
better or worse, not right or wrong.  
For every given climate impact there is a 
spectrum of responses in time, complexity, cost 
and jurisdiction.  For example to deal with 
increasingly frequent and severe extreme rainfall 
events short term responses might range from 
better warnings, increased maintenance of 
storm sewers, reduction of storage levels in 
dams and reservoirs.  Longer-term responses 
might include replacement sewer pipes, re-
routing major arteries, reduction of asphalt and 
concrete surfaces.  Multi- jurisdictional 
responses could involve the construction of 
water diversion channels, dyking, construction of 
dams or reservoirs etc.  As will be discussed 
below, the risk management process will help 
lead planners to the optimal solution or solutions 
as well as assisting in determining the range of 
possible responses.   
In most municipalities, where current issues tend 
to be in the forefront, adapting to an uncertain 
future climate is not a problem that is often 
addressed.  Identifying the best adaptation 
response can seem like an overwhelming 
challenge, and decision-makers may deny or 
defer important actions.  The adaptation issue 
may be addressed by some municipalities as a 
strategic issue as some have done for their 
approach to the environment.  Others will deal 
with the issue pragmatically addressing current 
climate related issues, such as smog-related 

issues, heat issues, waste water concerns or 
emergency management approaches to climate 
change.  Whatever the scope, the process 
described in this Guide will be useful. 
Risk management offers a practicable and 
credible approach for prioritizing complex risk 
issues and for selecting optimal risk reduction 
strategies in order to achieve acceptable levels 
of societal risk.  It also provides a means for 
balancing a range of considerations and for 
using predictive information.   
An abbreviated form of the process can be used 
to make a rapid assessment of a risk issue to 
outline the possible scope and its complexity.  
The process also caters to a large-scale fully 

 

comprehensive assessment which could involve 
a large number of representatives from many 
agencies over a longer period of time.  
Regardless of the scope of the exercise, it is 
important that municipal staffs be familiar with 
the process.  The documentation of the study 
will provide a persuasive business case to 
submit to the decision-maker. 
Most Canadian organizations, including 
municipalities, are familiar with and use risk 
management techniques, either implicitly or 
explicitly.  Managing risks is inherent in the job 
responsibility of most municipal managers.

The Earth’s climate is naturally variable due to a 
number of factors, including the presence of 
naturally occurring greenhouse gases (GHG) in 
the atmosphere. The Intergovernmental Panel 
on Climate Change concluded that, up until the 
mid1960s, the Earth’s warming was attributable 
to both human-caused and natural factors, but 
since about 1970, the Earth’s warming is 
attributed almost exclusively to increased 
atmospheric GHG concentrations from human 
activities.  
Given the current concentrations and the 
persistence of GHGs, and the projected further 
increases in GHG concentrations, it seems 
certain that the climate will continue to change.  
International efforts to reduce GHGs, such as 
the Kyoto Protocol, will only slow the rate of 
change.  Thus, adaptation is an essential 
response to ensure that society is not unduly 
adversely affected by climate change impacts.  
But adaptation to what?  Some people 
mistakenly believe that climate change is simply 
a gradual global warming.  It is increasingly 
evident that other aspects of climate are 
changing, too, especially the frequency and 
intensity of extreme weather events.  These two 
changes, the general warming and the 
increased climate variability, have significant 
implications for many aspects of our sustainable 
livelihoods.

Many social systems are already vulnerable to 
various climate-related and non-climate-related 
risks.  Projected climate changes will exacerbate 
many of these pre-existing vulnerabilities.  
Adaptation measures to reduce these 
vulnerabilities are increasingly urgent. 
Annex 1 contains additional information about 
climate change impacts for Ontario and Canada.   

2.1  Climate trends and projections 

for Ontario 

Over the last 35 years, Ontario’s climate has 
changed in a number of ways.  Some of the 
changes in southern Ontario’s climate are 
presented in Table 1.  It is instructive to compare 
recent climate trends to those projected for the 
coming decades, to consider whether modeled 
projections can reliably inform adaptation 
decision-making.

2.2 

The municipal planning 
context 

Municipal and conservation authority staffs are 
accustomed to dealing with climate-related 
issues in the course of their planning and 
management activities.  For example, they 
manage water supplies, design drainage 
systems and flood protection, design and 
implement heat and smog alert systems, and 
control mosquitoes and other disease vectors.   
But dealing with climate change is new and may 
be unfamiliar. Because it is a relatively new 
subject, the implications of climate change are 
not well understood across departments in many 
municipalities.  As yet, there are few staff 
appointments explicitly responsible for adapting 
to climate change.  Most municipal strategic or 

 

4

long-range plans do not address adaptation to 
climate change.  It can be difficult to get this 
issue on the municipal agenda.   
In Ontario, the provincial government has a 
number of laws and policies which, although 
they may not reference climate change and 
adaptation directly, include strong provisions for 
dealing with risks to municipal infrastructure and 
the health, safety and environmental protection 
of their residents.  This creates a strong and 
justifiable case for adaptation planning in a 
number of key areas.  The same principles apply 
in general to the Conservation Authorities. 
Another prominent problem facing municipalities 
is that, because of pressures on municipal staff, 
it is extremely difficult for them to attend to 
issues that do not have an immediate impact on 
municipal operations.  Sometimes, in order to 
pursue a new initiative, such as a climate 
change risk management initiative, staff of 
municipalities may have to establish that it 
should have a priority over or at least equal to 
an existing responsibility.  This could require a 
 

 

strong business case and a business plan for 
approval by senior management.  This in itself 
may create a work issue for staff.   
Whether the project is a large one, such as 
writing a strategic adaptation plan for the 
municipality or more focussed on particular 
adaptation issues or hazards, it is most 
important that the project has, and continues to 
have throughout its course the support of the 
Municipal Council and the senior administrative 
official and the assignment of adequate 
resources to do the needed work. 
Annex 2 contains more information about 
legislation and policies that will support or 
require climate change adaptation strategies 
and plans for municipalities and conservation 
authorities.  It also provides additional 
information about how to deal with the issues of 
“getting started” and introducing risk 
management and climate change adaptation 
into municipal plans and operations.

3.  Overview of the Risk Management Approach 

 

3.1 
The risk management process 
Risk management is a systematic approach to 
selecting the best course of action in uncertain 
situations by identifying, understanding, acting 
on and communicating risk issues.  In the 
context of adapting to climate change, risk 
management provides a framework for 
developing adaptation strategies in response to 
potential climate changes that create or increase 
risk.  As mentioned above, whether the issue is 
as large as large a municipal strategic plan for 
climate adaptation or a smaller study around 
specific issues such as extreme rainfall events, 
heat, health issues or others, the risk 
management process will Guide staff towards 
the optimal solutions. 
The framework presented in this Guide is based 
on the Canadian standard “Risk Management: 
Guidelines for Decision-makers” (CAN/CSA-
Q850-01).  The decision-making process 
consists of six steps, which are shown in Figure 
1.  The process emphasizes continuous 
communications with stakeholders and good 
documentation of each important action.

 It is a systematic approach for identifying, 
estimating, evaluating, prioritising and 

 

6

implementing risk reduction strategies in order to 
achieve acceptable levels of risk.  Key activities 
include: 

• 

•  Determining the probability and potential 

consequences of events arising from 
situations or hazards; 
Identifying actions that can be taken to avoid 
negative consequences or lessen their 
impact, or to exploit potential benefits; and  
•  Understanding stakeholders’ perceptions of 

probabilities and consequences. 

In practice, information relevant to risk situations 
can be interpreted differently by various groups 
of stakeholders, resulting in quite different 
perceptions of risk.  Given this, the risk 
management process emphasizes the need to 
understand how events might affect or be 
perceived by different stakeholders.   
The completion of each steps leads logically to 
the next, unless the risk issue is resolved, in 
which case the process is terminated.  Steps 
can be repeated to include different 
assumptions, new information or new analyses, 
as appropriate.  The decision options at the end 
of each step are indicated in the “Decision 
Diamond” shown in Figure 2.

options at completion of each step

Next step/ Take 

action 

The process is iterative and can be repeated as 
new information becomes available or new risk 
control options become feasible. 
The process emphasizes continuous 
stakeholder communications and careful 
documentation of all actions taken.  
Communications with all stakeholders, even 
marginal ones, ensures that stakeholders’ 
concerns are considered, and helps build 
support for the eventual results.  Complete 

documentation of each of the major elements of 
the process helps to ensure accountability and 
consistency during implementation.  It provides 
a record for future reference.  This is especially 
important for managing risks from climate 
change.  There are still uncertainties about 
precisely how the climate will change and its 
implications for Ontario communities, so risk 
managers will want to revisit the decision 
process as new information becomes available. 
Depending on the complexity of the risk issue 
being analysed, the process can be completed 
in several days or weeks.  A small risk team 
consisting of two or three people with moderate 
resources can undertake it.  More complex risk 
problems may require a larger team and more 
time.  A useful technique for getting started is to 
complete a simple “first cut” process using 
readily available data and a small risk 
management team.  This will help the team 
explore the issues and possible outcomes 
rapidly and inexpensively.  The results can be 
used to develop a business case for a more 
comprehensive and rigorous project and the 
documentation will have all the necessary logic 
and cost-benefit information to make a 
compelling argument for action. 

3.2  Guiding principles 
The risk management process is built upon 
several important principles:  
 
•  Stakeholder engagement 

Key stakeholders should be identified and 
involved during the entire process.  The 
stakeholder team may be modified 
throughout the process as appropriate to 
particular issues being addressed. 
 

•  Communication 

The risk management team and 
stakeholders should develop an open and 
trustful dialogue that continues throughout 
the decision-making process, in order to: 
(cid:131)  Acquire relevant information; 
(cid:131)  Build public awareness of the particular 

risk and gain support for the process; 

 

(cid:131)  Facilitate consultation; 
(cid:131)  Evaluate stakeholder acceptance of 

risks; and 

(cid:131)  Serve as a part of the monitoring and 

review mechanism. 

In all communication activities it is important 
to remember the languages used by 
stakeholder groups. 
 

•  Promotion of sustainable development  

The outputs of the risk management process 
should be integrated into local development 
planning and should support local 
sustainable development goals. 

 
•  Documentation  

The process should be carefully and 
thoroughly documented and records 
appropriately stored in a “risk information 
library” so that it can easily be retrieved in 
the future.  This will help to: 
(cid:131)  Ensure consistency in execution 
(cid:131)  Promote accountability and 

transparency 

(cid:131)  Develop records for future reference. 

 

•  Use of existing tools, human and 

technical resources  
The risk management team should make 
maximum use of existing resources, such as 
data sets, local knowledge and technical 
expertise, technical methods and previously 
documented experiences.   
 

•  Public Education and Awareness 
Public education and awareness is 
fundamental for successfully implementing 
the risk management process and ensuring 
broad stakeholder support of its results. 
Public education and awareness should 
cover both the potential implications of 
climate change and the risk management 
process itself.

Steps in the Risk Management Process 

What to do and how to do it? 
(1)  Establish the project team and its terms of 
reference, and develop the work plan and 
the key milestones. 
(cid:131)  Select team members with the 

necessary expertise to deal with the risk 
issues being considered.  

(cid:131)  Ensure that there are representatives 

from the organizations that will be 
responsible for implementing the risk 
controls identified at the end of the 
process.  Support and clerical staff may 
be needed to handle the administrative 
and documentation matters.  Others, 
such as members of the legal group 
may be involved at times or review or 
advise on certain aspects of the work. 
(cid:131)  Team members may change over the 

course of the project in order to have the 
expertise needed for each phase of the 
decision process.  

(cid:131)  The team leader should ensure that all 
members of the team know their roles 
and responsibilities with respect to the 
project and are familiar with the risk 
management process. 

(2)  Identify the resources required. 

(cid:131)  Determine the internal capacity that is 

available for the project, including 
available data, tools (e.g. GIS), human 
and financial resources. 
Identify the external resources needed 
and prepare the justification to obtain 
them. 

(cid:131) 

(3)  Assign project team responsibilities, allocate 

resources and set schedules. 

(4)  Identify stakeholders and begin the 

stakeholder analysis 
(cid:131) 

Identify any individuals or groups that 
can affect or may be affected by 
decisions or actions emanating from the 
risk management process. The 
stakeholder group can be quite large. 
(cid:131)  Consider the stakeholders’ interests, 

concerns, rights and likely issues.   
Begin to think about how different 
stakeholders might perceive various risk 
issues differently and how this might 
affect the decision process and

STEP 1: Getting Started 
 
Purpose 
•  This step comprises the initial administrative 

process; 
Identifies the specific problem or hazard and 
the associated risks; 
Identifies the stakeholders and the project 
team especially those with the relevant 
expertise; 

• 

• 

•  Lists the responsibilities of each member of 
the project team and the resources needed 
to complete the risk management 
framework; and   

•  Drafts the workplan and estimates the 

schedule. 

In some cases, there may be reluctance to 
commit busy staff to a risk management 
process.  However, the increasing evidence of 
warming trends, intense smog events, extremely 
heavy rains and floods, is convincing most 
senior managers of the need to include these 
risks in their planning.   
The time required by the team to undertake the 
full process need not be a very long, perhaps a 
concentrated week or several days per week for 
a month or longer depending in part on the 
extent of stakeholder consultations.  However, 
as Step 2 suggests, a quick preliminary run 
through the risk management process is usually 
very helpful in scoping out the issue to see how 
simple or complex it is, determining the 
resources needed and helping to identify who 
should be involved in the team.  If the issue is 
very large and complex a Steering Committee to 
oversee the process supported by sub-groups 
on particular technical aspects may be justified.  
The example at Annex 4 is illustrates the 
scoping approach. 
In either case a dedicated team leader is 
essential from the outset. The team leader is 
usually a municipal planner or a senior member 
of the lead department involved.  It is also very 
important to have and maintain the support of 
the Municipal Council and/or the senior 
administrative official.

Checklist 
Step 1: Getting started 
Have you: 
 

 

 

 

 

communications with the various 
stakeholders.   

(cid:131)  Recognize that the stakeholder group 
may evolve throughout the process.  
(5)  Develop a risk communication plan and 

initiate a dialogue with stakeholders 
(cid:131)  Key questions to consider include: Who 

is responsible for the communication 
process?  Who are the key audiences? 
How will the impact of the 
communications be evaluated? Should 
some on-going, formal structure be 
considered for communicating with 
stakeholders such as a stakeholders’ 
panel? 

(cid:131)  Annex 3 provides additional information 

to help with risk communications. 

(6)  Start the risk information library. 

(cid:131)  The risk information library contains 
copies of all the information collected 
throughout the risk management 
process, including information on the 
risks, data that are used to analyse the 
risks, a record of decisions taken, 
stakeholder views, records of meetings 
and any other information that may be 
obtained during the risk management 
process. 

(cid:131)  Keeping these careful records will 

provide the means to trace the logic 
behind any decisions made.  Also it will 
make it easy for the team to review the

Example: 
EXTREME STORM FOLLOWING A LONG 
HEAT-WAVE: 
Climate estimates for the future indicate that 
there will be more extreme weather events and 
longer spells of very hot weather.  One event 
that could become more frequent is an extreme 
weather event triggered by a week-long heat 
wave and stagnated air mass that could result in 
multiple emergencies including, a large number 
of people suffering from heat stress, extremely 
heavy precipitation resulting in local flooding and 
overtaxed drainage systems, wind damages and 
electrical power outages.  The Municipal Council 
has asked the emergency coordinator whether 
the municipality could cope especially since staff 
of municipal and health agencies are already 
overburdened. 
The overall risk problem is, could the already 
overburdened municipal system effectively and 
efficiently deal with such a scenario and if not 
what would be the likely outcomes?  What 
actions should be recommended to avoid or 
reduce the negative outcomes? 
Actual and potential hazards identified:   
•  Short duration <24 hr. high intensity rains 

more frequent and severe – increasing 
~5%/decade with the largest increases in 
Spring – more erosion and flash floods.   

•  Very high temperatures in the upper 30’s in 

the daytime and, also high at night. 

•  Smog episode with high ozone and 

particulate concentrations. 

•  Possible degradation of water quality.  
•  High possibility of violent thunderstorms and 

strong winds. 

Risk Issues: 
•  Extreme rainfall could cause local flooding, 
washouts, possibly overwhelm the sewage 
treatment plant, surface runoff could 
significantly degrade the quality of water 
intake into the water treatment plant. 

•  Possible electrical power outage. 
•  Additional health problems including 

additional heat stress cases, possible illness 
due to lowered air and water quality would 
have to be handled by the public health 
system that is already under extreme 
pressure. 

•  Potential wind damage. 
Project Team.  The project team would likely be 
headed by a staff member of the emergency 
management group and would include 
representatives of the key affected municipal 
departments such as: public works, public 
health, social services, utilities and 
transportation.  The team could also have 
representatives from other groups such as; an 
elected representative, conservation authority, 
land use planning, environmental planning, 
emergency services (police, fire, ambulance), 
school boards, corporate communications, 
clerical staff and others.  The team leader would 
identify a contact within the municipal 
government for legal advice should that be 
required during the process. 
The team would refresh its understanding of the 
risk management process and ensure that all 
members have appropriate reference material 
about the process. 
Initial Stakeholder Identification and Probable 
Issues Concerns and Needs.   Elderly and very 
young persons with compromised health 
conditions, emergency services, energy sector, 
public works, utilities (including telecom 
providers, electrical suppliers, water and 
wastewater treatment services), roads and 
transportation departments. food distributors, 
social services, NGOs, schools and the 
business sectors. 
Existing Capacity 
•  Staff of five 

 

•  Office space 
• 
IT resources 
Needed Resources 
•  Disseminate information to peers and within 

organization 

•  Newsletter, briefing sessions 
•  Brainstorming sessions 
•  Key stakeholder group briefings and 

question and answer sessions 

•  Corporate communications to develop 

communication strategy and identify means 
to get key messages out. 

Documentation 
This would include for storage in risk information 
library. 

•  Terms of reference for project 
•  List of project team members and 

alternatives, their coordinates and other 
useful information 

•  Lists of hazards and vulnerabilities and 

copies of key documents about them. 

•  Records of any meetings held. 
• 

Initial list of stakeholders including 
contact information and notes on 
probable concerns and issues. 

•  Copies of other documents used or 

created. 

 
DECISION:  GO TO NEXT STEP 
(End of example for Step 1) 
 

STEP 2: Preliminary Analysis 
 
Purpose 
•  To define the climate-related hazard and the 

potential risks that may cause harm, in 
terms of injury, damage to property, the 
environment or monetary losses to the 
community. 

•  To identify possible outcomes from the risk 

situation. 

•  To conduct a quick overview of the process 

to help determine the complexity of the 
project, the probable time-frame for 
completing the work and a sense for 
whether the project team and resources 
assigned are sufficient.

What to do and how to do it? 
(1)  Develop risk scenarios based on the 

hazards and vulnerabilities identified in 
Step 1. 
(cid:131)  Develop scenarios based on a 

sequence of events caused by the 
climate-related hazard that might result 
in adverse effects.   

(cid:131)  Each risk scenarios will be developed or 
expanded to show the types of losses or 
impacts that could occur as a result of 
exposure to the hazard.  Losses could 
include: 
(cid:224)  Health losses due to illness, 
(cid:224)  Injury or death,  
(cid:224)  Property losses,  
(cid:224)  Economic losses and  
(cid:224)  Environmental or ecosystem losses or 

impairment. 

A “fault tree” or “event tree” or similar 
type of analysis mechanism could be 
useful in developing the risk scenarios. 
(cid:131)  The risk scenarios will form the basis for 

more detailed risk estimations and 
evaluations in Steps 3 and 4. 

(2)  Collect data and identify the project baseline 

(cid:131)  Review existing information on current 
vulnerability and climate-related risks, 
based on previous studies and 
experiences and expert opinion.  

(cid:131)  Describe risk controls currently in place 
to manage the specific climate-related 
risks being considered and describe 
their effectiveness and any gaps. 

(cid:131)  Develop a project and risk baseline that 
summarizes the current level of risk with 
respect to recent historical and current 
climate variability.   

(cid:131)  Risks related to climate change will be 

compared later against current or 
baseline risks in order to evaluate the 
need for and benefit of additional risk 
controls. 

(3)  Assign initial estimates of frequency and 

severity to the risk scenarios.  Useful 
information may be found in historical 
records and by consulting with subject 
matter experts to help develop these initial 
estimates. 

 

(4)  Continue the stakeholder analysis 

(cid:131)  Now that there is more information on 
the potential risk issues, identify any 
additional stakeholders that should be 
involved.   

(cid:131)  Refine the analysis of stakeholders’ 

needs, interests and concerns.  

(cid:131)  Engage key stakeholders in the risk 

management process, if you have not 
done so already. 

(cid:131)  Compile a database of all stakeholders 

that includes their contact information 
and the results of your stakeholder 
analysis.  Update the database 
throughout the process. 

(5)  Outline the risk communication plan and 

initiate risk communications with 
stakeholders 

(6)  Update the risk information library: 

(cid:131)  Organize all information collected 
throughout the risk management 
process in a risk information library.  
The library will be the central repository 
for all information, assumptions, 
concerns, decisions and changes made 
throughout the process. 

(cid:131)  The library should include: 

(cid:224)  Baseline data and information on the 

hazards or trends; 

(cid:224)  Roles and responsibilities of the risk 

management team; 

(cid:224)  Identification of decision-makers, and 

scope of decisions to be made; 

(cid:224)  Complete descriptions of the risk 

scenarios; 

(cid:224)  All stakeholder information, including 

minutes of stakeholder meetings or 
other records of stakeholder 
communications; 

(cid:224)  Record of all decisions and 

assumptions 

(cid:131)  Record the source of the information 
and the date it was collected, and any 
weaknesses in the data 
Expected results and outputs 
•  Risk scenarios are developed and a 

preliminary analysis is completed for each, 
showing potential losses 

•  Baseline information has been collected, or 
plans in place to collect additional baseline 
information 

 

11

•  Additional stakeholder analysis completed 
•  Stakeholder communications initiated 
•  Risk information library is started and rules 

for document collection are established;  
Important reference material is documented 
and stored 

• 

•  Outline of risk communications plan has 

been completed. 

Decision 
There are three decision options (see the 
decision diamond in Figure 2 on page 4: End, 
Go back or Next step/Take action.  
•  End the process if the hazard(s) and risk(s) 

are Considered by stakeholders to be 
acceptable. 

•  Go back to Step 1 or the beginning of Step 

2 if the risk management team considers 
that it is necessary to improve on any aspect 
of the information developed in those steps 
or to make any changes, if appropriate.  
Given the nature of the climate change 
issue, it is not unusual to have to improve 
data collection and revisit assumptions in 
order to enhance the credibility of the entire 
risk management process. 
If the risk situation continues to be a 
concern, proceed to the Next Step, Step 3 
Risk Estimation.

Example 
EXTREME WEATHER EVENT DURING A 
LONG HEAT-WAVE (continued from Step 1) As 
discussed in the example in Step 1, Council has 
asked for an opinion as to whether the 
municipality could cope with this type of multiple 
emergency event especially when staff are 

 

already heavily committed because if the long 
heat wave.

Supportive? what are their attitudes? what 
are the special needs of each particular 
group? any who can help? resources?  In 
addition, an analysis should be done of how 
to best contact and engage each 
stakeholder group, develop a database of 
contact information and keep this 
information current.

plans. 
DECISION:  GO TO NEXT STEP

(End of example for Step 2) 

STEP 3: Risk Estimation 
 
Purpose 
•  To identify the frequencies and 

consequences associated with each of the 
risk scenarios1.   
 

What to do and how to do it? 
(1)  Select methods for estimating frequency and 

severity: 
(cid:131)  Consider using historical records to 

determine trends of climate events and 
impacts, technical data and projections 
from the IPCC or from provincial or 
federal governments, and  

(cid:131)  Expert opinions.   

(2)  Estimate the frequency or likelihood of 

possible outcomes** 
(cid:131)  For familiar hazard and risk issues, 

estimates can typically be derived from 
historical data.  Look for data and 
information in research reports, 
insurance company records.  Look also 
at data and information from similar risk 
situations in other regions or countries.   
(cid:131)  Use sensitivity-type analyses, technical 

projections, expert judgment or other 
practicable and credible methods to put 
some boundaries or estimate of 
uncertainty on the projection of the 
frequency of the outcomes. 

(cid:131)  A simple four or five tier comparative 
rating system (such as a scale from 
“occurs very often” to “occurs almost 
never”) is useful for assessing the 
relative frequency of risk scenarios.  For 
climate change assessments, risks 
should be estimated for current 
conditions and say 2020, or for major 
projects, 2050. 

 

                                                      
1 Further information about the technical aspects 
of risk estimation can be found in CSA Standard 
CAN/CSA-Q634.   

 

(3)  Estimate the consequences of possible 

outcomes** 
(cid:131)  Estimate the magnitude of the various 
impacts of a risk situation, in the event 
that the risk scenario occurs.  Use 
measurable, verifiable data wherever 
possible.  Again, look for data and 
information in research reports, 
insurance company records or 
information from similar risk situations in 
other regions or countries.   

(cid:131)  As with frequency estimates, a simple 

comparative impact rating system (such 
as a four or five tier scale from “very 
minor effects” to “extremely serious 
effects”) may be useful for making 
relative estimates of various 
consequences from a particular risk 
scenario.  If extensive loss and other 
impact data are available, explicit values 
could be used in a tabular form so that 
the comparative severity can be 
compared.  At this stage, definitive 
measures are not necessary as this is a 
ranking process to determine which risk 
is the most severe and thus should be 
dealt with first. 

(4)  Assess the stakeholders’ perceptions of risk.  

As explained in more detail in Annex 3, 
stakeholder perceptions of the importance to 
them particularly of the consequences of risk 
scenarios is very important and may have a 
very big influence on the ranking of risks. 
(5)  Display the frequency and consequence 
estimates in a tabular or graphical format 
that clearly indicates the relative importance 
of each scenario.   

 

TABLE 3-1: Frequency / Probability Rating 

(cid:131)  Determine how best to present the 

(cid:131) 

frequency and consequence estimates.  
Consider how stakeholders may 
interpret the estimates.  Table 3-1 
shows one way of displaying frequency 
or probability 
It may be helpful to determine the 
expected value of the loss in each of the 
areas that were selected to categorize 
the expected consequences (for 
example, social, economic and 
environmental aspects).  This may help 
in comparing the losses or 
consequences in each risk scenario and 
provide a baseline for later evaluation of 
risk control measures.  Table 3-2 shows 
one way of displaying these.  The 
headings in this table are generic and 
are not intended to be prescriptive.  
Headings could be selected to describe 
local conditions. 

** It may be useful to repeat these tasks 
several times, each time applying different 
information or assumptions about future 
climate or other factors that might influence 
risk.  The frequency and consequence ratings 
for each scenario will vary depend on the 
planning time horizon (that is whether he plan 
is a short-term plan for the next 2 or 3 years 
or a longer term plan covering 10 or 20 
years).  This requires choosing an appropriate 
time frame for a climate scenario and 
vulnerabilities from which the scenario is 
constructed.

Note: In both tables 3.1 and 3.2 the measurements are expressed in comparative terms (“very 
unlikely” to “virtually certain” and “very low” to “very severe”).  It is also possible to express these in 
numerical values so that adding or multiplying them gives a quantified relative frequency or impact 
consequence.  The problem with using numerical values is that the reader may perceive them to imply 
more accuracy than actually exists.  The risk management team should consider the method to be 
used to compare relative frequency and impact or consequence values and agree on the most 
appropriate way of assigning relative values.  

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(6)  Consult with stakeholders and refine the 

 

 

stakeholder analysis 
(cid:131)  Engage stakeholders in a meaningful 
dialogue in order to communicate the 
risk estimates and to clarify their issues 
and concerns.  Consider using focus 
groups, workshops or public meetings. 
(cid:131)  Communicate information openly and in 

language and detail that stakeholders 
can understand. Provide information on 
the risk baseline (i.e. the risk frequency 
and consequences that exist now), 
methods for developing the risk 
scenarios and for estimating frequencies 
and consequences, assumptions, third 
party analyses and any other relevant 
information. 

(cid:131)  Some stakeholders may not agree with 

the frequency or consequence 
estimates.  Record stakeholders’ 
different views.  Later in the process, 
return to this step, if necessary, to test 
and discuss the sensitivities of the 
proposed adaptation measures to these 
different views of frequency or 
consequences.  

(cid:131)  Stakeholders’ issues and concerns will 
probably change as they become more 
familiar with the risk scenarios and the 
risk management process.  Document 
these changes on an ongoing basis. 

Expected results and outputs 
•  Estimates of frequency and consequences 
of risk scenarios, and estimate of expected 
consequences of each scenario 

•  Frequency and consequence estimates 

presented in a format that is easy-to-
understand by non-experts 

•  Estimates of the acceptance by 

stakeholders of risk, or a record of reasons 
for non-acceptance, based on a dialogue 
with the stakeholders and a careful 
documentation of their perception of the 
risks. 
Decision 
•  End the process if the estimated risks are 
much lower than initially estimated in the 
preliminary analysis, and stakeholders agree 
that there is no longer a significant concern. 

•  Go back if: 

(cid:131)  There is new information that needs to 

(cid:131)  Additional risk scenarios need to be 

be considered; 

considered; 

(cid:131)  There are doubts about data quality or 

analytical methods; or  

(cid:131)  Not all stakeholders are comfortable 

with the level of uncertainty associated 
with the analysis. 

•  Proceed to the next step if the risk 

management team and stakeholders are 

15

comfortable with the data, assumptions and 
outcomes of the risk estimation process.

1.  Trend towards 
greater short duration 
(<24 hr) heavy rains, 
especially in Spring 
and early Summer  
(See Annex 1) 
 

Aspects of Hazards and Risks to Community 

The following hazards and risks from this change in climate 
were identified. 
a)  Greater possibility and frequency of flooding beyond 
previously designated flood plains – exacerbated by 
upstream development in watersheds:  Public/private 
property loss increases, greater threat to life. 
(especially children/elderly) 

b)  Capacity of culverts and storm sewer systems more 

frequently exceeded:  road damage, bridge washouts, 
underpass and basement flooding, increased repair 
bills and insurance costs 

c)  Water pollution incidents from increased erosion, with 

attached pollutants to eroded particles and polluted 
runoff (chemicals, E-coli) as well as pollution from 
storm sewer overflows, into sanitary systems, and 
overflow of hazardous waste sites.  All lead to 
compromise of potable water availability. 

d)  Power and telephone lines downed more frequently 
requiring repair, replacement: reduced social contact 
and business. 

e)  Flooding of work places:  temporary or perhaps 

permanent loss of livelihood. 

f)  Persons displaced to public or private shelters more 

frequently – if public shelters adequate. 

g)  More frequent loss of crops and livestock and greater 

soil losses from erosion in agricultural lands near 
streams. 

h)  More rapid silting of downstream river beds, reservoirs 

i) 

and deltas, compromising fish habitat and reducing 
channel capacity 
Land slides more frequent on unstable slopes with 
insufficient vegetation or protection – identify 
hazardous slopes. 

 

Conservation authorities – near-
flood plain property owners, public 
and private – emergency managers 
– media. 

Transportation department – traffic 
police – public works dept., 
insurance – building owners 
susceptible to sewer backup – 
media  
Municipal water dept. and water 
treatment facilities, drinking water 
and water recreation warnings – 
media – general public 

Electricity and telephone suppliers – 
media – public 

Business recovery planners – 
unemployment insurance managers 
Hotels, B&B’s, etc. – municipal 
building operators. 
Farmers in affected areas 

Conservation authority – municipal 
works departments – fish and 
wildlife associations 
Property owner (private/public) in 
anticipated hazardous lands – 
municipal works and heavy 
equipment operators 
 

2.  More rapid snow 
and ice melt in spring 
combined with 
heavier rains 

As above, but greater threat of ice jams and ponding of 
water upstream of bridges and other obstructions.

Risk Information Library.  Ensure that all the 
data used to develop the estimations of the 
frequency or probability and consequences or 
impacts are recorded and carefully stored in the 
risk information library.  This data may have to 
be reviewed or updated if the steps are repeated 
in the future and the baseline data will be very 
important in this process.  Also, the rating

STEP 4: Risk Evaluation 
 
Purpose 
•  Develop a process for comparing or ranking 

each risk scenario. 

•  Evaluate the risks by examining them in 
terms of costs, benefits and acceptability, 
considering the needs, issues and concerns 
of stakeholders. 
Identify unacceptable risks and prioritize 
them for risk reduction or control strategies. 

• 

What to do and how to do it? 
To this point in the process, only the hazards 
and risks have been analyzed.  Now the 
operational aspects and costs and benefits that 
accrue in each scenario will be considered.   
 
The  indirect  costs  and  benefits  can  be  extensive,  so  it  is 
 
important to have the relevant expertise to assess them available 
 
to the risk management team.  An example would be the impact 
 
of reduced water availability to a golf course.  Water prices might 
 
rise, making irrigation prohibitively costly.  In the short term, the 
 
golf  course  might  lose  patronage  and  suffer  a  financial  impact.  
Workers  might  lose  jobs.    In  the  longer  term,  the  golf  course 
 
might  have  to  close,  and  the  land  could  be  converted  into 
 
parkland  or  residential  housing.  Any  of  these  outcomes  has 
 
associated economic and social costs and benefits

values assigned in these charts should be 
carefully annotated and stored for future 
reference.   
Ensure also that the stakeholder analysis and 
data bank is updated. 
 
DECISION:  GO TO NEXT STEP 
(End of example for Step 3)
 
(1)  Develop the costs and benefits of each risk 
scenario including not only the direct costs 
and benefits but also the important indirect 
ones. 

 (2) Analyze risk perceptions of key 

stakeholders, including those representing 
the general public. 

(3)  Assess the acceptability of risks associated 

with the risk scenarios and potential 
outcomes. 

(4)  Compare the risks using appropriate criteria 

such as a summary of the consequence 
data from the previous step assessing the 
important social, economic and 
environmental consequences using a 
convenient scale ranging from very low to 
extreme along with the frequency or 
probability estimates.   
(cid:131)  Consider using a “risk evaluation matrix” 
to assist in comparing or prioritizing the 
various risks.  Combine the frequency 
and consequence ratings for each risk 
as determined in Step 3 into a single 
matrix.  Establish acceptability values 
against which the various risks can be 
compared.  The chart below is an 
example for such a display. This chart 
uses qualitative measures such as 
“low”, “moderate”, “major”.  Other 

 

measures such as numerical values 
may be used so long as they do not 
imply an accuracy that is not implicit in 
the comparative values.    

(cid:131)  Because experts and non-experts 
generally view risks differently, it is 
important to maintain an open and 
interactive dialogue with stakeholders in 
order to accurately gauge their level of 
acceptance of risks.

(5)  During the dialogue with stakeholders about 
their perceptions and the acceptability of the 
risks, begin to identify plausible risk control 
options to help reduce unacceptable risks to 

 

19

acceptable levels.  These will be considered 
in the next step. 

(6)  Update the risk information library  
Expected results and outputs 
•  Risks evaluated in terms of probability, 

consequence, costs and benefits. 

•  Risks prioritized. 
•  Unacceptable risks identified. 
•  Meaningful dialogue with stakeholders about 

acceptability of risks. 

•  Risk information library updated. 
Decision 
•  End the process if: 

(cid:131)  Stakeholders agree that the risks are 

acceptable; or  

(cid:131)  The risk is completely unacceptable 

cannot be reasonably dealt with, and all 
stakeholders agree that the process 
should be ended.  This would only 
happen if the risk or activity generating it 
was not mandatory or inevitable. 

•  Go back if: 

(cid:131)  There is insufficient data or information 

to make a decision; 

(cid:131)  Stakeholders were not adequately 

consulted; 

(cid:131)  Not all key stakeholders agree with the 

conclusions; or  

(cid:131)  There is new information that might 
materially change the frequency or 
consequence estimates. 

•  Proceed to the Next Step if stakeholders 
agree that the risks are unacceptable and 
that risk control measures will have to be 
implemented

Example

AREAS AND RELATED SOURCE WATER 
QUALITY PROTECTION (example continued 
from Step 3) 
Data and information needs for estimation.  Key 
needs are: 
•  Current flood plain maps and period of data 

upon which they were based and culverts 
design size 

•  Designated hazardous lands 
•  Changes in heavy rain frequency and 

severity to date and projected for 3 to 4 
decades (see Annex 1 for estimates) 

•  Determination of frequency of threshold rain 

intensities for producing peak floods and 
overflows, now and projected for 4 decades 
•  Review very recent 2003 to 2006 incidents 
of extreme rainfalls in southern Ontario and 
assess ability of water treatment facility to 
cope with greater suspended sediment and 
accompanying chemical and pathogen 
pollution. 

•  Obtain weather radar date to augment 

station rainfall date (from Meteorological 
Service Canada) 

•  Determine seasonality of changes in intense 

• 

rains 
Inventory of properties at risk and values 
now and within 4 decades and projected 
economic losses and numbers of people 
displaced 

•  Determine current rates of siltation and 

project to future 

•  Assess frequency and severity in past 

decade of degraded water quality due to 
flood flows, and projected for 4 decades 
•  Estimates of costs to extend flood plain 

designations, and increase culvert sizes and 
storm drainage capacities 

This information when collected and analyzed 
would determine frequency and severity of 
events. 
Based on information available to team and 
trends of frequency and intensity, the following 
Risk Evaluation table was developed as shown 
below (note:  See the frequency and 
consequence tables in the example in the 
previous step.  Only the flooding beyond the 
designated floodplains and the exceeding 
culvert and drainage system risks were 
illustrated there.  For this example the remainder 

 

20

of the risks were also included to illustrate how 
the risks could be ranked.) 
These ratings combine the completed tables 3-1 
and 3-2 in the previous section on step 3.  
Consequences assessment or “severity of 
impacts” was based upon a subjective review of 
the Social, Economic and Environmental 
Factors, discussed in Step 2.  It is considered 
that additional loss of life is unlikely unless 
systems in place fail. (e.g. Walkerton water 
supplies or flood warnings) 
Decision 
A dialogue with stakeholders, after completing 
these analyses was considered to be needed 
before moving to Step 5 – Risk Controls and 
Adaptative Decisions.  However some cost 
effective potentially “win-win” adaptation 
measures could be suggested with present 
information. 
These include: 
1.  Update flood-plain mapping 
2.  Ensure fail-safe potable water treatment and 

improve water quality advisories 

3.  Strengthen flood warning systems 
4.  Revise design standards for new drainage 

and storm management facilities 

5.  Re-visit operation plans for upstream dams 
6.  Put in place water intake and well-head 
protection measures for water supplies 
Improve public and stakeholder education 
programs. 

7. 

The team reviewed the check-list for Step 4 and 
concluded: 
1.  They were not satisfied that they had all of 

the data needed for identifying potential 
adaptation measures. 

2.  With available data, levels of frequency and 

consequences could only be roughly 
estimated. 

3.  Levels of risk have been identified 
qualitatively but not quantitatively. 

4.  Stakeholder consultations were not done 

and are urgent. 

5.  Relevant available information was 

recorded.

STEP 5: Risk Controls and 
Adaptation Decisions 
 
Purpose 
In the previous step, the risks were evaluated 
and ranked, and a dialogue was held with key 
stakeholders about the acceptability of the risks.  
For unacceptable risks, some consideration was 
given about potential risk control or adaptation 
measure being introduced to bring risks down to 
acceptable levels.  In this step:  
•  Feasible strategies will be identified for 

reducing unacceptable risks to acceptable 
levels. 

 
 

 

 

21

 
 
•  The effectiveness of the adaptation or risk 

control strategies will be evaluated including 
the costs, benefits and risks associated with 
the proposed adaptation measures. 

•  Optimal adaptation or risk control strategies 

will be selected and consideration will be 
given to the acceptability of residual risks. 

What to do and how to do it? 
(1)  Identify feasible adaptation or risk control 

options: 
(cid:131) 

Identify the full complement of potential 
adaptation responses that could reduce 
the frequency or the consequences of 
the risks.  Consider the different types of 
adaptations discussed in the box below

 

Anticipatory or proactive adaptation: adaptations implemented before a climate change impact, in order to reduce or prevent 
an adverse effect.  
Reactive adaptation: adaptations implemented post a climate change impact, in order to reduce its adverse effect. 
Note: Since initial impacts of climate change may have already been observed in some sectors but more severe impacts are 
anticipated in future, many adaptations may be thought of as a combination of reactive and anticipatory. 
Private adaptation: adaptations that are initiated and implemented by individuals, households or private companies.  Private 
adaptation is usually in the actor’s rational self-interest. 
Public adaptation: adaptations that are initiated and implemented by governments.  Public adaptation is usually directed at 
collective needs.  
Autonomous or spontaneous adaptation: Adaptation that does not constitute a conscious response to climatic stimuli but is 
triggered in ecological changes in natural systems and by market or welfare changes in human systems.   
Planned adaptation: Adaptations that are the result of deliberate policy decision, based on an awareness that conditions have 
changed or are about to change, and that actions are required to return to, maintain, or achieve a desired state. 
 
 

(cid:131)  Typically, an adaptation or risk reduction 

strategy will comprise a portfolio of 
measures.  Together, these measures 
should offer a cost-effective means for 
reducing unacceptable risks to 
acceptable levels. 

(2)  Evaluate the adaptation or risk control 
options in terms of effectiveness, cost, 
residual risks and stakeholder acceptance. 
(cid:131)  Estimate the effectiveness of the 

(cid:131) 

proposed options using historical data 
and professional judgement.    
Identify and assess residual risk 
scenarios generated by the control 
option, which may result in other 
beneficial to adverse effects.  

(cid:131)  Communicate with stakeholders on 
potential control options in order to 
gauge their acceptance of risk controls 
and perceptions of residual risks. 
(cid:131)  Evaluate the risk control options in 

terms of: 
(cid:224)  Effectiveness in reducing losses or 
impacts or changing probabilities. 

(cid:224)  Implementation costs. 
(cid:224)  The needs, issues and concerns of 

affected stakeholders 

(cid:224)  The impact on other stakeholder 

interests. 

(3)  Develop the implementation plan for the 

adaptation or risk control measures: 
(cid:131)  Select the complement of adaptation or 
risk control options that will ensure that 
risks are reduced to acceptable levels in 
ways that optimize cost, efficiency, 
stakeholder and other considerations. 

 
 

 

22

 
 
(cid:131)  Consider structural measures such as , 
better roads or water systems and non-
structural measures such as public 
warning systems business continuity 
plans, land use planning measures and 
public education and awareness. 
(cid:131)  Determine the costs and benefits 

associated with the adaptation plan. 

(cid:131)  Determine how to finance the 

implementation and begin to try to 
secure financing. 

(cid:131)  Some criteria that could be useful in 
making these decisions are shown in 
the box below: 

(4)  Develop a risk communications plan related 

to residual risks 
(cid:131) 

In some instances, it may be prudent for 
municipalities to encourage private 
adaptations to further reduce residual 
risks.  For example, municipalities can 
encourage residents to keep valuables 
out of basements that may flood during 
a heavy precipitation event or use public 
transit to reduce smog.  The municipality 
can influence total losses from these 
types of events and also limit its own 
liability exposure. 

(5)  Update the risk information library 
Expected results and outputs 
•  Feasible risk control options identified 
•  Adaptation plan completed based on priority 

risks/hazards identified in earlier steps. 

•  Strategies for financing implementation of 

adaptation measures  

•  Risks and residual risks accepted by 

stakeholders.  

 

•  Risk information library updated. 
Decision 
•  End if there are no feasible adaptation 

options. 

•  Go back if: 

(cid:131)  Adequate data are not available for 
evaluating the cost-effectiveness of 
potential risk controls. 

(cid:131)  Key stakeholders have not been 

consulted. 

(cid:131)  Assumptions and uncertainties 

associated with estimates are not 
acceptable to stakeholders, or 

(cid:131)  New risks will be introduced if the 

proposed control options are 
implemented. 

•  Proceed to the Next Step if: 

(cid:131)  Feasible adaptation or risk control 

options are defined and can be 
implemented. 

(cid:131)  Proposed actions are feasible from a 

cost and effectiveness perspective and 
are acceptable to stakeholders, and 

(cid:131)  Residual risks are acceptable to 

stakeholders. 

Checklist 
Adaptation and risk control 
Have you: 
 

1. 

Identified and evaluated feasible adaptation 
or risk control options, in terms of costs, 
effectiveness, stakeholder acceptance and 
other criteria? 

2.  Selected the complement of adaptation or 
risk control options that best reduce risks to 
acceptable levels? 

3.  Determined the costs and benefits of the risk 
control measures, and a means for financing 
them? 

4.  Assessed and addressed any outstanding 

stakeholder concerns? 

 

 

 

 

 

5.  Developed a risk communication plan for the 

proposed adaptation or risk control 
measures and for the residual risks? 

6.  Ensured that the risk information library is 

updated? 

 
Example  
(This example was developed based on a health 
risk related to worsening urban smog.) 

 

23

The risk management team concluded that the 
health risks are unacceptable from the combined 
effects of warmer summers, especially night-
time temperatures that are rising more rapidly 
than day-time highs, thus providing little relief to 
sufferers in heat waves and increasingly 
frequent smog events.  
The team identified many feasible adaptation 
measures or risk control options that could be 
implemented in the near-term and over the 
longer-term. The team evaluated the options 
and recommended the following portfolio of 
controls for implementation: 
Immediate: 
•  Policy measures (e.g. incentives to promote 

public transit and reduce vehicle use) and 
operational changes (e.g. cancel non-
essential municipal operations) to help 
reduce the severity of smog events;   

•  Public education and outreach to ensure 

that vulnerable populations are informed of 
the health risks and appropriate responses; 
and 

•  Ensure that hospitals and clinics are 

equipped to cope with large admission 
events.   

•  Business continuity plans for key municipal 

organizations are important adaptation 
measures in this situation. 

Over a longer period: 
•  Plan new land uses and developments to 
promote the “compact urban form” and the 
use of public transit;  

•  Retrofit programs for public transportation 

systems; 

•  Develop short-term emission limitation 

actions; and  

•  Advocate for stronger responses to urban air 
pollution and greenhouse gas emissions by 
higher levels of government and 
international agreements. 

The team concluded that these responses 
balanced the need to reduce the frequency or 
severity of the events, but also to limit the health 
effects from events that do occur.  The near-
term measures were determined to be low-cost, 
voluntary and publicly acceptable measures that 
will result in an immediate reduction in health 
impacts and health care costs.  The land-use 
and development planning recommendation is in 

 

line with the requirements established by the 
Provincial Policy Statement of Ontario, (2005).   
The risk management team thought that the 
advocacy role was especially important for the 
municipality.  Because much of the precursors to 
smog originate from outside of the municipality, 
regional and international air emission 
reductions can significantly improve local air 
quality. Also, the team thought that by assuming 
a strong advocacy role, the municipality would 
build credibility among its residents and be more 
successful in implementing the other measures.  
The team did not identify any risk financing 
issues.  However, there are major direct costs 
associated with health effects, but these are 
reflected in health care costs and budgets which 
were not included in the analysis.   
The team was unable to quantify the residual 
risk with precision.  They recommended that the 
municipality implement the options identified 
above, monitor the effects of these measures, 
and revisit the risk management process in two 
years to decide if additional risk control 
measures are required. 
(End of example for Step 5) 

STEP 6: Implementation and 
Monitoring 
 
Purpose 
•  To develop and implement the adaptation 

plan. 

•  To monitor and evaluate the effectiveness 

and costs of the adaptation responses. 

•  To decide to continue or terminate the risk 

management process. 

What to do and how to do it? 
(1)  Develop the implementation plan 

(cid:131)  Develop implementation plans including 
priorities for action for each adaptation 
measure.   

(cid:131)  Plans should be linked to existing 

municipal programs, where appropriate. 
Review any relevant non-climate-related 
social, economic or environmental 
action plans, and consider linking the 
risk control efforts as closely to these as 
possible.  For example, there may be a 

 

24

program to strengthen existing initiatives 
to protect public health in smog 
episodes.  Your risk control or 
adaptation measures could be linked to 
this program. 

(cid:131)  Decide the timing for the implementation 
of adaptation or risk control measures.  
Some risk issues may not surface for 
years, or it may not be feasible to 
address them immediately.  In these 
cases, it may be prudent to defer 
implementation of some components 
until a future date.  

(cid:131)  Establish a review date and record it in 

the risk information library. 

(cid:131)  Before submitting the implementation 
plan for approval, review any similar 
climate change risk management 
initiatives, for example, from 
neighbouring municipalities, and 
compare your results to theirs. 

(cid:131)  Look for opportunities to collaborate 

across boundaries.  Unfortunately, 
climate change impacts will not be 
related to political boundaries, but 
adaptation responses will.  Exploit any 
collaborative potential to improve the 
effectiveness of adaptation responses.

Example 
This is the final result of the risk problem in the 
example in Step 1 and Step 2: could an already 
overburdened municipal system effectively and 
efficiently deal with an extreme weather event 
triggered by a week-long heat wave and 
stagnant air that could result in multiple 
emergencies and if not what would be the likely 
outcomes? 
The strategy was to develop a Feasible 
Implementation Plan. Include a HIRA (hazard 
identification and risk assessment) for each risk 
in the risk scenario.  The implementation plan 
focuses on taking the cheapest, fastest actions 
that could significantly reduce the strain on 
municipal services and lessen the impacts on 
the community. 
The plan identifies synergies with on-going 
municipal activities.  Infrastructure development 
programs and programs offering special 
financial assistance from senior governments 
were selected. 
The plan with support from key stakeholders 
was submitted for approval.  When approved 
resources will be in-place for the Implementation 
Plan.  The plan also contains effective 
measurement and monitoring activities to verify 
whether the objectives are being achieved.  
Stakeholder groups, or peer reviewers, to 
ensure independence and validity of information, 
can conduct monitoring. 

Conduct a focus group or brainstorm session 
with key stakeholders to identify everything that 
is needed in the documentation library, including 
knowledge transfer, financial resources and 
authorities. 
Finally, the plan contains an effective 
communication strategy for program support.  

 

This should include communication about the 
residual risks.  Target audiences have been 
identified and information and other supporting 
materials (such as t-shirts, brochures etc.) have 
been specified.

Annex 1: Summary of Climate Change Impacts in Ontario and Canada 
 
Many factors have influenced major changes in 
the climate system over the centuries.  The 
natural ones include changes in the earth’s orbit 
and its albedo (or reflectivity), changes in the 
sun’s energy, and in volcanic emissions from 
which suspended particles cause cooling 
episodes.   
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change reviewed many research papers which 
examined the relative importance of these 
natural climate forcing factors, relative to forcing 
by the rising greenhouse gas concentrations 
driven by human activities.  
Fluctuations in global mean temperatures 
responded mainly to the natural factors up until 
about 1950.  From 1970 on, the rapidly rising 
global mean temperatures can only be explained 
by the increasing greenhouse gas 
concentrations.  Greenhouse gases will also 
dominate future climate trends, so trends from 
1970 can be considered to be a good indicator 
of climatic trends for the coming decades.  
(IPCC 2001) 
Carbon dioxide, CO2 is the most important 
greenhouse gas and once emitted stays in the 
climate system for a century or more, and 
becomes well mixed in the atmosphere, no 
matter where it is emitted.  Pre-industrial 
concentrations were about 280 ppmv.  The 
levels in the atmosphere in 2005, are at 380 
ppmv, and if emissions continue on a “Business 
as Usual” course, will be about 740 ppmv or 
moving towards 3 times pre-industrial 
concentrations by late in this century.  In worst 
case scenarios, we could reach 1000 ppmv, and 
in the best case, with effective global emission 
controls, this century would end at 560 ppmv, or 
double pre-industrial concentrations by 2100.  
Most studies of impacts are based on a CO2 
doubling, a very hopeful scenario.  The difficulty 
in turning around our fossil fuel based 
economies means that it will be necessary to 
adapt to significant climate change in coming 
decades – as well as reduce emissions as much 
as possible. 
Projections of future climate are made by Global 
Climate Models which model mathematically, 
the interactions between the atmosphere and 

oceans, and between the air and land surfaces.  
Their projections take into account both the 
warming effects of the greenhouse gases, and 
the much smaller cooling due to increases in 
sulphate aerosols from industrial emissions.   
Table 1 gives information on the changes 
affecting Canada observed to the end of 2000, 
and the projected changes into the present 
century.  The latter are based mainly on the 
outputs of the Canadian Global Climate Model – 
an Atmosphere-Oceans General Circulation 
Model.  This model has predicted reasonably 
well the changes that have occurred in Canada 
to date. (Boer et al. 1998)  In these model 
outputs, it is assumed that atmospheric 
greenhouse gas concentrations will continue to 
increase at recent or slightly increased rates, 
due to continued global increases in emissions 
primarily from burning of fossil fuels.  In a few 
cases in Table 1, the consensus projections of 
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
2001 Report are cited instead of Canadian 
model outputs. 
SOUTHERN ONTARIO AND GREAT LAKES-
ST. LAWRENCE BASIN 
In this industrialized and heavily populated 
region, mean temperatures to date have risen by 
about 0.60C and are expected to continue to rise 
by another 2-30C by 2050.  Models give 
conflicting signals as to whether annual 
precipitation will increase slightly or decline, so a 
hypothesis of little future change in total might 
be assumed, but with more of the precipitation in 
rain and less in snow.  Under most models, 
evaporation losses are expected to more than 
offset any changes in precipitation.  Water 
issues, including levels of the Great Lakes and 
pollution problems are major climate change 
concerns, but health issues with more prolonged 
neat waves and smog episodes in and near 
urban areas, flash floods and drainage design, 
agriculture, and recreational impacts are also of 
significant concern. 
Great Lakes – St. Lawrence System: 
The extent of impacts on Great Lakes levels and 
flows of a changing climate remains a subject of 
some disagreement among scientists.  While 

 

27

 

most models suggest increasing evaporation 
losses especially from the large Upper Lakes 
(Superior-Huron-Michigan) and little precipitation 
change, at least one (Hadley Centre 2) 2 
suggests considerably more precipitation over 
the basin (although the Hadley Centre 3 model 
results are drier and close to other model 
outcomes).  Thus, the majority of models 
indicate a significant lowering of lake levels 
(Mortsch et al., 2000).  For the Canadian model, 
these declines would be by 2050, 0.3m for Lake 
Superior, 1m for Huron, 0.8m for Erie and 0.5m 
for Ontario.  These declines would result in a 
loss of 1.3m water depth in Montreal Harbour on 
the St. Lawrence.  A drop in Harbour water 
levels of only 30cm in the 1988-91 period 
resulted in a 15% reduction in tonnage handled.  
Recently experienced falls in lake levels (except 
on Lake Ontario), but with levels still slightly 
above long term record lows, indicate the 
concerns that continuing lower levels and flows 
would bring.  Commercial shipping would be 
hampered not only in Montreal harbour.  For a 
2.5cm lowering of Lakes Michigan-Huron a 
cargo ship must reduce loads by 90 to 115 
tonnes worth some $25,000US per trip.  
Hydropower production at Niagara and on the 
St. Lawrence would be reduced, losses were 
19% and 26% of production respectively in the 
1960s low water period.  Dredging of channels 
would be costly and would stir up contaminated 
sediments.  On the other hand, shore property 
owners would inherit more land – e.g. a 1.6m 
water level decline on shallow Lake St. Clair 
would displace the shoreline by 1 to 6 km. 
(Mortsch et al. 2000, Mortsch 1998). 
Groundwater and Tributary Water Supplies: 
With warmer summers, both water demand from 
groundwater and tributary rivers to the Great 
Lakes system, like the Grand and Ottawa, are 
increasing for both consumptive and recreational 
uses.  Trends to date in streamflow and water 
levels have been mixed with some streams 
showing declines in low flows and others, small 
increases.  Groundwater provides 50% of Great 
Lakes tributary streamflow in Ontario, and 90% 
of rural residents use ground water for domestic 
purposes.  Projections to 2050 with the 
Canadian GCM output suggest a 19% drop in

and well endowed to become one of the world’s 
leading climate change modelling and climate 
studies institutes.

groundwater levels and their contribution of base 
flow or minimum flows to streams. (Piggott 
2005). 
More Intense Rains: 
There is increasing evidence of increases in 
heavier short duration (24 hour or less) rain 
events in southern Ontario, since 1970 
(Adamowski 2003, Stone 2001). The Canadian 
climate model, and other models, have been 
used to project future trends in high intensity 
rains. (Kharin and Zweirs 2000)  Table 2 
summarizes the average trends in the amount of 
the annual maximum rain events. This suggests 
that the approximately 5% per decade increase 
in 24 hour amounts observed over the past three 
decades may continue in future decades. 
Recent extreme rain intensities in North Toronto 
19 August 2005, Peterborough, July 2004, and 
northern Grand River basin June 13-14, 2004, 
suggest there may be even more rapid trends 
towards increasing magnitude of heavy rain 
events in isolated storms. 
Such high intensity events have important 
implication for drainage design, storm water 
management systems, soil erosion and polluted 
runoff from croplands and animal wastes. The 
Soil and Water Conservation Society (2003), 
has used data from runoff plots and small 
watersheds, with a range of soil types, slopes 
and vegetation, to estimate impacts on erosion 
rates and runoff of increases in rain intensities. 
To illustrate a 10% increase in rain due to 
intensity changes resulted in an average 24% 
increase in erosion and 25% increase in runoff.   
Urban Air Pollution: 
Smog episodes will be longer and more intense 
in this region.  An estimated 1900 premature 
deaths and many hospital emissions per year 
occur at present in Ontario from smog and air 
pollution. More intense and prolonged heat 
waves in future will make this an even more 
serious public health issue, when both air 
pollution and high heat stress affect vulnerable 
populations of asthmatics and the elderly.  
Remedial actions are urgent. These can be 
approached by various adaptation measures.  In 
addition, by reducing dependency on fossil fuels, 
both local air pollutants and contributions to 
greenhouse gas forcing of climate can be 
reduced at the same time. 

 

Recreation: 
Winter snow-based recreation in southwest 
Ontario will have shorter seasons in future, 
due to less ice on the lakes.  A longer summer 
recreation season is expected. 
Winter storms and disasters: 
More intense winter snow and ice storms in the 
Northern Hemisphere are projected by climate 
models (Lambert 1995) and evidence of trends 
in this direction have been documented 

 

although snow amounts could increase at ski 
resorts to the east of Lake Huron and Georgian 
Bay with a longer period of lake-effect storms 
(McCabe et al. 2001). Public Safety and 
Emergency Preparedness Canada has 
documented an approximate 7-fold increase in 
numbers of climate/weather related disasters 
between the 1960s and the 1990s, while the 
number of geophysical disasters remained 
steady.

Annex 2:  Introducing Adaptation to Climate Change to Local 
Authorities 
 
1.  The municipal institutional 

context 

Municipal and conservation authority staffs are 
accustomed to dealing with climate-related 
issues in the course of their planning and 
management activities.  For example, they 
manage water supplies, design drainage 
systems and flood protection, design and 
implement heat and smog alert systems, and 
control mosquitoes and other disease vectors.   
But dealing with climate change is new and may 
be unfamiliar. Because it is a relatively new 
subject, the implications of climate change are 
not well understood across departments in many 
municipalities.  As yet, there are few staff 
appointments explicitly responsible for adapting 
to climate change.  Most municipal strategic or 
long-range plans do not address adaptation to 
climate change and it can be difficult to get it on 
the municipal agenda.   
In Ontario the provincial government has 
provided and a number of laws and policies 
which, although they may not reference climate 
change and adaptation directly, make strong 
provisions for dealing with risks to municipal 
infrastructure and the health, safety and 
environmental protection of their residents to 
create a strong and justifiable case for 
adaptation planning in a number of key areas.  
The same principles apply in general to the 
Conservation Authorities. 
Similarly the “duty of care” incumbent upon 
municipalities could add weight to the argument 
that a municipality might be held liable for failing 
to consider the implications of climate change 
where such failure could increase the risk to its 
citizens.   
Another prominent problem facing municipalities 
is that it is extremely difficult to attend to issues 
that do not have an immediate impact on 
municipal operations.  Sometimes, in order to 
pursue a new initiative, such as a climate 
change risk management initiative, municipal 
staff have to establish that it should have a 
priority over or at least equal to an existing 
responsibility.  This would require a strong 
business case and a business plan for approval 

 

31

by senior management.  This in itself may create 
a work issue for staff.   
2.  Policy and operational 

responsibilities 

In Ontario there is however a strong policy 
foundation to manage risks associated with 
climate change: 
•  The Ontario Municipal Act (2001) assigns 

broad authority and accountability to 
municipalities in ten spheres of local 
jurisdiction, including four that are directly 
affected by and related to climate change:   
(cid:131)  Public utilities, 
(cid:131)  Culture, parks, recreation and heritage, 
(cid:131)  Structures, and 
(cid:131)  Economic development services.   
•  The Provincial Policy Statement (2005) 

provides the policy foundation for 
development that supports and integrates 
the principles of strong communities, a clean 
and healthy environment and economic 
growth.  The statements quoted below 
provide a strong rationale for incorporating 
climate change adaptation strategies into 
long-term or strategic development plans 
related to them: 
(cid:131) 

“A coordinated, integrated and 
comprehensive approach should be 
used when dealing with planning 
matters within municipalities…” (p. 7) 
“Planning for sewage and water 
services shall…ensure that these 
systems are provided in a manner that 
1) can be sustained by the water 
resources upon which such services 
rely; … and 3) protects human health 
and the natural environment.” (p. 10) 
“Long-term economic prosperity should 
be supported by … planning so that 
major facilities and sensitive land uses 
are appropriately designed…to prevent 
adverse effects…and to minimize risk to 
public health and safety.” (p. 13) 
“Planning authorities shall support … 
improved air quality through land use 
and development patterns which 

(cid:131) 

(cid:131) 

(cid:131) 

 

promote compact urban form and the 
use of public transit; focus travel-
intensive land uses on sites which are 
well served by public transit or design 
these to facilitate the establishment of 
public transit in the future; improve the 
mix of employment and housing uses to 
shorten commute journeys; …” (p.14) 
“Planning authorities shall protect, 
improve or restore the quality and 
quantity of water by minimizing potential 
negative impacts, including cross-
jurisdictional impacts; … and ensuring 
storm water management practices that 
minimize storm water volumes and 
contaminant loads …:” (p. 16) 
“Development shall be directed away 
from areas of natural or human-made 
hazards where there is an unacceptable 
risk to public health or safety or of 
property damage.” (p.22) 

(cid:131) 

(cid:131) 

•  The Emergency Management Act (2003) 

requires all Ontario municipalities to develop 
comprehensive, risk-based emergency 
management programs based on 
prevention, preparedness, response and 
recovery.  Municipalities are required to 
establish their “enhanced”-level program 
which identifies specific areas that would 
have to include the vulnerabilities to climate 
change: 
(cid:131)  Development of a Hazard Analysis and 

Risk Assessment (HIRA) analysis of 
their municipality 

(cid:131)  Development of a prevention/mitigation 

strategy for identified high risks; 
(cid:131)  Publication of a recovery plan for 

identified high risks; 

(cid:131)  Development of a response strategy for 

identified hazards; 
Implementation of guidelines for risk-
based land use planning; and  
Implementation of a detailed risk-based 
public education program 

(cid:131) 

(cid:131) 

•  Under the Conservation Authorities Act  
None of these policies or operational 
requirements explicitly prescribe the authority to 
pursue adaptation to climate change, but they 
certainly demand consideration of climate 
change as it relates to these specific aspects of 
municipal administration.  In fact, it would be 
difficult to satisfy these requirements without 

 

32

accounting for possible climatic changes.  
Adaptation, then, is emerging as a critical 
dimension of existing municipal functions.   
Conservation Authorities are responsible for 
flood plain mapping, flood warning systems, 
source water protection, including reducing 
erosion and runoff from vulnerable lands. 
In Canada, municipalities can be held liable in 
negligence for “operational” decisions, but not 
for “policy” decisions.  Where a municipality has 
a duty of care to its citizens it might be held 
liable for failing to consider the implications of 
climate change.  For example, in planning for 
sewage and water services so that the systems 
protect human health and the natural 
environment a municipality might be considered 
negligent if it failed to consider increasing rain 
intensities and frequency that could overwhelm 
sewage services creating unacceptable risks to 
human health and the environment.  As more 
and more municipalities include the implications 
of climate change in their plans and operations, 
the precedent will be more firmly established. 
 
3.  Internal policies and 

administration  

Municipalities conduct their business within a 
hierarchy of official plans and related plans (e.g. 
environmental strategic plan, growth 
management plan, etc.), all of which are 
referenced to each other.  It is within this context 
that municipal functions are institutionalized and 
may arise when local emergencies escalate into 
regional emergencies sustained over time.  
Given the uncertainties related to climate 
change and its implications for municipalities, a 
one-time risk management initiative is nearly 
certain not to produce “successful adaptation to 
climate change”.  Over time, municipalities will 
need to stay abreast of new knowledge about 
the changing climate and account for it in their 
infrastructure developments, storm water 
management policies, public education activities 
and other relevant management activities.  
Thus, to be most successful, “climate change 
risk management” needs to be institutionalized 
into municipal decision-making, via inclusion in 
the official plan or related plans. 
Like many organizations, municipalities are 
typically structured in functional departments 
which tend to spawn “silos” of activity.  Silos can 
significantly hinder adaptation to climate change.  

 

In general, there are relatively few staff in any 
given municipality that are well-versed on the 
climate change issue, so it can be difficult to 
mobilize and maintain support for an adaptation 
initiative.  Workshop participants emphasized 
the importance of engaging and educating 
council, staff and the general public, and of 
demonstrating the links between adaptation and 
existing responsibilities. 
A risk management process should generally be 
initiated (and subsequently delivered) through 
existing interdepartmental networks.  Staff could 
look to external partners, such as their 
conservation authority partner or a local non-
governmental organization, to help compile the 
information required for a winning business plan 
and establish the initiative as a legitimate 
priority.  Staff might also refer to information 
from this Guide, especially from Annex I which 
summarizes observed and projected climate 
changes and risk issues for Ontario, as they 
prepare a business plan.  The business plan 
should link risk issues to established corporate 
goals, community values, significant aspects 
identified in a municipality’s Environmental 
Management System (if there is one) and any 
other plans or established priorities.  
Environmental psychologists have observed a 
“crisis effect”, which indicates that attention to a 
crisis is greatest during and immediately 
following a crisis event, but drops to very low 
levels between crisis events.  The phenomenon, 
which seems common across society, creates 
windows of opportunity for advancing risk 
management objectives.   For example, 
following the summer 2005 heavy rain events 
that afflicted several southern Ontario 
communities and caused an estimated $400 
million in damages, the City of Hamilton city 
council appointed an expert panel to examine 
how to prevent or reduce damaging floods.

Climate change impacts across many areas, 
and successful adaptation requires a 
coordinated, multi-dimensional response that 
can not likely be implemented by a single 
department.  Some municipalities have 
established the important role of “bridge-builder”.  
Bridge-builders3 build networks across 
departments and external organizations in order 
to draw together the stakeholders and expertise 
to tackle various issues.  They are critically 
important people in efforts to initiate and sustain 
successful adaptation to climate change. 
Governance conflicts may arise in two-tiered 
municipalities.  Responsibilities may lie with the 
upper-tier government, but potential impacts 
may occur at the lower-tier level.  Effective 
working relationships, shared objectives and a 
conscious effort to streamline governance and 
avoid duplicated efforts are necessary in order 
to avoid conflicts and inefficiencies.  In the case 
of emergency management, additional issues In 
the case of emergency management, additional 
issues may arise when local emergencies 
escalate into regional emergencies. 
4.  The challenge of getting started 
Ontario municipalities commonly share the 
following attributes that hinder efforts to initiate 
climate change risk management initiatives: 
•  Few or no surplus people or other resources 

for pursuing the climate change issue; 

•  Limited understanding of climate change 

across relevant departments; and 

•  Tendency to attend to crises during or 
immediately after a crisis event, but not 
between events. 

Many municipal staff are fully occupied with 
existing responsibilities so it can be very difficult 
to attend to new issues.  In order to pursue a 
new initiative, such as a climate change risk 
management initiative, they need to establish it 
as a priority over, and thereby displace an 
existing responsibility.  To do so, staff would 
typically need to prepare and present a strong 
business case and business plan for approval by 
a senior management team.  However, with little 
or no time to dedicate to preparing a business 
plan, doing so can be a challenge.  It is a classic 
chicken and egg problem.

municipalities.  Two municipal participants, a Director

Annex 3:  Risk communications and Perceptions 
 
Introduction:   
An individual or a work team that will be making 
decisions about risk should understand the risk 
in terms of the needs, issues, and concerns of 
the affected stakeholders.  There will also be a 
requirement to communicate with a broad 
variety of individuals, organisations, informal 
groups, the news media and governments about 
risk.  This Annex provides some insights into the 
difficulties of understanding perceptions about 
risk and some thoughts about how to effectively 
communicate about risks.   
Risk Perception - How Different People Value 
Things Differently: 
The value associated with something that may 
be lost or is at risk differs from one individual to 
another.  It can also differ for the same 
individual, depending on his or her 
circumstances at the time.  Consider individual 
responses to extremely hot weather.  A worker 
in an air conditioned building, who travels to 
work from an air conditioned apartment complex 
in air conditioned public transit may not feel 
much stress or discomfort.  On the other hand, 
an outside worker who lives in an uncooled 
apartment and drives to work in a car without air 
conditioning would find the heat very stressful.  
The two individuals perceive the value of air 
conditioning quite differently because of their 
differing needs and priorities at the time.  The 
inside worker would find the risk of losing his air-
conditioned environment much more disturbing 
than the outside worker 
This sense of value may also vary a lot 
depending on the time or other transient factors. 
For example, the inside worker’s valuation of his 
air-conditioned environment may be 
substantially lower in the cool early morning than 
in the heat of the afternoon.  If the air 
conditioning is too cold, it may not be wanted at 
all.  In fact over air conditioning may generate a  
negative value if the person gets sick from being 
too cool. 
Now consider the risk of losing the air-
conditioning completely.  If the weather is very 
hot, the inside worker may find any risk of losing 
the air-conditioning unacceptable.  If, on the 
other hand, the weather is very cool, he or she 
may be indifferent to losing the air-conditioning.   

 

34

The acceptability of the risk depends on the 
value or utility placed on the item at risk (in the 
example above, air-conditioning), which 
depends on the needs of that individual, at that 
specific time. 
Not all considerations of utility are time-
sensitive.  For example, if we value the 
environment, we probably always will value the 
environment.  If we are concerned about a 
changing climate, we will probably always be 
concerned about the changing climate and how 
to adapt to it.  The terms “needs”, “issues”, and 
“concerns” are often used to refer to those 
factors that affect our perceptions of risk. 
Different people can value the same loss 
differently because the loss may affect their 
overall satisfaction, or their needs, issues, and 
concerns, differently.  
The issue of perceived value has been often 
overlooked in dealing with risk situations when 
the risk is based on the simple equation: 

Risk = Probability x Consequence 

Many think that this equation is inadequate as a 
practical definition of risk when the perception or 
acceptability of risk is included and that a more 
appropriate expression of risk would be: 

Risk = Probability x Consequence x 

Perception 

Consider another example related to the 
perception or acceptability of risk of lowered 
water levels in a lake by two communities with 
different concerns and perceptions.  One 
community derives much of its income and 
employment from commercial marine traffic in its 
harbour.  Another community, also situated on 
the lakeshore, values the lake for its scenery 
and for light recreational use. 
As a result of a changing climate, both 
communities are told that lake levels are likely to 
be between 1 and 1.5 metres lower by 2050.  
The first community will face disastrous 
employment and economic losses because the 
main shipping channel for which it is the main 
port will be too shallow for the heavy marine 
traffic that now uses it.  An alternate channel 
with greater depth will still be navigable and 

another port city would benefit from the shift in 
traffic. 
The impact of lower water levels on the second 
community would be relatively minor and its 
shoreline is fairly steep and would still 
accommodate recreational boating and marinas.   
How each community perceives the risk and 
what kinds of actions will be needed on the part 
of decision-makers will depend upon the value 
placed on the impact of the changed water 
levels.  For the first community, huge amounts of 
resources will be needed to deepen the main 
shipping channel and the harbour facilities 
themselves.  This in turn may be very 
threatening to the marine ecosystems in the 
area.  For the second community, very little 
financial or environmental costs are anticipated. 
Even though both communities face the same 
risk of lowered water levels the first sees this as 
a major challenge which threatens the viability 
and economic well-being of its residents.  The 
second views it as a minor inconvenience.  Even 
though the probability associated with lowered 
water levels is the same, and the consequence 
of the potential loss is very different.   
The acceptability of the risk and how it can vary 
from one community to the next is not the same 
because the value placed on the potential loss 
can differ completely.  This is because the 
needs, issues, and concerns differ widely.  
Decision-makers often overlook or ignore these 
differences in perceived value and, as a result, 
many decisions create controversy. 
Risk Communications – How to Talk to 
People about Risks: 
General:  Risk communication goes beyond 
simple messages providing information.  It is 
based on a dialogue that allows stakeholders to 
participate in the decision-making process.   
Some reasons why providing information 
through simple public relations releases or one-
way public education are not useful strategies 
include: 
(a)  They will not reduce the conflict that will 

probably develop concerning a risk and what 
to do about it, 

(b)  Because people do not have the same 

ability to understand and relate to a 
particular risk, these strategies do not 
ensure that decisions will be easily 

 

understood and supported by stakeholders, 
and 

(c)  Providing people with scientific information 
alone will not enable them or the decision-
maker to resolve important risk issues. 
Not to communicate with stakeholders or to 
delay communicating about risk is not effective 
an effective strategy and may be very costly in 
the long term.  The reasons are that 
stakeholders resent risks that are imposed on 
them and risk decisions made without their 
input.  Most people believe that they have a right 
to be involved in the decisions that affect them 
and that the decision-making process should be 
accessible.  Involving stakeholders builds 
acceptance and can bring out constructive 
ideas.  Effectively communicating about risks is 
important.   
Effective Risk Communication:  Effective risk 
communication is the responsibility of the 
decision maker, not the stakeholder.  The most 
important benefits of an effective risk dialogue 
strategy are that it leads to shared 
understanding, shared goals and better 
decisions.  It builds trust and encourages buy-in 
by reducing misperceptions and improving the 
understanding of the science and technical 
aspects of the risk. 
On the other hand, ineffective risk 
communications may lead to some or all of the 
following: 
• 
•  Unnecessary, costly and possibly bitter and 

Irreplaceable loss of credibility,  

protracted debates and conflicts with 
stakeholders,  

•  Difficult and expensive approval processes 

for projects, 

•  Diversion of management attention from 

important problems to less important 
problems, 

•  Non-supportive and critical co-workers and 

employees, and  

•  Unnecessary human suffering due to high 

levels of anxiety and fear. 

Credibility:  Credibility, being seen by 
stakeholders as trustworthy and competent, is a 
key goal.  The characteristics of credibility 
include candour, commitment, competence, 
dedication, empathy, honesty, resolve, respect, 
and understanding.  Credible messages must be 
based on known facts and with previous 

 

35

statements.  They should be framed in 
stakeholder terms, not self-serving language or 
jargon, and be consistent with the messages of 
others.  Credibility is very difficult to establish, 
easy to lose and almost impossible to regain 
once lost.  For this reason some specialised 
training in risk communications is recommended 
prior to initiating the risk management process. 
Stakeholders:   It can be extremely important to 
include even minor stakeholders in the process 
if these stakeholders believe that the outcome of 
the decision is important to them.  These "minor" 
players may be much more influential than the 
risk management team anticipates.  Even a 
small group of stakeholders may effectively 
mobilize public opinion and halt or delay an 
activity they feel presents an unacceptable risk.   

For example, a local environmental 
group rallied to stop greenhouse gas 
collection project being built because 
they believed the facility could worsen 
the community’s air pollution problem.  
Even though the risk was very small 
from a technical point of view the 
environmental group believed that it was 
still unacceptable.  Because the 
company sponsoring the project failed to 
address these specific concerns and 
even though all the other key 
stakeholders supported the project, this 
small group effectively mobilized public 
opinion against it.  The company, after 
spending a large amount of time, effort, 
and money, was forced to withdraw its 
permit request.   

It is important that stakeholders with the 
potential to stop a project be identified as early 
in the process as possible. 
Regardless of whether stakeholders might 
actually be affected by an activity or decision, 
they must be included as legitimate stakeholders 
if they believe themselves to be affected. These 
stakeholders may be able to mobilize public 
opinion against a proposed project regardless of 
the scientific risk.  They may also choose to 
leave the decision process if they receive 
enough credible information to understand that 
the activity really does not affect them. 

For example, in the greenhouse gas 
collection project described above, if the 
company had analysed the 
environmental groups’ concerns it would 

 

have found that their information was 
based on a number of misconceptions 
related to some technical and social 
aspects of the activity.  Through a 
dialogue process, the concerns of the 
environmental group were addressed, 
and the misconceptions about the 
technical issues were corrected. As a 
result the group’s concerns were 
alleviated and the project went ahead.  

This stresses the need for an effective 
communication process to facilitate this transfer 
of information between the decision-maker and 
other stakeholders. 
It is important that the risk management team 
clearly decides what the stakeholders’ needs, 
issues and concerns are before proceeding with 
a stakeholder dialogue.  There are numerous 
examples of decision-makers addressing the 
wrong issue.  

For example, again in the greenhouse 
gas collection project when the 
company carefully analysed the 
environmental groups’ concerns they 
believed that the key issue for the group 
would be emissions from the project.  
However, through a careful dialogue 
with the group the company also found 
out that a secondary issue was related 
to transportation.  The group thought 
that the new GHG collection facility, 
because it was the first the region, 
would result in a dramatic increase 
tourist traffic that would create a risk for 
their children.  Once this and the 
emissions issues were addressed, the 
stakeholders were satisfied. 

Trust:  Stakeholders often believe that the 
process of communicating with them about an 
issue is as important as the eventual resolution 
of the issue.  It is through the dialogue process 
that the risk management team has the 
opportunity to gain stakeholders' trust.  If the risk 
management team fails to communicate to the 
satisfaction of the stakeholders, trust in the 
process could be quickly lost.  
Research in the area of stakeholder perception 
has shown that "trust" is a key determinant of 
stakeholders' acceptance of risk. That is, if 
stakeholders trust those who are charged with 
managing the risk, they are more accepting of 
higher levels of risk. Where this trust is absent, 

 

36

 

stakeholders demand higher levels of safety, 
and may refuse to accept any risk at all. 
The development of trust between stakeholder 
and decision-maker is only one of the benefits of 
an effective communication process. 
Stakeholders are often the source of information 
critical to the decision-process.   

For example, during a prolonged 
extreme heat episode, a municipality 
issued instructions through the Chief of 
Police that people who were suffering 
heat stress effects should report to the 
local militia armouries for help.  Very few 
people showed up even though there 
was a lot of evidence to suggest that 
many citizens were suffering.   

The Mayor had a new announcement 
put out through the city’s Medical Officer 
of Health for people with heat stress to 
come to the local high school for help.  
Most responded positively to this 
announcement.  

The communication process is necessary so 
that information may be passed effectively from 
the risk management team to stakeholders. The 
same process is used to evaluate stakeholder 
acceptance of risk.  Sometimes stakeholders 
just want to be involved in the decision process 
so that they can monitor the performance of the 
decision-maker and to see what is going on. 
Again, by involving stakeholders "who just want 
to watch" provides the decision-maker with the 
opportunity to build trust with these 
stakeholders.

Climate change – a change of climate that is 
attributed directly or indirectly to human activity 
that alters the composition of the global 
atmosphere and which is in addition to natural 
climate variability observed over comparable 
time periods. (UNFCCC) 
Climate scenario – projection of future climatic 
conditions 
Climate variability – climate variability refers to 
fluctuations in climate over a shorter term - the 
departures from long-term averages or trends, 
over seasons or a few years, such as those 
caused by the El Niño Southern Oscillation 
phenomenon. (UNFCCC) 
Consequences – Risk is often expressed as the 
product of the consequences flowing from an 
event and the frequency of the event.  In this 
manual, we use the term “impacts” for 
consistency with the terminology of climate 
change. 
Dialogue – a process for two-way 
communication that fosters shared 
understanding. It is supported by information. 
Hazard – a source of potential harm, or a 
situation with a potential for causing harm, in 
terms of human injury; damage to health,

organisation able to affect, be affected by, or 
believe it might be affected by, a decision or 
activity.  The decision-makers are also 
stakeholders. 
Stakeholder analysis – Identification of 
individuals or groups who are likely to have an 
interest in the risk management issue including 
a consideration of what their needs issues and 
concerns would be and how the stakeholder 
should be included in the process.

UNFCCC – United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change (1992) 
Vulnerability – the degree to which a system is 
susceptible to, or unable to cope with, adverse
