ExECuTivE Summary

GlObal miTiGaTiON EffOrTS are underway to curb 
greenhouse gas emissions, but unless concerted 
action happens soon, further and more extreme 
changes may become unavoidable. Scientists 
project that Vancouver will experience increased 
annual precipitation and temperatures, with 
hotter, drier summers. More intense and frequent 
rain and wind storms are anticipated, and sea 
level rise will pose a significant challenge by 
mid-century. Adaptation refers to actions taken 
to respond to the impacts of climate change by 
taking advantage of opportunities, or reducing 
the associated risks.
there is significant overlap between climate 
change adaptation, mitigation and sustainability 
measures including those designed to improve 
greenspace, foster urban agriculture and facilitate  
improvements in buildings and urban infrastructure.  
Adaptation more explicitly engages a wider range  
of issues, particularly emergency management, 
health and the needs of vulnerable populations in 
a changing climate. Many existing City actions are 

already forwarding adaptation, and the focus of the 
Climate Change Adaptation Strategy is to build on  
these actions and propose new ‘no regret’ actions – 
those that benefit the community regardless of the 
extent of climate change we eventually experience.
Strategy development began last spring and loosely  
followed the iCLei “Changing Climate, Changing  
Communities” guide. the first step included working 
with the pacific Climate impacts Consortium at 
UVic to acquire a detailed understanding of  
anticipated changes to the regional climate. Using 
these climate projections, impacts to the City were  
identified through interviews with general managers  
and working group meetings. impacts were prior-
itized through a risk and vulnerability assessment, 
and adaptation actions were devised and evaluated  
through staff workshops. the Adaptation Steering  
Committee provided final review and comment 
on the Strategy. implementation of the Strategy 
will be the responsibility of department staff with 
coordination and support from the Sustainability 
group. 

the Strategy includes primary and supporting  
actions which are all detailed in a matrix in  
Appendix A, including accountability and priority. 
proposed actions were evaluated based on their 
effectiveness; overlap with sustainability and  
mitigation goals; cost-benefit ratio; and time horizon 
for anticipated impacts. they are prioritized into the 
categories of ‘must do’, ‘monitor’ and ‘investigate 
further’, with capital planning cycle integration 
for ‘must do’ items. 
primary adaptation actions focus on incorporating 
adaptation as a consideration or key driver into 
existing and planned projects. they include:
•   Completing a comprehensive integrated  

Stormwater Management plan and continuing 
with sewer separation;

•  Completing a coastal flood risk assessment;
•  Amending flood-proofing policies; 
•  Completing an urban forest management plan;
•   including climate change adaptation measures 

in the next Vancouver Building Bylaw update;

•  developing a back-up power policy; and
•  implementing water conservation actions.
the Strategy is a living document and will continue 
 to be revised and updated as climate change 
science and adaptation practice evolve. As this 
is the first Adaptation Strategy for Vancouver, 
many of the proposed actions focus on increasing  
our understanding of coming challenges and  
integrating climate change into planning, design 
and emergency management.

the Strategy is a living document and will continue to be revised and updated  
as climate change science and adaptation practice evolves. As this is the 
first Adaptation Strategy for Vancouver, many of the proposed actions focus 
on increasing our understanding of coming challenges and integrating climate 
change into planning, design and emergency management. Successive iterations  
of the Strategy will yield more detailed actions.
Many adaptation activities are already in place at the City driven by the need  
to manage observed climate changes, or to meet sustainability imperatives 
such as water conservation. this Strategy takes a “no regrets” approach to 
climate policy by identifying actions that build on these existing activities to 
improve community resiliency and generate benefits whether the extent of 
anticipated climate change materializes or not. 
the Strategy begins with an overview and context for adaptation in Vancouver  
including adaptation basics and Vancouver’s future climate (chapters one  
to three). Chapter four focuses on understanding the impacts and the cross- 
cutting issues they represent. Chapter five identifies the primary and supporting 
actions with a companion comprehensive action matrix located in Appendix A.  
A brief description of plan implementation and maintenance procedures 
conclude the plan. 

iNTrODuCTiON

ClimaTE ChaNGE iS clearly supported by both observed trends and peer reviewed 
scientific research. Some climate change is now inevitable and there is evidence 
the world over that changes are already taking place. global mitigation  
efforts are underway to curb greenhouse gas emissions, but unless concerted  
action happens soon, further and more extreme changes may become  
unavoidable. preparing for these changes –adapting to climate change –  
is a warranted and complementary strategy. the City of Vancouver is a  
recognized leader in climate change mitigation, and adding adaptation to our 
business will ensure that we can continue to meet City goals cost effectively 
over time. 
Scientists project that Vancouver will experience increased annual precipitation  
and temperatures, with hotter, drier summers. More intense and frequent 
rain and wind storms are anticipated and sea level rise will pose a significant 
challenge by mid-century. these changes mean an increasing risk of overland 
and coastal flooding, damage from storms and overheating during summer 
highs. Without action, these risks threaten a wide spectrum of City goals 
from economic prosperity to liveability.
Vancouver is joining a group of leading cities in europe, Australia and the United 
States that have developed and implemented climate change adaptation actions. 
Vancouver’s Adaptation Strategy is a priority action in both the greenest 
City plan and the Corporate Strategic Business plan. the City joined the 
iCLei Climate Change Adaptation initiative pilot in late 2010 along with a 
cohort of local and regional governments across Canada. participants work 
through iCLei’s five milestone methodology with the goal of developing and 
implementing a climate change adaptation strategy over two years.
this Adaptation Strategy focuses on understanding the climate impacts today 
and how they are expected to change in the coming century. it provides a 
framework for identifying and prioritizing vulnerabilities and risks and then 
exploring measures to reduce the risk imposed by climate impacts. it will 
guide development of policies and programs to build resiliency into everyday 
operations and short and long-term infrastructure investments. Accountability 
for the actions lies primarily with the City but also with external partners. 
We need to maintain or enhance the infrastructure, programs and services 
that make Vancouver one of the most liveable cities in the world, even as 
storms worsen and sea levels increase.

ViSion, PrinCiPleS anD goalS

Strategy ViSion: 

to ensure that Vancouver remains a liveable and resilient city, maintaining  
its values, character and charm in the face of climate change.

guiDing PrinCiPleS:

•   Use the best science available at the time of planning and review regularly.

of future options available.

•   give priority to adaptation strategies that build on existing programs or 
policies and provide co-benefits with mitigation and sustainability goals. 

•   Aim for integration into department business, “mainstreaming”, versus 

entirely new-staffed projects.

•   establish and maintain strong networks with First nations and other levels 

of government as well as with partners such as the port, the Board of 
trade and the Vancouver economic Commission. 

•   Adaptation efforts should be mindful of, and include, planning to meet  

the unique needs and conditions of people who are most vulnerable. 

goalS:

development and implementation of this strategy will:
•   increase the resilience of City infrastructure, programs and services  

to anticipated local climate change impacts.

•   promote and facilitate the incorporation of climate change information 

into City business. 

•   improve awareness, knowledge, skills and resources of City staff.
•   enhance opportunities for coordination and cooperation through  

the development of networks and partnerships.

1.1 mitigation anD aDaPtation

ClimaTE ChaNGE miTiGaTiON refers to the ongoing 
attempts to prevent significant climate change 
through the reductions of greenhouse gases in 
the atmosphere. the City of Vancouver has been 
a leader in mitigation for over a decade. in 1990, 
the Clouds of Change task force was created by 
Council to study issues related to atmospheric 
change. one of their recommendations was to 
study adaptive measures and begin planning long- 
term measure to adapt to possible consequences 
of climate change. 
in 2003, the Cool Vancouver task force connected  
government, industry, citizens and non-government  
organizations working toward the common goal of  
reducing greenhouse gas emissions in Vancouver. 
the greenest City Action team, charged with 
making Vancouver the greenest city in the world 
by 2020, was formed in 2009. the resulting 
greenest City plan, released in July, 2011, includes  
mitigation actions and an action directing  
development of an adaptation strategy under  
the Climate Leadership goal.

figure 1: mitigation and adaptation to Climate Change

the City of Vancouver’s mitigation commitment 
is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the 
community by 33% below 2007 levels by 2020. 
the reduction pathways identified include energy 
efficient buildings, district energy, transportation 
and vehicle changes, reduced landfill waste and 
clean electricity. 
Adaptation refers to actions taken to respond to 
the impacts of climate change by taking advantage  
of opportunities or reducing the associated risks. 
examples of adaptation actions include modifi-
cations of coastal development to account for 
sea level rise, provision of heat refuges during 
heat waves, planting hardy or suitable plants and 
dealing with increases in beach erosion. 
Mitigation and adaptation are not mutually  
exclusive, with many actions contributing to both 
goals. examples include water conservation and 
effective building envelopes which reduce gHgs 
now, but also mitigate the effects of extended 
hotter, drier weather in the future. Sustainability 
goals in general, as detailed in the greenest City 
plan, have extensive overlap with adaptation and 
mitigation actions. integration of the Adaptation 
Strategy with greenest City plan actions was 
completed in development of this strategy. 

1.2  role of loCal goVernment  

in aDaPtation

it is widely recognized that adaptation is most 
effective at the regional and community scale. 
exposure to hazards, vulnerability, adaptive  
capacity and risk are all place-based in nature and  
many of the impacts anticipated from climate 
change will affect the services and infrastructure 
for which local governments have the primary  

responsibility. Local governments also have 
many of the tools necessary for adaptation such 
as planning, codes, standards and emergency 
response. 
Local governments also invest in capital projects 
and programs that are expected to serve the City 
over many decades. given current replacement 
rates, new buildings will account for an equal or 
greater fraction of building stock within climate 
change timeframes. the cost of no action, both 
from a future retrofit and public safety perspective,  
could be much higher than proactively planning 
infrastructure to be resilient to future climate. 
the cost to build a new house, bridge or trans-
mission line that is adapted to climate change for 
its lifecycle will only add 0% to 5% to construction  
costs which is significantly cheaper than restoring  
infrastructure post damage, retrofitting, rebuilding  
or an increased lifetime maintenance bill.1 economic  
value at risk from climate change was estimated  
at between 1% and 12% of gdp by 2030 for  
various global locations. the same study found 
that between 40% and 68% of these losses could 
be averted through adaptation measures for 
which economic benefits outweigh costs.2 the 
national round table on the environment and 
the economy completed a cost benefit analysis 
of implementing proactive adaptation actions 
versus dealing with the consequences when they 
occur. they concluded that adaptation was a 
cost effective way of dealing with many climate 
change impacts.3 According to a recent University  
of Waterloo research project, climate change 
adaptation is “simply good and smart business 
for Canada”. 4

Local governments have a duty of care to their 
citizens to ensure development decisions do not 
create the potential for unmanageable exposure 
to hazards. they also have a special responsibility 
to those members of society who are more  
vulnerable to impacts from climate change. 
to adapt to climate change, local governments 
will have to alter their traditional regulatory and 
design regimes to incorporate future projections 
into decision-making. Many north American cities 
are well on their way to doing this and Vancouver’s  
efforts start here.

1.3 aDaPtation DefinitionS:

adaptation: in human systems, adaptation is 
the process of adjustment to actual or expected 
climate and its effects, in order to moderate harm 
or exploit beneficial opportunities.5 Adaptation is 
a function of Vulnerability and risk. 
Vulnerability: is the degree to which a system is 
susceptible to, or unable to cope with a particular  
climate change impact. it is a function of the 
character, magnitude and rate of climate variation  
to which a system is exposed; its sensitivity and 
its adaptive capacity.6

Vulnerability =

 exposure x Sensitivity x adaptive Capacity

exposure and Sensitivity: are almost inseparable  
properties of a system (or community). A coastal   
community like Vancouver is exposed to sea level 
rise while an okanagan community may be ex-
posed to drought. Sensitivity is the degree to which  

the system is affected. At the municipal level, iCLei  
suggests assessing sensitivity by considering  
existing stresses that make a department sensitive  
and how much the performance or function of an  
area may be affected by a climate change impact. 
adaptive Capacity: is similar to, or closely related  
to, a host of other commonly used concepts,  
including adaptability, coping ability, management  
capacity, stability, flexibility and resilience. the 
determinants of adaptive capacity are the forces 
that influence the ability of the system to adapt 
such as managerial ability; access to financial, 
technological and information resources; infra-
structure; institutional environment; political  
influence; kinship networks, etc. Adaptive capacity  
is context-specific and varies from community  
to community and among social groups and  
individuals, and over time.7
Vulnerability assessment: the process to prioritize  
climate change risks focusing on where we 
are the most susceptible. Vulnerability is a key 
determinant of potential impacts and disasters. 
For example, a heat wave can have very different 
impacts on distinctive populations depending on 
their vulnerability. 
Climate Change risk: is a combined function of 
the probability of a hazard (an event with the 
potential to cause harm, e.g. floods, droughts) 
occurring and the magnitude or severity of its 
potential consequences (injury, damage, loss  
of habitat etc.). 8

risk = 

likelihood (probability) x Consequence

risk assessment: the process to prioritize 
climate change risks focusing on the potential 
consequences of an impact. 
Disaster risk management: improving the under-
standing of disaster risk; fostering disaster risk  
reduction and transfer; and promoting continuous  
improvement in disaster preparedness, response, 
and recovery practices, with the explicit purpose 
of increasing human security, well-being, quality 
of life, resilience, and sustainable development.9
resilience: resilience is the ability of a system 
and its component parts to anticipate, absorb, 
accommodate, or recover from the effects of a 
hazardous event in a timely and efficient manner, 
including ensuring the preservation, restoration, 
or improvement of its essential basic structures 
and functions.10

2.1 oVerView

iN 2008, iClEi Canada, with support from natural resources Canada, embarked  
on a pilot project that guided three Canadian municipalities (delta, BC; greater  
Sudbury, on and St. John’s, nL) through an American adaptation process  
developed by iCLei-USA and the University of Washington. the pilot project  
identified the needs of Canadian municipalities, the gaps in Canadian resources  
available to them and future steps for municipal adaptation planning. these 
lessons were integral in development of a Canadian-specific guidebook: iCLei  
Canada’s Changing Climate, Changing Communities: guide and Workbook 
for Municipal Climate Adaptation. 
As participants in the iCLei Adaptation initiative, Vancouver followed the 
five-milestone methodology outlined in the aforementioned guidebook.  
the purpose of the methodology is to convey a holistic, straightforward  
approach for municipalities to investigate climate change impacts and  
devise strategies for addressing these impacts. 
there are generally two recognized approaches to adaptation planning: 
impact assessment and vulnerability assessment. impact assessments 
are described as top down; working from the identification of anticipated 
impacts. Vulnerability assessments are bottom up; identifying areas where 
the community is sensitive and exposed to change. Both vulnerability and 
impact assessments can sit comfortably within a broad risk assessment 
framework –a systematic methodology to identify, assess, communicate  
and manage risks. the iCLei milestones follow a risk assessment format. 
the Five iCLei Milestones are: initiate, research, plan, implement and Monitor/ 
iterate. Figure 2 below outlines the main questions addressed in each milestone.  
note that this Strategy is a result of Milestones one to three. Milestones 4 
and 5 follow adoption of the Strategy. 

2.2 the aDaPtation team:

deputy City Manager, Sadhu Johnston, played an important role as Adaptation 
Champion. He helped solidify awareness and commitment to adaptation 
planning within the organization and communicated our work to external 
stakeholders and partners. City engineer, peter Judd, our executive sponsor,  
was also integral as an avid supporter of preparing for the impacts of climate  
change and ensuring resilient infrastructure over time. 
An inter-departmental working group on adaptation was established in 2008  
when initial investigation was completed. the group was re-convened in 2011 
to support work on the iCLei adaptation process. the Adaptation Working  
group completed many of the worksheets and tasks associated with the 
milestones and provided a link back to their respective departments. A sea  
level rise working group and adaptation steering committee were both  
established late in the planning process as the need arose. Many staff members  
were involved throughout the adaptation planning process from identifying 
impacts to prioritizing and reviewing actions.

in Milestone one, general managers from across the organization were inter-
viewed to introduce them to the planning effort and garner their initial feedback  
on impacts and department specific actions. research on anticipated changes  
to climate variables (rain, wind, temperature) was presented as a basis for 
impact identification by the gMs and subsequently by the working group. 
Milestone one also included a scan of existing policies, programs, plans and 
bylaws to identify existing adaptation actions and opportunities to include 
adaptation considerations.
Milestone two focused on the risk and vulnerability assessments which were 
completed by the working group (see section 2.4). Starting with over 80 
identified impacts, the assessments prioritized the list to just over twenty key  
impacts. in collaboration with iCLei and pCiC, the georgia Basin Adaptation 
initiative participants commissioned a study of regional climate science to 
support adaptation planning. 
identification and prioritization of adaptation actions dominated milestone 
three. departmental workshops focused on brainstorming actions to respond  
to, or minimize the risk imposed by impacts affecting the department. 
Workshops included a mapping exercise to identify assets vulnerable to 

2.4 Strategy DeVeloPment

the vulnerability and risk assessments were the primary tool used in Strategy  
development. the assessments focused this round of adaptation planning on  
those impacts that we are the most susceptible to, and that will have the 
greatest consequences. please refer to Appendix B for more detailed information  
from the vulnerability and risk assessment. 

2.4.1 VulneraBility aSSeSSment

Vulnerability refers to the susceptibility of a given service area to harm arising  
from climate change impacts. it is a function of a department’s sensitivity to 
climate change and its capacity to adapt to impacts with little to no cost or 
disruption. Medium and high vulnerability impacts are moved on to the risk 
assessment. 

Vulnerability = 

Sensitivity x adaptive Capacity 

Sensitivity
to conduct a sensitivity assessment, Vancouver’s Adaptation Working group 
looked at each identified impact and assessed how the functionality of the 
primary department would be affected if the impact were to occur. Vancouver  
decided to look at the sensitivity of the primary department between now 
and 2080. Sensitivity was ranked on a scale of 1 to 5. 
adaptive Capacity 
inherent to the analysis of adaptive capacity is the assumption that certain 
systems can accommodate changes in climate with minimal disruption or 
additional cost. those systems which cannot accommodate changes have  
a low adaptive capacity. 

7

in order to measure Vancouver’s adaptive capacity, impacts were assessed 
based on the cost and amount of staff intervention that would be needed 
to adapt. engineering was most frequently identified as having low adaptive 
capacity; a direct reflection of how built infrastructure is generally unable to 
accommodate major changes in climate without additional costs and potentially 
significant disruptions. 
given sensitivity and adaptive capacity, vulnerability is ranked as follows.

High

Sensitivity

Low

likelihood 
to determine the likelihood, Vancouver characterized the impact as a single 
event (windstorm) or a recurring event (increasing annual rainfall). A likelihood  
rating from 1 to 5 was then assigned where 1 is “rare” and 5 is “almost certain”.
Consequence 
the second step of a risk assessment is to evaluate the consequence of an  
impact. Using a relatively common risk assessment matrix, Vancouver looked  
at how the impacts would affect five areas: public safety, local economy and 
growth, community and lifestyle, environment and sustainability, and public 
administration. Matrix ratings ranged from 1 (negligible) to 5 (catastrophic). 
the sum of all the consequence values was then totalled to give the impact 
an overall consequence rating. 
Consequence and likelihood are then multiplied to obtain a risk rating on the 
following scale.

risk is a function of the likelihood and consequence of an impact where  
likelihood refers to the probability of the projected impact occurring, and 
consequence refers to the known or estimated effects (economic, ecological,  
social or legal) of a particular impact. 

risk =

likelihood x Consequence

Workshops were held with staff across the organization to brainstorm actions  
to prepare for, or reduce risks from, the prioritized impacts. Workshop  
participants then reviewed a consolidated list of potential actions before  
the working group evaluated them. Criteria from the Canadian Communities’ 
guidebook for Adaptation to Climate Change were used to rank the actions. 
the criteria and ranking descriptions are listed in table 1. 
Actions with low scores were discussed and most often discarded. others were  
ranked into the following categories: “must do”, “monitor” or “investigate 
further”. Must do actions are those that have a high benefit to cost ratio 
and those with a short time horizon until impacts are likely to be observed. 
in consultation with staff, must do actions were further prioritized by date 
of the capital planning cycle they will be implemented by. Actions that are 

tagged as “monitor” are actions that have good benefit to cost ratio but given  
long timelines until anticipated impacts, it makes sense to wait to implement 
these actions until certain thresholds of climate change are observed. Lastly, 
“investigate further” are actions where the benefit to cost ratio is unclear 
and more consideration is required.

•   there is high agreement and much evidence 
that with current climate change mitigation 
policies and related sustainable development 
practices, global gHg emissions will continue 
to grow over the next few decades.

•   observational evidence from all continents and 
most oceans shows that many natural systems 
are being affected by regional climate changes, 
particularly temperature increases.

the ipCC rates the likelihood of projected trends 
for the 21st century as follows:
•   Virtually certain (>99% likelihood) that decreases  

in frequency and magnitude of cold extremes 
will occur. 

•   1 in 20 year extreme daily temperature (exceeded  

once between 1981 and 2000) is likely (>66% 
likelihood) to become a 1 in 2 or 1 in 5 year event.

•   Very likely (>90% likelihood) that mean sea 
level rise will contribute to upward trends in 
extreme coastal high water levels in the future.

•   Likely that the frequency of heavy precipitation 

or the proportion of total rainfall from heavy 
events will increase.

•   1 in 20 year annual maximum daily precipitation 
amount is likely to become a 1 in 5 to 1 in 15 year  
event by the end of the century.

the pacific Climate impacts Consortium (pCiC) 
at the University of Victoria completed a study 
of regional projections for all georgia Basin iCLei 
Adaptation initiative participants. Basic data from 
the study are included in this chapter with more 
detail available in the full report. A general study 
finding was that projected change by the 2050s 
appears modest while by the 2080s projected 
change describes a future climate that is almost 
unrecognizable in comparison to historical climate. 

Our ClimaTE iNCluDES natural year-to-year fluctua- 
tions such as el niño/La niña and decadal cycles  
such as the pacific decadal oscillation. Climate 
change is the trend information that remains once  
the fluctuations of these natural cycles is removed.  
Historical observations reveal the trends while global  
and regional climate models provide insight into 
anticipated future climate. 
Climate is expected to change both in terms of 
annual and seasonal averages and in the frequency,  
intensity, duration and timing of extreme events. 
in B.C, 2011 was 0.51°C warmer than 1951-1980  
average values, and was ranked the ninth warmest  
year since 1880, with nine of the ten warmest 
years on record occurring since year 2000.11  
in terms of extreme events, a 3-hour heavy rainfall 
event that occurred on average once every 25 years  
in the past is projected to occur five and a half 
times more frequently by 2050. 

3.1 gloBal Climate Change

the intergovernmental panel on Climate Change 
released its first Special report on Managing 
the risks of extreme events and disasters to 
Advance Climate Change Adaptation (SreX) on 
March 28th, 2012. the following are conclusions 
from the report. 
•   Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, 
as is now evident from observations of increases 
in global average air and ocean temperatures, 
widespread melting of snow and ice and rising 
global average sea level.

the province of B.C. recommends using 0.5m global mean sea level 
increase to 2050, 1.0m to 2100 and 2.0m to 2200. there is a wide 
range of projections for sea level rise by 2100 from 45cm to over 2m.
extreme events 
Sea level rise will cause problems when experienced together with 
storm surge. detailed storm surge projections are not available.
An increase in extreme events is projected including windstorms 
and heavy rainfall. 

the following climate variables were modelled by  
pCiC for the region. they are all described against 
a 1961-1990 baseline unless otherwise stated. 
Precipitation as Snow: Vancouver’s drinking 
water comes from mountain reservoirs and the 
snowpack melt and rainfall that supply them. 
April 1 snowpack has decreased on average by 
25% in BC over the past 50 years with some sites 
experiencing a 50% reduction.12 
precipitation as snow is projected to decrease in 
the areas of Metro Vancouver that are important 
for water supply. reductions will be evident by 
the 2050s and precipitation as snow is projected 
almost to disappear by 2080. 
growing Degree Days: growing degree days 
(gdd) are an important indicator of opportunities  
for agriculture but may also increase the risk of 
invasive species spread. they are determined by 
the accumulation of degrees over 5°C per day. 
Annual gdds are a sum of degrees accumulated  
this way for each day of the year. regionally, 
modeled gdds are projected to increase by  
approximately one to two thirds in the 2050s and 
to as much as double by the 2080s from a baseline 
of approximately 1700 degree days. 
annual heating and Cooling degree days: Heating  
and cooling degree days are useful indicators 
of energy demands required for heating and 
cooling. HVAC systems, general building design, 
district energy systems and other energy infra-
structure all rely on this information. An approximate 
25% and 35% reduction by the 2050s and 2080s 
respectively in heating degree-days signals a  
significant reduction in cold season energy  
requirements.

As temperatures climb, cooling degree days increase. From a historical baseline  
of only 55 cooling degree-days annually in Metro Vancouver, projected 
increases range from at least double by the 2050s to as much as a factor of 
10 increase by the 2080s. Alternatives to vast application of air conditioning 
will need promotion in order to avoid adaptation that increases greenhouse 
gas emissions.
Summer day-time high temps: projected increases in summer day-time 
high temperatures indicate a summer climate by the 2050s between that  
of present-day Seattle and San diego.
frost free Period: Freeze-thaw can be hard on vegetation and infrastructure  
alike. the frost free period in the urban parts of the study area are already 
quite high with the majority of the year (roughly 200 days/year) frost free 
on average during the 1961-1990 period. projections indicate a new normal 
by the 2080s of virtually frost free conditions. 
fraser river hydrology: the portion of the Fraser contiguous with Vancouver  
is tidally dominated. nevertheless, changes in runoff timing and the seasonal  
distribution of runoff could have implications for water availability and habitat.  
By the 2050s winter and spring flows are projected to increase by 56% to 85%  
and 37% to 56% respectively and summer flow to decrease by 13% to 23% 
for the Fraser- Hope hydrometric station. the mean annual peak flow is 
projected to occur about 10 days earlier.13 

3.2.2 extremeS: 

the head of climate monitoring and attribution at the U.K’s Hadley centre for  
Climate Change, explains that for every 1 degree Celsius rise in temperature,  
the amount of moisture that the atmosphere can contain rises by 7% or more. 
“the upshot is that overall rainfall increases only 2% to 3% per degree of warming,  
where extreme rainfall increases 6% to 7%”.14 in basic terms, this is due to the  
large-scale energy balance of the planet. With extra moisture in the atmosphere, 
when precipitation does occur, it’s more likely to be in bigger events. 
Current observations support an increase in storm intensity. toronto recently  
initiated a program to improve storm drains after experiencing eight extreme  
storms (more than 1 in 25 year intensity) between 1986 and 2006. the 
insurance Bureau of Canada states that severe storm-related water damage 
has doubled since 1992 to 44% of claims.15 

13 (pCiC Update Vol V number 3. Spring 2012).

12

pCiC used eight regional Climate Models (rCMs) to project changes in extremes. 
the projected change from the 1971-2000 baseline period is projected for 
the 2050s (2041-2070) in all cases. in the case of warm days (table 3,  
first row), the ratio can be interpreted as warm days occurring 2.2 times  
as frequently by the 2050s.
extreme precipitation is projected to increase for all the precipitation indices.  
the percent of annual total precipitation that falls during events that are larger  
than the 95th percentile of events in the past is projected to increase by 
about 21% on average (table 3, row 2). percent of annual total precipitation 
falling during events larger than the 99th percentile of past events is projected  
to increase by 28% on average (table 3, row3).

periods are expected to change by 2050. A return period (or recurrence

floods) of a certain intensity of size. the table below shows the ratio of 
future to past return periods. For example, the median value of 5.8 for the

event that occurred every 25 years during the past (4% chance of occurring

Sea level rise is a direct impact of climate change that is caused when warmer  
temperatures trigger both melting of continental glaciers and ice caps and 
the thermal expansion of oceans. At the regional and local scale, sea level  
will also be affected by local ocean and weather characteristics such as  
salinity, wind and currents, and by the vertical movement of the land due  
to geological processes (subsidence and uplift).

during the last century sea level rose by almost 8” (20 cm). What is most 
notable is that the rate of rise is increasing rapidly, almost doubling in the 
last three decades.16 Based on present and expected increases in emissions 
in the near future, sea levels are expected to rise at accelerating rates into 
the next century. Close monitoring and measurement over the last fifteen 
years has shown that the present trend is close to, or above, the upper  
envelope of global scenarios. 
projections for sea level cover a range, with greater weighting in the middle, 
as in most probability curves. Moderate projections for global average sea 
level rise this century are approximately 3 feet (1 m), but a few recent papers 
have raised the upper limit to 6 feet (2 m). Such forecasts are regularly 
revised and have generally moved upward over the last decade as the extent 
of melting in greenland and Antarctica increased.17 Jurisdictions around the  
world are using various sea level rise figures in planning to the end of the 
21st century. the new Zealand Ministry of environment is suggesting a 0.8m  
increase in areas where impacts will have high consequences. the U.S Army 
Corps uses 1m and 1.5m for low and high scenarios respectively; the delta 
Committee of the netherlands uses a range from 0.55m to 1.2m and the Lowe  
Study for the U.K released 2.5m as the upper limit of scenarios by 2100. 
in May, 2011 the BC Ministry of environment released draft guidelines providing  
sea level rise figures for use in evaluation of existing dikes, flood-proofing 
requirements and long term land use and planning issues. in formulating the 
guidelines, the province created a sea level change envelope reflecting the 
ranges of the most recent peer reviewed scientific projections. they chose 
a median curve as the basis for defining policy in BC that translates to the 
figures in table 5 below.

imPaCTS aND iSSuES

aNTiCiPaTED ChaNGES TO climate variables, as  
described in Chapter 3, will cause impacts felt 
across City departments. An example of a climate  
change impact is increased street flooding caused  
by increases in intensity and duration of rainfall.  
impacts share common overarching themes 
that are briefly discussed in this chapter to help 
decision-makers, working on these policy areas, 
identify climate risks and opportunities. 

4.1 imPaCtS

From Chapter 3, the most relevant climate change  
impacts Vancouver will experience are:
•   Flooding and/or inundation due to sea level rise;
•   overland flooding due to increased frequency 

and intensity of precipitation;

•   damage from increased frequency and intensity 

of wind and rain storms; and

•   Health impacts from more days of extreme 

warm temperatures and heat waves.

overall changes in climate trends such as warmer, 
drier summers and more extreme events will also 
cause impacts. See table 6 for all the prioritized 
impacts. 
Several Vancouver characteristics standout as 
significant vulnerabilities to climate change  
which in turn drive adaptation priorities. 
•   Lower income households; the homeless and 

those housed in poor quality housing are  
particularly vulnerable to climate change and 
natural hazards due to where they live within 
cities, the lack of reliable basic services, and their 
shortage of resources to deal with disruption. 

•   Low-lying coastal and Fraser-fronting areas  

include significant infrastructure, neighbourhoods, 
ecosystems and are central to Vancouver’s  
aesthetic and amenity-centred charm. 

table 6 summarizes the impacts that were prior- 
itized through the vulnerability and risk assessments. 
impacts are organized by the expected climate 
change (high level impact in the case of sea level  
rise). the general changes category includes 
impacts felt from a collection of the other climate 
changes. 

4.2 CroSS-Cutting iSSueS

the following discussion briefly touches on the 
issues common to many climate change impacts, 
highlighting focus areas for adaptation planning. 

4.2.1 infraStruCture

infrastructure assets provide a significant oppor- 
tunity for adaptation. they have long operational  
lifetimes, meaning they will be exposed to both 
current and future climate. infrastructure in Canada  
is relatively vulnerable to climate change as it  
is aging and over-used with population and 
development pressures increasing associated 
expectations for service. 
Weathering of infrastructure can occur via biological 
 (mould), chemical (corrosion), thermal (freeze-
thaw) or mechanical agents (wind-driven rain); 
all of which will be affected by climate change. 
damage to infrastructure from extreme weather 
 events tends to increase dramatically above  
critical thresholds. environment Canada reported  
that a 25% increase in peak wind gust can generate  
a 650% increase in building damage claims.18

Aside from direct changes to weather conditions, 
climate change will also affect patterns of supply 
and consumer demand. For example, higher 
summer temperatures may increase demand for 
transportation to beaches and mountains, while 
increased severe weather may affect supply 
chains and resources that infrastructure and  
repair companies rely on. 
Maladapted infrastructure will have indirect  
impacts in the way of asset management costs,  
insurance claims and negative effects on reputation. 
 A Vancouver rainstorm in 2010 resulted in 173 
filed claims with the City and a 2005 rainstorm 
in toronto ranks as the second largest insurance 
payout in Canadian history. An ontario-specific 
study predicted the following increases in insured 
losses due to rainfall related water damage: 13%, 
20% and 30% for the 2020s, 2050s and 2080s 
respectively.19

While changes to water quality are generally a concern in other jurisdictions, 
the new Seymour-Capilano filtration plan has the capacity to deal with  
increased source temperature and turbidity. 
it is well established that the urban poor are particularly vulnerable to cli-
mate change and natural hazards due to where they live within cities with 
respect to both location and quality of housing, and the lack of reliable basic 
services.20 Children, the elderly, and those with existing health conditions are 
also likely to be more vulnerable to health impacts. 
Although heat stress may appear less threatening in BC compared to the 
rest of the country, much of the BC population is less acclimatized to  
temperatures above 30 °C. non-respiratory emergency room visits in Van-
couver currently increase with high summer temperatures and are expected 
to rise further with an aging population. 
Airborne pollutants cause wheezing, asthma attacks and impaired lung 
function, and are associated with increased respiratory illness, stroke, and 
heart attack.21 the national roundtable on the environment and the econo-
my reported that poorer air quality resulting from higher temperatures will 
lead to more hospital visits and millions of dollars in costs to local health 
care systems for Canada’s four major cities – toronto, Montreal, Vancouver 
and Calgary.

4.2.4 eConomy

Climate change can be thought of as a pervasive economic shock that will 
potentially affect all sectors of the economy.22 Both goods movement and 
local business are likely to be affected by climate change and associated sea 
level rise with the potential to compromise Vancouver’s and the province’s 
economy. it is important to consider the economic advantages climate 
change may provide as well. Warmer summers may attract more tourists 
and longer growing seasons allow for new agriculture crops in the region. 
the national round table on the environment and the economy (nrtee) 
found that world-wide greenhouse gas emissions and subsequent climate 
change impacts could, in turn, have an economic impact on Canada of  
$5 billion annually by 2020 and between $21 and $43 billion annually by 2050.  
Specific to BC by the 2050s, timber supply impacts could range from $2 billion 
to $17 billion annually and flooding damages to coastal dwellings could cost 
between $1 billion to $8 billion per year. the report concluded that ignoring 
climate change now will cost us more in the long run and that adaptation is 
a cost-effective way to alleviate many of the impacts of climate change.23  
An international cost benefit study echoed the nrtee findings, reporting that 
between 40% and 68% of the loss in gdp expected to 2030 (under severe 
climate change scenarios) could be averted through adaptation measures 
for which economic benefits outweigh their costs.24

the preservation and expansion of trees and greenspaces in Vancouver 
contributes to both climate change mitigation and adaptation. Vegetation 
absorbs carbon, helps keep the city cooler in the summer and increases the 
amount of groundwater recharge, thereby lowering flood risk. 
Urban structures such as asphalt and buildings absorb more solar energy  
than grass and trees increasing the local temperature – a phenomenon known  
as the urban heat island effect. Vegetation in the downtown helps decrease this 
effect, providing a safer environment health wise and lowering the need for 
air conditioning. Models have shown areas like airports with a high proportion 
of pavement can be almost 9°C warmer than areas with heavy vegetation 
cover such as parks.
parks and greenspace can also play an important role in decreasing the impacts  
or occurrence of flooding from heavy rainfall or storm surge. parks can be 
used for detention and infiltration of stormwater or as containment areas  
for heavy storm surge. 
Beyond the number of trees and greenspaces in the City, the health of the 
urban ecosystems is paramount. Climate change is predicted to exacerbate 
undesirable agents of rapid change such as invasive pests or indigenous pests 
which are opportunistic to new environmental stress. Monitoring is essential 
to ward off major problems before they exceed our ability to control them. 
Habitats found within the urban landscapes are often characterized as 
habitat islands within a sea or buildings. Climate change will exacerbate the 
implications of habitat isolation necessitating a renewed effort to increase 
habitat connectivity. 
the Stanley park Management plan includes considerations for climate change  
such as ‘wind-proofing’, appropriate site selection/ planting practices, species 
selection and pest monitoring. these considerations will need to be applied 
to other urban greenspaces and trees including development landscape plans,  
street trees and trees on private property.

traditionally, risk has been dealt with through  
insurance. the insurance Bureau of Canada recently 
observed that the number and severity of storms 
is having a negative effect on the industry. they 
reported that, while historically most insurance 
claims were related to fire and theft, half of every 
dollar now paid out by insurance companies is for  
water damage related to extreme weather events.25  
insurance costs may rise and become difficult to 
obtain in risk areas or following repeat events. 
Community risks are business risks as they depend  
on local services and infrastructure to run their  
businesses. Businesses are already on the frontline  
of climate change with bottom lines increasingly 
at risk due to weather and climate phenomena. 
impacts to businesses from climate change can 
be categorized into physical and operational  
impacts such as decreased availability or increased  
price of critical materials; regulatory and legal 
risks such as new land use zoning or building 
changes; financing risks such as access to capital  
for businesses at high risk to climate change; 
market changes; and reputational risks.26 it will  
be imperative for businesses to demonstrate  
a commitment to adaptation, raise awareness 
and collaborate through new forms of public- 
private partnerships to tackle the most complex 
challenges of adaptation.27 

4.2.5 CoaStal Zone

thirty eight percent of the Canadian population lives  
within 20km of a coast or great lake shoreline.28 
Coastal areas are exceptionally vulnerable to sea 
level rise given that they are home to concentrated  
populations, economic centres and valuable eco-
systems. Coastal industry remains integral to the 
transportation and transfer of goods. 
A 2008 oeCd report ranked Vancouver 15th out 
of 136 large port cities in terms of the value of 
assets exposed to sea level rise.29 BtA Works, the 
research arm of a local architecture firm, found 
that industrial lands, historic areas and the public 
realm would be affected disproportionally in a 
5m sea level rise scenario. Conversion of these 
industrial lands to residential areas is likely to  
increase the consequences of a flood. the national  
round table on the environment and the economy  
predicted sea level rise to cause between $2.1 billion  
and $7.6 billion in damages by 2050 for BC  
(primarily Metro Vancouver) based on a sea level 
rise of 0.28m to 0.85m by 2100. they estimate 
that $25 billion worth of real estate (not including 

City infrastructure) would be heavily impacted with 
the cost of sufficient protective measures such as 
earth dikes or seawalls estimated to range from 
$255 million to $510 million (2011 dollars).
recognized adaptation responses to sea level rise  
can be grouped into four broad categories as 
follows:
•   Protect: protect the coastline through structural  

mechanisms such as dikes and seawalls.

•   accommodate: increase flood construction 
levels, add covenants for liability reduction  
and retrofit existing buildings.

•   Planned retreat: withdraw, relocate or abandon  

private or public assets due to coastal hazard.

•   avoid: identify future ‘no build’ zones or use land  
acquisition or restriction tools such as land trusts. 

the United Kingdom is a leader in coastal flood 
risk management. planning follows three broad 
steps: preliminary flood risk assessment; flood 
hazard mapping; and adoption of a flood risk 
management plan aimed at prevention, protection  
and preparedness.

aCtionS

ThE aCTiON ChaPTEr is organized by anticipated  
climate change or direct impact (sea level rise).  
A suite of adaptation actions are identified for 
each section, ranging from low cost and easy 
to implement, to larger, more complex projects. 
response strategies identified as primary actions 
represent the key projects that will help the city 
adapt to climate change. Supporting actions 
represent application of an adaptation lens to 
existing actions or generally lower cost/smaller  
scope activities. Where there are no primary  
actions to address a climate change, only a  
suite of supporting actions are introduced. 
primary actions, supporting actions and more 
detailed actions are listed with accountability  
and timing information in a comprehensive  
Adaptation Action Matrix found in Appendix A. 
the matrix is organized by impacts under the 
same section headings as the chapter below. 
no-regret actions are the focus – those that 
build on existing plans and actions and provide 
community benefits regardless of the extent of 
climate change experienced. each objective is  
achieved through a combination of different  
actions which act together. these portfolios  
of actions generally include measures from  
the following four categories: 
•   modifying policies, plans, procedures, standards  

(e.g. by-laws, development plans, operating 
practices, codes); 

•  building new or upgrading infrastructure; 
•   improving community awareness and  

education; and

•   varying/diversifying existing actions (e.g. diver-
sifying energy supplies, diversifying plantings).

the actions in the Strategy largely focus on areas 
where the City can take independent action. to this 
end we completed an early scan of suggested 
adaptation actions to ascertain whether they  
fell within the City’s jurisdiction/responsibility or 
not. Some actions signal necessary collaboration 
with the regional and provincial governments, 
and it is recognized that local adaptation is 
reliant on close ties and joint actions with other 
levels of government, neighbours, the private 
sector and community groups. Staff will continue 
to collaborate on projects and push for regional 
coordination on adaptation issues.

what this could mean: on September 19th, 2010 
Vancouver’s heavy rainfall resulted in 173 filed claims 
against the City and 23 other reports of flooding 
related incidents from citizens. the second most 
expensive national natural disaster was toronto’s 
2005 downpour with damages exceeding $500 
million.30 rainfall related water damage losses are 
expected to continue increasing (20% by 2050 
in eastern Canada) as is the volume of untreated 
wastewater entering waterbodies via combined 
sewer overflows (CSo). these climate change 
impacts have far-reaching social, environmental 
and economic implications.

the City will take advantage of the following  
opportunities to reduce rainfall related risks:
•   decreasing the proportion of stormwater entering  
the sewer infrastructure through application of 
stormwater management techniques.

•   increasing the capacity of the storm sewer 

through sewer separation.

•   Accounting for climate change in system design.

1.1.1 Primary aCtion: ComPlete anD  
imPlement a CitywiDe integrateD  
Stormwater management Plan 

Applying stormwater management techniques 
where possible can reduce peak discharges and 
generally reduce the flow loading on storm sewer 
infrastructure, thereby increasing resilience to heavier 
and more frequent storm events. Stormwater 
management approaches are categorized into:
•   planning and design approaches such as limits 

to impermeable surfaces;

•   runoff storage and conveyance such as using 

pocket parks for street runoff, re-routing  
stormwater to waterbodies, or non-potable 
water storage/use; and

•   infiltration and detention practices such as green  

roofs, street infiltration bulges or downspout 
rock pits.

Stormwater management techniques often include  
green infrastructure (bioswales, green roofs, rain  
barrels) which provide a host of co-benefits with  
other City goals. For example, green roofs reduce 

19

energy and keep cities cooler, reducing CSos 
means less pathogens enter the waterways,  
and recycling stormwater contributes to water 
conservation goals. the City is mandated through 
the Liquid Waste Management plan to complete 
an integrated Stormwater Management plan (iSMp)  
for all watersheds in the City by the end of 2014. 
the Citywide, cross-departmental iSMp will address  
options for stormwater (rainfall) management on 
both public and private property. the iSMp will 
recommend changes to policy, design practices, 
standards and bylaws to facilitate implementation.

1.1.2 Primary aCtion: SeParate the Sanitary 
anD Stormwater SewerS (in ProgreSS)

Separating the sanitary and stormwater sewers  
substantially mitigates the risk of CSos and 
private property sewer back-ups. Separating the 
systems also provides more capacity in the storm 
sewer for handling anticipated increases in heavy 
rainfall volumes.
the City is legislated to complete system separation  
by 2050. Currently, high risk areas, or areas where  
residents have experienced more frequent sewer 
backups, are targeted for priority separation. 
Separation of private side connections is not 
mandated and will require a closer look to ensure 
the added resilience of separated pipes is not 
negated at the property line.
Supporting actions: 
•   explore options for increasing replacement of 
private side combined sewer connections with 
separated connections in advance of City-side 
separation. 

•   prepare runoff control guidelines for private 
property as required by Metro Vancouver in 
coming years. 

•   Add larger catch basins or increase number  

in critical locations.

•   evaluate and recommend opportunities for 
stormwater detention, infiltration or storage 
during park re-design and in new parks.

•   incorporate rainfall projections and new idF 

curves in sewer and street design.

•   increase public awareness of catch basin  

functionality and basement flooding mitigation. 

2.0 Sea leVel riSe 

impacts: increased flooding, storm surge damage,  
saltwater intrusion and erosion to the coastline. 
impacts to gravity drainage of low lying storm 
sewers and potential impacts to groundwater levels.
what this could mean: Climate change is imposing  
increasing threats along coasts, both from rising 
sea levels and increased intensity and frequency  
of storms. Based on present and expected increases  
in emissions in the near future, sea levels are  
expected to rise at accelerating rates into the 
next century. 
A local study used assessment values to estimate 
that $25 billion worth of real estate (not including 
City infrastructure) is at risk from sea level rise in 
Vancouver by the end of the century. industrial  
lands, historic areas and the public realm are 
affected disproportionately.31 the federal round 
table on the environment and the economy  
suggest the annual national costs of coastal 
flooding damage could be as high as $8 billion 
dollars in coming decades.

Sea level rise adaptation options include protecting our coastlines with defences,  
accommodating higher water levels by elevating infrastructure, avoiding 
flood prone areas by focusing development elsewhere, and retreating via 
land acquisition etc. Choosing among options is a complex task that starts 
with a clear risk assessment detailing the magnitude and frequency of coastal  
flooding, identifying vulnerabilities and quantifying potential damages and 
losses. the City endeavours to find solutions that minimize the financial,  
social and environmental impacts of future flooding while ensuring near-shore 
amenities, access, views and other benefits are maintained. A city-wide 
sea level adaptation response will provide high-level direction to navigate 
through the complex issues and make civic investments without creating 
undue hardships in the short term. 
While the risk assessment is being completed, the City’s interim flood  
construction levels need to be revised, and associated Flood-proofing policies 
amended to provide certainty. policies will be revisited and updated upon 
completion of the City-wide sea level rise response strategy. 

2.1.1 Primary aCtion: ComPlete a CoaStal flooD riSk aSSeSSment

Strategic planning for sea level rise is complex given the uncertainty asso-
ciated with the rate of water level rise and changes in storm frequency, the 
environmental and financial implications of engineering solutions, and the 
long timeline for fundraising and implementing such unique capital projects. 
it took 30 years for the United Kingdom and the netherlands to add new 
storm protection after a disastrous coastal storm in 1953. While we are not 
expecting observable impacts from sea level rise for some time, we need 
to start thinking about options now. A comprehensive risk assessment is a 
recognized best practice and first step toward planning actions to mitigate 
the risks posed by sea level rise.
Continuing to coordinate with other municipalities regionally, with other 
levels of government, and with partners such as port MetroVancouver will 
be integral to maintaining the economic vibrancy of the region. 

the flood risk assessment will include the following general phases of work:
•  Phase 1: Flood hazard mapping/modeling
•  Phase 2: Vulnerability Assessment
•  Phase 3: Consequence Analysis
•   Phase 4: risk Management options/trade-off Analysis
risk assessment outputs will support development of a city-wide sea level 
rise adaptation response that will address new infrastructure needs, erosion 
protection considerations, land use regulation changes and plans for ameni-
ties such as beaches and the seawall.

While numerous municipalities in the lower mainland maintain many kilometers 
of dikes, the City of Vancouver has relied on other tools such as flood  
construction levels (FCLs) and setbacks. City flood-proofing policies establish 
these elevations and setbacks by flood prone area. the last amendment  
to the policies in 2007 flagged the need for future updates to incorporate 
new sea level rise information. 
the BC Ministry of environment released new guidelines outlining incorporation  
of sea level rise into FCL calculations in May, 2011. the City encouraged an  
interim increase of 1m to existing FCLs while undertaking a study to apply  
guideline methodology to specific coastline types. Amending the flood-proofing 
policies will increase the flood resilience of new development and maintain 
the potential for a range of adaptation solutions in the future. increasing the 
awareness of builders and developers with respect to flood-proofing methods 
and considerations will be an important complement to policy amendment. 
Supporting actions:
•   Continue to coordinate with other regional municipalities and other levels 
of government to ensure a regional approach to coastal flood management. 
•   Leverage opportunities to evaluate strategic near-shore open space planning 

for inundation and containment areas and saltwater resilient plantings. 

•   initiate a flood-proofing awareness campaign among builders and developers.
•   Monitor low-lying storm sewer capacity and functionality and continue  

to add back-up power and storage tanks to existing stormwater pumps.
•   Monitor groundwater for increasing levels. Consider associated impacts  

in coastal development design. 

impacts: increased public safety and health risks; increased resources required  
to respond and recover following events. 
what this could mean: in addition to earthquakes, the top hazards identified 
by emergency manage-ment in 2009 are weather related events, namely 
wind storms, blizzards, freezing rain/ice storms and rainstorms. the 2006 
Vancouver windstorm cost the City approximately $10 million in forest resto-
ration, repairs, slope stabilization and planning. Following the August 2005 
rainstorm in toronto, the City spent over $40 million to bring the City’s  
infrastructure back into service. Storms can be bothersome to many in terms 
of service disruptions but can be lethal to vulnerable populations including 
the sick, elderly, young, homeless and low-income community members. 
enhancing resilience now will be cost effective in terms of damages avoided 
in the long term. 
Many of the actions in this chapter and the action matrix (Appendix A) help 
build resilience to extreme events. the following actions focus on safety and 
health risks to vulnerable populations and response and recovery capacity.

the City’s emergency management and response capacity will need to cater 
to more frequent, simultaneous and extreme disasters. this includes dealing 
with their cascading effects such as power outages and road closures. Many 
existing emergency management and response practices at the City can be 
expanded to cover extreme weather events. it will also be important to continue 
monitoring resources including staff, their training and equipment, and City 
contingency and insurance budgets to ensure they are evolving to meet new 
and possibly escalating needs. 

3.2.1 Primary aCtion: DeVeloP a PoliCy for BaCk-uP Power  
anD aSSeSS DePartmentS for  ShortfallS

A key cascading effect of stormy weather is power outages which may in turn  
cause health impacts and service/business disruption. At the peak of the 2006 
windstorm, BC Hydro reported that over 250,000 customers were without power. 

22

City infrastructure and facilities are often crucial during extreme event 
response such as community centres providing relief, fire halls, the works 
yards, traffic signals and some street lighting. other City facilities and  
infrastructure may require back-up power to maintain basic services  
(such as stormwater sewer pumps). 
one litre of generator diesel provides about 3 to 3.5 Kilowatt hours of power. 
to retain basic function in a community centre for one hour would therefore 
require 30 to 50L of fuel. increased severe weather may also affect fuel  
supply chains and resources that infrastructure and repair companies rely on. 
identifying where investment in back-up power is integral to public safety, 
storm response and recovery will build City resilience to extreme events.  
A comprehensive look at backup power for public buildings and infrastructure 
includes determining best methods of meeting the power needs and ensuring 
fuel supply during storms.
the following steps for policy development are recommended:
•   identify and prioritize buildings and infrastructure for back-up power over 

and above life safety requirements.

•   Compare the costs and benefits of mobile generators versus generators 

built into facilities.

•   plan for fuel supply and emergency fuel movement from both outside 

providers and city sources. 

Supporting actions:
•   Continue adding back-up power to key traffic signals
•   Complete planning for response to windstorms, rainstorms and flooding.
•   Activate plans and the eoC when events are forecast or occur. 
•   Consider continuity of supply of key response resources such as plywood. 
•   Support the events risk Assessment task Force in ensuring events in the 

City are safe and resilient to inclement weather. 

•   Broaden ‘team Vancouver emergency response’ volunteer urban search 
and rescue to aid with extreme event response such as park patrol during 
heat waves.

Added shelter capacity exists now in the form of extreme weather response 
shelters that operate when specific, provincially mandated criteria are met. 
these criteria and the associated funding need to be expanded to keep up 
with the increase in frequency and intensity of extreme weather. the local 
low-income population is generally more vulnerable to extreme weather 
given their housing conditions, limited mobility, and lack of insurance and 
savings. Health risks from mould and inclement weather are priorities within 
this section while heat related risks are detailed in section 4 below. 
Supporting actions:
•   engage with Metro Vancouver to request at the regional level that the 

extreme weather shelter criteria and funding be expanded. 

•   partner with VCH to initiate an education campaign on mould; how to 

identify and address it. 

•   ensure instances of mould are included in the new online rental database.

the City’s extreme Hot Weather Committee completed phase i of planning 
in 2011, including development of a heat alert and a ‘Be Cool’ communication 
campaign. the second phase of work is focused on actions to minimize  
impacts of heat on health, especially within vulnerable populations. Leveraging  
and adding support to the existing work program will ensure Vancouver 
matches the efforts of other Canadian cities in planning for heat. 
the following are some of the short and midterm actions and tasks under 
the extreme hot weather preparedness work program:
•   increase resources to support an expanded program including additional 

staff time from Sustainability. 

•   Complete urban heat island effect mapping. Coordinate with parks on 

targeting green space and trees in hot areas.

•   Work with the Coastal Communities at risk research group on vulnerable 

population mapping. 

•   develop policies for cool refuges and cooling capacity in civic facilities. 

Assess cooling capacity of facilities within identified hot spots and prioritize 
for early policy implementation. 

•   research and explore options for transporting those in need to cool facilities 

during heat events. 

4.0 hotter, Drier SummerS 

impacts: water supply shortages in late summer, increasing respiratory illness, 
health and safety risks for vulnerable populations.
what this could mean: during extreme heat events, health risks from direct 
impacts such as heat stroke increase, and many people with underlying health 
conditions will experience a worsening of their condition. the heat wave 
in 2009 in Vancouver caused an estimated 122 ‘excess deaths’ and many 
emergency room visits. Vancouverites are generally less acclimatized to 
high temperatures and therefore have a lower threshold for health effects. 
Vulnerable populations such as older adults, infants and children, those with 
chronic illness and socially disadvantaged communities are also at higher risk. 
the north Shore snowpack has decreased by over 20% in the last fifty years 
and is predicted to be almost non-existent by the year 2080. An increase in 
annual rainfall will help offset the decrease in source water for our drinking 
reservoirs but longer, drier summers may result in late summer water supply 
pressure. 

24

•   explore the potential for cooling rooms in non-market housing
•   Continue to expand public access to drinking water (gCAp).

5.0 oVerall ChangeS 

impacts: Maladapted buildings; decrease in durability and lifecycle of  
infrastructure; increase in impacts to urban forests, green spaces and trees; 
changing pests, vectors for disease and air quality.
what this could mean: the combination of more frequent extreme events 
and increases in annual temperature and precipitation will have impacts on 
both the built and natural environment. 
there is a significant opportunity to improve future  
resilience of infrastructure by incorporating climate change information 
into design today. environment Canada states that within the timeframe of 
climate change impacts being felt, new building will account for an equal or 
greater fraction of the building stock (assuming a 1-1.5% replacement rate). 
Buildings may be maladapted to hotter temperatures, susceptible to damage 
during extreme weather and encounter new durability challenges. the Urban 
Heat island effect (UHie) refers to urban areas being significantly warmer than  
their surrounding areas due to more heat retentive materials, surface heat  
radiation being blocked by buildings and lack of evapotranspiration (through  
lack of vegetation). the Urban heat island will worsen as temperatures 
climb. damage to buildings from extreme weather events tends to increase 
dramatically above critical threshold (e.g. 25% increase in peak wind gust 
can generate 650% increase in building claims). 
trees, parks and greenspaces provide innumerable co-benefits such as climate 
change mitigation through carbon uptake, shade provision, moderation of 
surface flooding, habitat and outdoor amenities. ensuring trees reach the size 
and vigour required to start providing these benefits is essential and may be 
challenged by added climate change stressors such as drought, higher peak 
winds and new pests and invasive species.

(VBBl) uPDate anD exPlore aSSoCiateD Zoning ChangeS. 

the building bylaw includes climate related design loads based on historical 
observation as well as numerous measures to ensure weather resilience in 
our wet Vancouver climate. Looking ahead to heavier rain events, more wind 
and hotter summers will require consideration of new building measures to 
ensure continued resilience. 
Buildings may be maladapted to hotter temperatures, susceptible to damage 
during extreme weather and encounter new durability challenges. the Urban 
Heat island effect whereby highly urbanized areas experience higher tempera-
tures will exacerbate summer cooling loads. envelope integrity may also be 
adversely affected by increasing wind and rain loads and higher ambient 
moisture levels.
recent Canadian adaptation reports call for action by the Federal and provincial  
governments in collaboration with the insurance industry to research design 
practices that are cost effective and promote climate adaptation. Building 
durability and disaster resilience are suggested as themes for upcoming 
building code renewals. Ahead of national and provincial action, there are 
several opportunities to partner on adaptation incorporation in the next VBBL.  
the institute for Catastrophic Loss reduction has recently worked with ontario 
builders to recommend code modifications for a changing climate and are 
eager to repeat their process elsewhere. More data is required on localized 
parameters related to design loads such as wind uplift pressure. the pacific 
Climate impacts Consortium at the University of Victoria are eager to continue 
our existing collaboration. 
the following are adaptation measures to be evaluated and/or incorporated 
into the building bylaw:
•  Use of reflective surfaces
•   Buildings are better equipped to manage heat gain (passive guidelines)
•   development in fire interface areas (near parks and woodlands)

25

•  Construction safety (high winds)
•   Continue to lobby homeowners protection office for broader acceptance 

of green roofs. 

•   overflow mechanisms in roof design with route plan for flood water and/

or oversize roof drainage system.

•   emergency management plans/evacuation plans for buildings;   

combine flood hazard with seismic. 

•   gray water use and rainwater capture for toilet flushing and garden use.
Supporting actions:
•   incorporate climate change as an asset management and infrastructure 

design consideration.

•   Collaborate with Cascadia region Urban Sustainability directors network 

to investigate asset management approaches to planning for climate 
change.

•   Continue to collaborate with Metro Vancouver on updated intensity  

duration Frequency (idF) curves. 

•   identify training and implementation opportunities within engineering 

with the public infrastructure engineering Vulnerability Committee

public and private trees were a focus of the access to nature goal in the 
greenest city plan given the vast array of benefits they provide. growing 
healthy, long lasting trees requires consideration of the future climate as  
well as appropriate siting, planting and maintenance. 
trees contribute to adaptation by:
•   intercepting and filtering stormwater runoff to prevent flooding and  

improve water quality

•   Absorbing pollutants to clean the air
•   providing wind-breaks to protect buildings from damage
•   regulating urban heat island effects through shading and evaporation

26

Some co-benefits with other goals include:
•   Lower cooling demand for electricity
•  directly sequester carbon
•  Wildlife habitat 
•  increased property value and liveability

5.2.1 Primary aCtion: SuPPort DeVeloPment of a ComPrehenSiVe 
urBan foreSt management Plan that foCuSeS on growing 
SuCCeSSful treeS in urBan areaS. 

through the greenest City Action plan we have committed to planting 
150,000 trees. An Urban Forest Management plan will identify the issues 
and values most important to the community and provides a roadmap for 
investing in and maintaining our urban forest to 2020 and beyond. it will  

ensure that species selected and locations for planting targeted, maximize 
civic investment and ensure longevity. it will explicitly address climate 
change impacts to trees and greenspaces as well as ensuring we take full 
advantage of their potential to support City adaptation. 
A multi-department process led by arboriculture and park professionals is 
needed. the Forest Management plan should gather baseline data and provide 
direction on development of standards and guidelines that address: 
•   preparing for challenges facing our urban forest in the 21st century including  

a changing climate. 

•   increasing canopy cover citywide as a measure to help mitigate climate 

change. Map canopy coverage with land use, identify tree deficient areas 
and work to add tree space and appropriate soils management to remedy 
the deficit.

Climate change is an overarching issue that poses an additional risk or benefit  
to the way we do business. Successful adaptation will require moving beyond 
this strategy to incorporation of climate change in risk management and 
project planning across departments. 
regular updates to climate science will be shared throughout the organization 
for consideration in design and planning. Mapping flood hazard, urban heat 
island effect, tree canopy, landslide risk areas etc. provides a powerful baseline  
of information. Seattle and toronto have both developed and applied software  
programs to support mainstreaming climate change that can be evaluated 
for potential use in Vancouver. Collaborating with municipalities and other 
partners regionally will ensure we support regional resilience and continued 
economic vibrancy. 
Supporting actions: 
•   Continue to collaborate regionally with First nations, Metro Vancouver 

and other municipalities.

•   investigate best practices in ‘mainstreaming’ adaptation. Consider both 

internal software programs and external communication/checklists.

•   develop an Urban Forest operations program (Maintenance standards 

•   Complete mapping to support climate change adaptation with co-benefits 

and budgets).

for other applications.

Supporting actions: 
•   promote public awareness of the critical role of urban forests in coping 

•   Complete a communication strategy, including community engagement, 

for Climate Change Adaptation, especially sea level rise. 

with climate change. 

 

•   Continue pest and invasive species monitoring programs with climate 

change as an added stressor. 

•   establish funding levels adequate enough to reinstitute systematic pruning. 
•   ensure species and location selection criteria in the gCAp planting strategy,  

landscape guidelines and in the replacement tree list in the protection of

urban forest management Plan: Long living,  
vigorous trees are necessary to pay back the  
cost of getting them to a size at which they 
start to provide significant benefits in terms of 
carbon uptake, infiltration, shade provision and 
water diversion. to grow successful trees in urban 
areas demands proper soil management, species 
selection, location and maintenance. Climate 
change intensifies the need for high standards of 
tree management and the incorporation of future 
climate considerations. 
Vancouver Building By-law update 2017: Working 
with the building and academic community to 
explore best methods for incorporating changing 
climate loads into the building code will support 
a more resilient building stock in the coming 
decades. 
Sewer Separation Strategy: Separating the storm  
and sanitary sewers will reduce the risk of combined 
sewer overflows and private side sewer back-ups. 
the existing approach of prioritizing high risk areas 
for early separation ensures resilience ahead of 
significant shifts in storm profiles. 
extreme hot weather Committee: the committee, 
in partnership with Vancouver Coastal Health 
developed a heat alert and Be Cool campaign  
in phase i of planning. phase ii of the project can 
be expanded to explore and implement many 
of the best practices and programs for heat that 
are being pursued by municipalities across north 
America.

6.1 imPlementation

ThE DEParTmENTS aND divisions identified as  
accountable for actions in the Strategy will be  
responsible for implementation. the Sustainability 
group will provide coordination among depart-
ments, deliver on specific actions and support 
departments in their implementation of actions. 
Where significant new actions are proposed,  
the need for an implementation plan and timeline 
will be evaluated. 

imPlementation through exiSting 
ProgramS anD Planning

the effectiveness of Strategy implementation  
is dependent on incorporation of outlined  
actions into existing plans, policies and programs. 
Key vehicles for adaptation incorporation are  
the following:
greenest City action Plan: Many of the actions 
promoted for sustainability of the City have 
co-benefits with climate change adaptation.  
Adaptation provides either an added driver, as 
with water conservation, or an added consideration 
as is the case with the tree planting strategies. 
integrated Stormwater management Plan:  
improved management of stormwater will ensure 
continued functioning of the sewer system under 
heavier storm conditions. Vancouver has significant 
opportunities to enhance innovative management  
approaches from impervious surface policies to 
street design. the integrated Stormwater Manage- 
ment plan will provide cross-departmental 
recommendations to take advantage of these 
opportunities. 

28

6.2  methoD anD SCheDule for  

uPDating the Plan 

our global and local understanding of climate 
change and its impacts, costs and potential 
actions continues to evolve. Modeled projections 
continue to become increasingly sophisticated  
and inputs change providing new ranges of  
anticipated temperature, precipitation etc.  
the City of Vancouver intends to review and  
evaluate the Strategy annually and to update it 
every five years from the date of initial Strategy 
adoption. this cycle may be accelerated to less 
than five years based on the following triggers:
•   A significant climate change impact is experi-

enced; and, or

•   Senior government action or policy triggers  
the need to respond (e.g. as with provincial  
Sea Level rise guidelines).

annual evaluation:
Climate programs staff in the Sustainability group 
will be responsible for evaluating the Strategy and 
staying current with climate science. Sustainability  
staff will also participate in regional and provincial  
adaptation forums and partner with external 
stakeholders to pool resources and ensure  
adaptation across sectors and jurisdictions. 
the annual review and subsequent progress  
report will include:
•   Summary of any observed changes in climate 

or impacts that occurred;

•  review of successful actions implemented;
•   review barriers and amend actions to enable 

successful implementation;

•   re-evaluation of timelines as information on 

impacts and funding is updated;

•   review of other planning programs or initiatives  
that provide a window of opportunity for climate 
adaptation actions or that may be impacted by 
climate change; and

•  identification of potential new funding options. 

5-year update: 
it is not the intent of the update process to develop  
a new plan. the update will be guided by the 
elements below:
•   the update process will be carried out by a 

Climate Change Adaptation team appointed  
by the deputy City Manager and coordinated  
by Sustainability group staff. At least one 
member of the original Strategy development 
team should be included.

•   the most recent regional information on climate  
science will be a key input to the planning process. 

•   A scan of impacts identified and prioritized 
in the original plan will be analysed for gaps 
arising from new climate science or observed 
impacts. new actions to mitigate these impacts 
will be detailed. 

•   existing action timelines will be reviewed to 
ensure thresholds have not been surpassed  
triggering an acceleration of action  
implementation.

•   All actions will be reviewed and revised to 
account for actions completed, dropped or 
changed and to account for changes in risk  
or to leverage new programs, policies or plans. 

•   inserting indicators to measure adaptation 

progress will be considered. 

•   the draft update will be reviewed by the  

appropriate departments prior to a final plan 
update being presented to Council for adoption.

development review/public realm planning; organizational changes that  
will facilitate improved integration of trees into urban design; plant/tree  
hardiness; and prevention and management techniques for invasive  
species and pests

Map canopy cover and identify tree deficit and greenspace deficit areas.  
initiate a program to address these areas through development and planning. 
ensure species and location selection criteria for the planting Strategies  
developed under the gCAp consider the best available climate projections  
and any information or mapping related to Urban Heat island effect. 

re-evaluate zero based budget for street and park tree maintenance in urban 
forest management plan.
review replacement tree list in protection of tree Bylaw and the Water Wise 
Landscape guidelines plant list to ensure all species are resilient to climate 
projections. 
Apply wind management techniques used in Stanley park in other locations 
such as Jericho park and the renfrew ravine. 
record failures in street tree inventory comments section and learn from  
climate related trends.

explore and evaluate options for the storage and reuse of winter rainwater for 
summer irrigation. Use Van dusen gardens as pilot/education opportunity. 
increase artificial turf use

return PerioDS

the return periods correspond to the maximum or minimum events so rare that they are expected to occur only once every 5, 10, or 25 years on average. 
these may also be interpreted as the events with a 20%, 10%, and 4% chance of occurring each year, respectively. the following changes show the projected 
change in return periods expressed as a ratio of frequency of occurrence in the past. For example, an average ratio of 2 for a 25 year return period would 
mean that we expect an event that only occurred once every 25 years in the past is expected to occur twice as frequently by 2050.

aDaPTaTiON ChallENGES aND rESPONSES

Knowledge about future climate – particularly local impacts of global climate change trends – is incomplete. given the timelines for planning and implementing 
change, and the understanding that being proactive will yield benefits and alleviate future costs, decision makers will have no option but to make policy and 
investment choices under uncertainty. the following are examples of some of the adaptation planning challenges and recognized options for responding to them.

Challenge
uncertainty: there are various sources of uncertainty in the information we rely on 
to plan for climate change including:

- the uncertainty introduced as models attempt to model natural processes

- unknown socio-economic changes that will influence our vulnerability through time.

- how future impacts will relate to each other and compound each other. 
Data availability: data inputs traditionally used for planning at the municipal scale 
may not be available

- gaps in knowledge at the scale of precise local impacts

- models work best with long-term trends over large areas.
timelines: decision ‘lifetimes’ interact with the nature and timing of the climate change 
variable to which the decision is sensitive. For example, a new building has a short 
lead-time in terms of design and permitting but long consequences meaning it will 
experience a significant degree of climate change. 
Choosing actions: When choosing between adaptation investments decision-makers 
face a bewildering array of potential adaptation measures, each with its own costs 
and benefits, often requiring phased implementation. traditional business case 
templates may not apply. 

tools/responses
low regret actions: Measures that provide benefits under current climate and a range 
of future climate change scenarios. Many of these low-regrets strategies produce 
co-benefits, in that they address other City goals such as mitigation, sustainability, 
human well-being etc.
robust decision making approaches: identify decisions that are robust across the 
range of future possibilities, even if they are not precisely optimal for any and may  
be more costly to implement. 
flexible Design: Build for conditions now or for the next few decades but ensure  
designs show cost effective modifications for future conditions. 
flexible decision pathways: identify a wide range of options suitable for different 
extents of change over timeframes. recognize that we may require an incremental 
approach for pragmatic reasons (interaction with existing infrastructure) with the 
opportunity to learn and re-orient as the future unfolds. 
nested decisions: incremental and short term decisions will need to be embedded 
within longer-term plans with key decision points or signposts identified for  
reappraisal over time.
adaptive management: Adaptation efforts benefit form an iterative or adaptive  
management approach due to the complexity, uncertainties and long time frame  
associated with climate change.
Scenario Planning: Combinations of structured decision-making with scenario planning 
for different future socio-economic and climate realities can prove useful for strategic 
decision-making.
Vulnerability and risk assessments: Assessments help prioritize impacts.
risk management approaches: traditional risk management approaches from the 
natural hazard field provide frameworks for action synthesis.

A recent global survey on urban adaptation challenges found the following trend.
“in general, cities throughout the world report that they are having difficulty obtaining financial resources, allocating staff time, communicating the nature  
of the program, generating interest among political officials and business, mainstreaming, and gaining the commitment of local elected officials and government 
departments. two additional global trends are that most cities believe their national governments have limited understanding of the challenges they are facing, 
and most have limited access to financial support from local, regional, national, and international sources.” 33
