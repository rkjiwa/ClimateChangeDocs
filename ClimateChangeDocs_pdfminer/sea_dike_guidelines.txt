Introduction and Application of this Document 

General 
This document provides guidelines for the design of sea dikes to protect low lying lands that are 
exposed to coastal flood hazards arising from their exposure to the sea and to expected sea level 
rise due to climate change. 
This document will supersede the related sections of the existing “Dike Design and Construction 
Guide  2003”,  which  means  the  “Dike  Design  and  Construction  Guide  –  Best  Management 
Practices for British Columbia”, July 2003, published by the Province of British Columbia, Ministry 
of Water, Land and Air Protection (now the Ministry of Environment). 
This document provides guidelines intended to assist diking authorities, design professionals and 
others  in  fulfilling  dike  design  requirements  as  legislated  under  the  British  Columbia  Dike 
Maintenance Act.  This guideline document presents design standards relating to sea level rise and 
consequential  aspects  in  a  generalized  form  only.    Application  of  this  information  for  specific 
projects, which include new, repaired, upgraded or changed sea dikes, requires site specific design 
and  expert  advice.    This  guideline  document  does  not  specifically  address  geotechnical  design, 
structural design or construction standards, which may be indirectly affected by some aspects of 
sea level rise.  Qualified professionals with specialist engineering or environmental expertise must 
be involved and retained to design specific project components and to facilitate agency approvals. 
This  document,  and  the  companion  document  “Guidelines  for  Management  of  Coastal  Flood 
Hazard Land Use 2010”1 are specific to flood hazards arising from the exposure of BC lands to 
the  sea.  In  some  locations,  specifically  river  estuaries,  the  lands  will  also  be  exposed  to  other 
sources  of  flooding.  These  new  documents  are  companion  documents  to  the  existing  guideline 
documents  which  address  flooding  hazard  from  rivers2.    Analysis  of  flooding  hazard  from  all 
sources – rivers and the sea - will be required in estuaries.  
The Sea Level Rise projections and potential responses described in this document are drawn from 
the Policy Discussion Paper 20103.

Background  

Scope 
This guideline document describes the principles of determining the total water level and sea dike 
crest  elevations  for  sea  dikes,  as  legislated  under  the  British  Columbia  Dike  Maintenance  Act.  
Design will be performed at different levels of detail: 
-  Conceptual design 
-  Feasibility design 
-  Detailed design. 
This guideline is aimed at serving the conceptual design stage. 

Definitions 
A summary of definitions and terminology used in this document is provided in Appendix A. 
Where  possible  the  same  terminology  and  definitions  as  used  in  the  existing  documents;  Dike 
Design and Construction Guide 20032 and Land Use Guidelines 20044 are used; however, as 
the existing terminology and definitions sometimes need modification, clarification or expansion to 
be appropriate for coastal conditions, in some cases new or revised terminology and definitions are 
proposed.    It  is  recommended  that  the  reader  of  the  updated  documents  familiarize  themselves 
with the updated terminology and definitions in Appendix A as necessary. 

Reference Documents 
This Guideline document refers to several publications that are recognized as current examples of 
best  practice  for  the  design  of  coastal  engineering  structures,  including  sea  dikes.    Where  such 
reference  is  made  it  is  intended  to  refer  to  the  most  current  edition,  as  listed  below,  and  to  all 
amendments or updates published thereto.  It should be noted that a Building Code or Standard 
does not exist in Canada for coastal engineering structures. 
The  referenced  publications  and  Standards  listed  below  are  intended  to  provide  guidance  on 
internationally accepted best practice.  In some cases inter-comparison of documents will reveal 
several  approaches  may  apply.    In  these  situations;  theoretical  analysis,  evaluation  of  the 
approaches  for  application  to  the  specifics  of  British  Columbia  coastal  waters  and  recognized 
engineering practise should be used to select among alternative methods. 
Direct  measurement  of  specific  parameters,  over  appropriate  intervals  of  time,  may  also  be 
necessary or advisable. 
Detailed site or structure specific engineering investigations may also provide equivalent guidance 
for design.

Design Criteria 

General Requirements 
The primary function of a sea dike is to protect the people and assets behind the dike against the 
effects of flooding or inundation.  A sea dike is not intended to protect the shoreline or the adjacent 
seabed against erosion, although this may become a secondary aspect of the sea dike design, or 
the sea dike may be incorporated into a larger project with erosion protection, shoreline restoration 
or marine habitat preservation as concurrent objectives. 
Design criteria that are required but not specifically addressed in this guideline document include: 

-  The safety standard, design and service objectives to be achieved by the dike 
-  The design life of the dike 
- 

Inspection, maintenance and replacement or decommissioning of the dike. 

Guidance  regarding  these  design  criteria  is  provided  in  the  companion  document:  Policy 
Discussion Paper 20103. 

3.2 

Design Environment 

3.2.1  General 

This section describes the evaluation of physical environmental conditions that will be required to 
define the main functional or geometric aspects of a sea dike. 

3.2.2  Location of Facility (Reference elevation – depth of water) 

The water depths and terrestrial elevations at the location of a sea dike shall be determined from 
site-specific bathymetric and topographic surveys referenced to a common vertical and horizontal 
datum.    Where  bathymetric  and  topographic  surveys  are  undertaken  with  respect  to  a  separate 
datum, the relationship between the bathymetric datum and the topographic datum shall be defined 
over the entire project area. 
The  relationship  between  the  bathymetric  survey  datum,  the  topographic  survey  datum  and  the 
tidal datum for the area shall also be defined over the project area5. 

3.2.3  Sea Level Rise 

Global Climate Change Sea Level Rise 
Sea Level Rise is predicted to be moderate in the period from 2010 to 2025. However, the rate is 
predicted to increase more quickly in the period leading up to 2100, and then continue to increase 
steadily.  For the purpose of this document the current definition of the expected Sea Level Rise is 
provided  in  Figure  3-1.    The  basis  for  this  definition  is  provided  in  the  policy  document:  Policy 
Discussion Paper 20103. 
 

                                                      
5 In 2010 the vertical reference plane in Canada is in the process of being changed from a MSL related datum plane – 
technically known as CGVD28 – to a geoid based datum plan.  The update program is described at 
http://www.geod.nrcan.gc.ca/hm/index_e.php.  For the purpose of this document we use the term CGD to mean the 
datum as defined in 2010 and approximately equal to MSL.

Figure 3-1: Projections of Sea Level Rise 

source: Policy Discussion Paper (2010) 

 

 

Figure 3-1 illustrates the range of uncertainty in projections, showing a median projection, as well 
as a range in projections from low to high. The uncertainty increases into the future. As described  
in the policy document: Policy Discussion Paper 20103, it is recommended that sea dike design 
and assessment be based on the Recommended Curve for Sea Level Rise Policy in BC, shown on 
Figure 3-1. 
Unless  scientific  information  warrants  an  earlier  review,  the  Recommended  Curve  should  be 
updated in five years and then again by 2025, as well as at least once every 25 years thereafter. 
Regional Sea Level Rise 
Global  sea  level  rise  expectations  must  be  adjusted  to  account  for  regional  variations  and  for 
crustal movements particular to the area under consideration.  Regional variations to be considered 
include: 
  Variations particular to the Pacific Ocean Basin and to the NW Pacific portion;6 
  Variations particular to coastal British Columbia waters; 
  Local  variations  caused  by  crustal  movement,  leading  to  land  uprising  or  subsidence,  which 

may offset or exacerbate the sea level rise. 

The BC Sea Level Report (2008) provides the most recent summary of expected regional or local 
climate change effects on sea level rise.  Recommended local variations for crustal movement are 

                                                      
6 Available satellite measurements of recent sea level rise show considerable variation around the globe compared to 
the often quoted global means. Specific information on the regional variation expected over the North Pacific and 
offshore coastal British Columbia during upcoming climate change is not as readily available at this time.  This 
regional effect remains an element of uncertainty.

provided in Chapter 3.0 - BC Sea Level Report (2008). Additional detail on subsidence rates for 
specific areas of coastal BC area are provided in Appendix B. 
 
In general terms, for most of coastal British Columbia, with the exception of the Lower Mainland 
area and the Richmond – Delta regions in particular, vertical land movement is positive (rising) at 
rates between 1 and 3 mm/yr.  Over a period of 100 years this will decrease the expected global 
SLR by 0.1 to 0.3 m, but not enough to overcome the expected effects of climate change. 
Subsidence is expected in the Richmond-Delta region at average rates of 1 to 2 mm/yr.  Over a 
period of 100 years these rates will increase the expected sea level rise due to global SLR by 0.1 
to 0.2 m. 

3.2.4  Astronomical Tides 

Predictions  of  expected  water  levels  due  to  astronomical  tides  are  available  throughout  coastal 
British Columbia from the Canadian Hydrographic Service (CHS), Fisheries and Oceans Canada 
and are published annually under the authority of CHS.  Volumes 5 through 7 of the Canadian Tide 
and  Current  Tables  (issued  annually)  provide  sufficient  information  on  astronomical  tidal 
characteristics for planning and preliminary design throughout most of BC coastal areas, through a 
combination of Principal Reference Ports and numerous Secondary Ports. 
As  the  tidal  information  at  Secondary  Ports  is  often  based  on  limited  durations  of  observations 
(typically one month or possibly less), they may not be current and as they only provide corrections 
for times and heights of specific tide parameters, project specific tidal measurement programs must 
be undertaken for all projects, at the project location, prior to detailed design. 
Indicative tidal ranges are summarized in Table 3-1.  The published data in Volumes 5 through 7 of 
the  Canadian  Tide  and  Current  Tables  for  specific  areas  within  each  general  region  should  be 
consulted as tidal ranges can vary by 1 m or more within each region.  Tidal ranges within a river 
estuary  will  also  vary  significantly;  both  by  location  within  the  estuary  and  according  to  river 
discharge.  Guidelines are available in Volume 5 for the Fraser River. 
The tide ranges given in Table 3-1 have additional variation as noted below: 
 
 

Inter-annual variation due to the 18.6 year cycle of tides (typically of the order of ± 0.1 m) 
Intra-annual (seasonal) variation due to the particulars of the astronomical bodies and orbits 
driving the tidal forcing 

In  coastal  British  Columbia  waters,  the  mean  tidal  water  level  during  the  typical  stormy  winter 
season (approximately mid-October through mid-January) will not be equal to the MWL from the 
CHS published information as represented below in Table 3-1. 
Definition  of  the  Designated  Flood  Level  for  the  design  of  a  sea  dike  will  require  definition  of  a 
combination of appropriate tidal water levels and meteorological related water levels. 
Joint probability analysis methods are often used to define appropriate combinations of tide and 
storm surge that reflect the times of occurrence of the two processes; however, as tide is totally 
independent of storm occurrence and resulting storm surge, reasonable and valid estimates can be 
made  by  treating  the  statistics  of  each  process  as  independent.    In  this  case,  the  combined 
probability is simply the product of the probability of high tide during the time period of interest and 
the probability of the Designated Storm. 
Guidance for defining appropriate combinations of storm surge is provided below in Section 3.2.5.

3.2.5  Meteorological Water Level Effects 

Sea levels along coastal British Columbia are also affected by meteorological and oceanographic 
conditions specific to the area that result in differences between the predictable astronomical tides 
(Section 3.2.4) and the actual water level at a given time.  These conditions include: 
  Sea level change due to changes in atmospheric pressure. 
  Sea level change due to the effects of strong winds blowing over the water surface. 
  Sea level change due to wave momentum effects in shallow water 
  Sea level change due to changes in ocean currents or temperature. 
The integrated effect of these forcing mechanisms can be seen in measured water level data by 
removing the predicted astronomical tide, which then defines a residual water level that reflects all 
of the forcing mechanisms outlined above. 
In coastal British Columbia waters, the characteristics of residual water levels can be defined with 
the assistance of the long term measured water level records available from several long term CHS 
tide recording stations along the coast.  Long records of recorded total water levels are available at 
the stations summarized in Table 3-2.

Prince Rupert 

A  preliminary  review  and  evaluation  of  the  residual  water  levels  resulting  from  these  stations  is 
provided in the support materials provided in Appendix D. 
Regional Meteorological Effects 
A preliminary review of the residual water levels achieved at each station (Appendix D) indicates 
that the general characteristics of residual water levels can be summarized on a regional basis as 
follows: 
  West Coast Vancouver Island – Juan de Fuca Strait and Georgia Strait:  
  Central Coast – Queen Charlotte Islands – North Coast:  
The larger residual water levels recorded at the Tofino and Prince Rupert tide gauge locations are 
shown in Figure 3-2, which shows the peak water level after the predicted tide is removed.  For 
clarity  the  only  events  shown  are  those  over  a  threshold  chosen  so  that  at  least  one  event  is 
present for every year of record.  A review of the higher events from each data set confirmed that 
the events were not spikes, with limited (one or two hours) duration above the threshold, and that 
they correspond to known severe storms on the coast. 
A preliminary extreme value analysis of the available data sets at Tofino and Prince Rupert, using a 
Peak  over  Threshold  extreme  value  methodology,  after  ensuring  that  at  least  72  hours  exists 
between  each  event,  and  after  considering  the  effect  of  various  threshold  values,  gives  the 
estimates  of  expected  residual  water  levels  for  a  range  of  annual  exceedance  probabilities  (or 
return periods) summarized in Table 3-3. 
A  comparison  of  inter-station  residual  time  series  during  large  events  indicates  that  the  peak 
residual  values  vary  approximately  ±  0.1  m  among  the  stations  within  the  two  groups  indicated 
above.

Local Meteorological Effects 
The tide gauges used for the analyses summarised above are generally located within harbours or 
on the open coast in deep water.  Many sea dikes will be located inshore of the inter-tidal profile 
and may have extensive areas of shallow water or drying inter-tidal banks – ie: Boundary Bay or

the West Richmond sea dikes - offshore of the dike.  In these situations the effect of strong winds 
and  waves  may  further  increase  the  water  level  during  storms  and  site  specific  analysis  will  be 
required. 
Methodologies  for  assessing  the  magnitude  of  additional  surge  are  outlined  in  the  Reference 
Publications. 
Examples of the magnitude of these local effects are provided in the sample cases in Appendix C. 

3.2.6  Wave Climate 

Incident Deepwater Wave Climate 
Definition  of  appropriate  sea  dike  crest  elevations  will  require  specification  of  the  incident  wave 
climate during storms that are consistent with the selected design criteria.  For most sea dikes, with 
their seaward face situated at or above normal high tide elevations, the design wave climate will 
generally be controlled by the depth of water a short distance seaward of the toe.  Specification of 
the  appropriate  location  to  define  the  design  wave  climate  is  generally  unique  to  the  design 
methodology being used for a specific component of the dike.   
Reference must be made to the specific requirements in the Reference Publications. 
Local Wave Climate at the Dike 
As a preliminary guideline, the maximum seastate7 that can exist in a given depth of shallow water 
can  be  estimated  using  the  procedures  outlined  in  CIRIA;  CUR;  CETMEF  (2007)  or  US  Army 
Corps of Engineering (2002). 
The seastate that can exist at a sea dike depends strongly on the water depth at the toe of the sea 
dike, the slope of the foreshore in front of the sea dike and in some cases on the seaward slope of 
the sea dike itself. As guidance, the maximum seastate (Hs) 7 may be between approximately 0.5 
and 1.2 times the depth of water.  In general, an iterative procedure will be required during design 
to define the seastate. 
It  will  also  be  necessary  to  check  that  the  seastate  at  the  toe  of  the  dike  is  consistent  with  the 
Designated  Storm  for  the  annual  exceedance  probability  specified  for  the  sea  dike  planning  or 
design process. 
The details of the design seastate that are required for planning or design can be defined using the 
procedures outlined in EA, ENW, KFKI (2007) or specifically in Battjes, et al. (2000). 

3.2.7  Scour 

Waves and currents may cause scour to occur on the seabed adjacent to a sea dike.  The scour 
depth that may occur either during the design life of the sea dike or during the Designated Storm 
should be considered and either allowed for in defining the necessary sea dike crest elevation or 
scour protection should be provided as necessary. 

                                                      

7  The  term  “seastate”  is  used  in  this  document  to  encapsulate,  in  a  general  way,  all  of  the 
parameters and characteristics that may be needed during design to define the waves at a given 
instant in time.  The sea state is the general condition of the free surface of a body of water—with 
respect to wind waves and swell—at a certain location and moment. The sea state is characterized 
by  statistics, including wave  height(s),  period(s),  distribution  and  power spectrum.  The sea state 
varies with time, as the weather or oceanographic factors change.  For engineering purposes the 
seastate is often characterized by the significant wave height, Hs.

3.2.8  Freeboard 

It  is  common  practice  in  offshore  and  coastal  engineering  codes  and  standards  of  practice  to 
include  provision  for  uncertainties  by  specifying  a  minimum  freeboard  or  similar  allowance.   
Generally the freeboard accounts for the known uncertainties in technical elements of the design 
methodology,  i.e.,  the  appropriate  wave  theory  for  the  depth  of  water  or  variations  in  seabed 
conditions along the shoreline, among others.  
In the specific case of the sea level rise to be considered for design, the problem is compounded 
by  uncertainties  surrounding  the  present  estimates  of  the  future  extent  of  climate  change,  the 
resulting sea level rise, the time frame over which a particular decision is being made and in some 
cases for the actions or consequences of other stakeholders or property owners that may directly 
affect a particular shoreline area. 
A  more  detailed  review  of  issues  related  to  appropriate  freeboard  allowances  is  provided  in  the 
companion policy document: Policy Discussion Paper 20103. 
As  a  minimum,  it  is  recommended  that  the  present  freeboard  allowance  of  0.6  m  should  be 
included in sea dike design, above and beyond any specific allowances adopted to deal with the 
known uncertainties for the area in question.  These known uncertainties should be explicitly stated 
during design.

Sea Dike Design 

4.1.1  Crest Elevation 

General 
The crest elevation of a sea dike shall be established to provide the protection required during the 
Designated Storm.  
The Sea Dike Crest Elevation can be defined based on the following: 

Designated Flood Level + Wave Run-up + Freeboard 

  or: 

Designated Flood Level + Acceptable Crest Height 

 where: 
Wave Run-up = vertical distance above the mean water level exceeded, by no more than 2% of 
the waves at the toe of the sea dike 
Acceptable  Crest  Height  =  vertical  distance  above  the  mean  water  level  required  to  keep  any 
wave  overtopping  below  the  chosen  criteria  for  acceptable  rates  of  overtopping,  as  summarized 
below in Table 4-1 or Table 4-2. 
Alternatively an Acceptable Crest Height can be defined based on the results of a Quantitative Risk 
Analysis (QRA) process that identifies an acceptable amount of inundation during the Designated 
Storm. 
In general, a Sea Dike Crest Elevation is established so that any overtopping that occurs during the 
Designated Storm is within limits set to ensure that inundation behind the dike during the storm is 
acceptable, that it is within the limits considered during the design of the dike armour components, 
on the seaward and landward faces, and on the sea dike crest, and that it is consistent with any 
requirement for personnel to be present on the dike during the Designated Storm Event. 
The total quantity of overtopping during the Designated Storm should be defined to ensure that it is 
consistent with the FCL defined for inundation behind a Sea Dike. 
Overtopping of a sea dike can take two main forms.  If wave runup is high enough, relative to the 
crest elevation of the dike, water can pass over the dike as a nearly continuous sheet or plume of 
water.  In the second case, as waves break against the seaward face, a mixture of air and water 
droplets – spray – can be carried over the dike, either by the momentum of the breaking wave or by 
the added effect of entrainment into the onshore winds. Over time, if left undrained, the volume of 
water contained in the spray can accumulate and result in flooding (inundation) behind the dike. 
In  general,  it  is  usually  uneconomic  to  design  a  sea  dike  with  a  crest  elevation  high  enough  to 
prevent all overtopping.  In many cases, other factors, including available land, existing land uses, 
soil  conditions,  access,  visibility  over  the  dike  or  habitat  issues  may  limit  the  sea  dike  crest 
elevation. 
Guidance on acceptable limits for overtopping is available in the Reference Publications.  As initial 
guidance, the average or mean overtopping discharges summarized below in Table 4-1 and Table 
4-2 can be used. The criteria in Table 4-1 apply to a conventional sea dike with gentle seaward 
slopes.  The criteria in Table 4-2 can be used to estimate the crest elevation required for a vertical 
seawall that starts at or near the high tide elevation.

It should be noted that these criteria do not cover all possible configurations of sea dikes, or all 
issues that may be pertinent, and detailed engineering investigations may be required in specific 
cases.

Note: 
The existing criteria are vague on the definition of a building structural element. 

 
The criteria in Table 4-1 were partially validated in 2007 by tests using an overtopping simulator on 
a  real  sea  dike  in  the  Netherlands.    The  dike  had  an  landward  slope  of  1:3  (V:H)  and  was 
constructed  of  clay  (less  than  30  per  cent  sand)  with  a  thick  grass  sod  cover.    The  sea  dike 
successfully withstood a series of simulated 6 hour storms, up to a mean overtopping rate of 50 
liters/s/m. 
After  the  first  test,  the  grass  sod  was  removed  and  the  sequence  of  simulated  storms  was 
repeated.  It  was  found  that  erosion  damage started  on  the “unprotected”  dike  at  an  overtopping 
rate of 0.1 liters/s/m.  After 6 hours of overtopping at a mean rate of 10 liters/s/m, the sea dike was 
considered “not too far from initial breaching”.

Similar  testing  has  also  found  that  if  knowledgeable  people  (for  instance;  maintenance  or 
inspection  crews)  or  vehicles  (for  inspection  during  storms)  are  present  on  the  dike,  then  safety 
considerations may limit acceptable rates of overtopping to between 1 and 50 liters/s/m8. 
Along a dike of approximately 1000 m length, a limit of 10 liters/s/m implies that during a six hour 
storm the total volume of water overtopping the sea dike could amount to: 

10 liters/s/m x 1000 m x 6 h x 3600 sec/hr = 216 million liters = 216,000 m3 

This volume of water will amount to approximately 2 m of standing water over a land area of 10 
hectares, unless it can be drained away. 
In the case of the criteria in Table 4-2, it must be noted that reliable guidance does not exist to 
define the effect of distance on the decay rate of overtopping and therefore it may not be clear how 
far  behind  a  given  dike  or  seawall  a  building  must  be  to  satisfy  the  1  liter/m/s  threshold.    Site 
specific engineering investigations are warranted in many situations. 
Specification of a suitable Sea Dike Crest Elevation will generally be an iterative process as the 
volume of overtopping for a given Designated Storm will be significantly influenced by the design of 
the seaward face of the sea dike.  Acceptable quantities of overtopping may also be significantly 
influenced by the design of the landward face of the sea dike, especially if space or land use does 
not  permit  the  1:3  (V:H)  landward  slope  implied  by  the  criteria  in  Table  4-1.  Case  specific 
engineering investigations will be warranted in many situations. 
Examples of the application of the threshold conditions in Table 4-1 and Table 4-2 are provided in 
Appendix C. 

4.1.2  Seaward Face Design 

General 
The seaward face of a sea dike shall be designed to be stable and not vulnerable to breaching 
during the Designated Storm.  The design of the seaward face shall take into consideration any 
scour or erosion that may occur in front of the dike during the Designated Storm. 
Guidance 
Guidance  for  the  design  of  the  seaward  face  of  a  sea  dike  is  provided  in  the  Reference 
Publications. 

4.1.3  Landward Face Design 

General 
The landward face of a sea dike shall be designed to be stable and not vulnerable to erosion or 
scouring by overtopping water during the Designated Storm. 
Guidance 
Guidance  for  the  design  of  the  landward  face  of  a  sea  dike  is  provided  in  the  Reference 
Publications. 
It  should  be  noted  that  design  guidance  for  the  landward  face  of  a  sea  dike  that  is  exposed  to 
overtopping is, in general, limited in scope.  Structure specific detailed engineering investigations 
will  likely  be  required  if  the  design  is  different  from  the  1:3  (V:H)  landward  slope  implied  by  the 
criteria in Table 4-1 and Table 4-2. 

                                                      
8 These limits represent the extreme range that might be applicable.  An upper limit of 10 liters/s/m may be more 
appropriate if personnel are outside of a vehicle.

Definitions 
The  incorporation  of  climate  change  related  sea  level  rise  considerations  into  existing  BC 
Ministry of Environment documents is structured into three documents: 
  Draft Policy Discussion Paper 2010 
  Sea Dike Guidelines 2010 
  Guidelines for Management of Coastal Flood Hazard Land Use 2010. 
The  definitions  in  these  documents  follow,  where  possible,  the  definitions  and  terminology 
that  are  either  consistent  with  the  existing  documents  or  consistent  with  existing  practise 
worldwide.    In  some  cases  existing  definitions  or  terminology  require  modification  or 
clarification  for  application  to  coastal  flooding  or  sea  dike  application  in  a  climate  change 
driven sea level rise scenario. 
Existing  definitions  are  provided  below  in  italics  followed  by  any  necessary  modification, 
clarification or addition to the definitions or terminology in the existing documents. 
Acronyms associated with the definitions that are used in the text are shown in brackets. 

1.1  Annual Exceedence Probability (AEP) 
The  probability,  likelihood  or  chance  of  a  particular  event  (e.g.,  a  storm  or  a  storm  surge) 
being equalled or exceeded in any one year.  It is defined either as a number between 0 and 
1 or as a corresponding percentage. 
An  AEP  of  0.01  means  there  is  a 1% chance  of an  event,  of  a given  magnitude or  larger, 
occurring in any single given year. An AEP of 0.01 or 1/100 yr also suggests that on average, 
under certain conditions, the Average Return Period, or interval between recurrences of this 
event, is approximately 100 years.  

1.2  Average Return Period 
Over a long period of time, the average number of years between occurrences of a particular 
event. In general, the average return period is the reciprocal of the AEP – the relationship is 
illustrated in the following table:

Using AEP to define the likelihood of hazard events is preferable to the average return period 
as return period can lead to a false sense of security created by the belief that the indicated 
number of years will pass before the next event of that magnitude occurs. 

1.3  Designated Flood  
A flood, which may occur in any given year, of such a magnitude as to equal a flood having a 
200-year  recurrence  interval  based  on  a  frequency  analysis  of  unregulated  historic  flood 
records or by regional analysis where there is inadequate streamflow data available. Where 
the flow of a large watercourse is controlled by a major dam, the designated flood shall be set 
on a site-specific basis. 
In  coastal  areas,  the  existing  definition  of  a  Designated  Flood  is  not  appropriate  as  the 
probability of flooding from the sea is the result of the joint occurrence of tide and a storm 
crossing the coastal waters of British Columbia and at some time in the future, sea level rise 
due to climate change.  
In  estuaries,  where  a  river  discharges  into  the  sea,  the  definition  of  the  Designated  Flood 
applies to the river. 
In these documents the definition “Designated Flood” is replaced with the term “Designated 
Storm” as defined below. 

1.4  Designated Flood Level (DFL) 
The observed or calculated elevation for the Designated Flood and is used in the calculation 
of the Flood Construction Level. 
In  coastal  areas,  the  Designated  Flood  Level  (DFL)  includes  the  appropriate  allowance  for 
future sea level rise, tide and the total storm surge expected during the designated storm. 

1.5  Designated Storm (DS) 
A storm, which may occur in any given year, of such a magnitude as to equal a storm having 
the designated annual exceedence probability (AEP).  
The Designated Storm has several phenomena associated with it that will define components 
of  the  Designated  Flood  Level,  including  storm  surge,  wind  set-up,  wave  run-up  and 
overtopping for the storm.  These include: 
  A time series of atmospheric pressure during the passage of the storm over the area in 

question 

  A time series of wind speed and direction during the passage of the storm over the area 

in question 

  A time series of wave conditions, including wave heights, periods and directions during 

the passage of the storm in question. 

1.6  Diking Authority 
(a)  The  commissioners  of  a  district  to  which  Part  2  of  the  Drainage,  Ditch  and  Dike  Act 

applies, 

(b)  A person owning or controlling a dike other than a private dike, 
(b1) If the final agreement of a treaty first nation so provides, the treaty first nation in relation 

to dikes on its treaty lands,

(c)  A public authority designated by the minister as having any responsibility for maintenance 

of a dike other than a private dike, or 

(d)  A regional district, a municipality or an improvement district. 

1.7  Flood Construction Level (FCL) 
Uses the Designated Flood Level plus an allowance for Freeboard to establish the elevation 
of the underside of a wooden floor system or top of concrete slab for habitable buildings. In 
the  case  of  a  manufactured  home,  the  ground  level  or  top  of  concrete  or  asphalt  pad,  on 
which  it  is  located,  shall  be  equal  to  or  higher  than  the  above  described  elevation.  It  also 
establishes the minimum crest level of a Standard Dike. Where the Designated Flood Level 
cannot be determined or where there are overriding factors, an assessed height above the 
natural boundary of the water-body or above the natural ground elevation may be used (as 
defined in the Land Use Guidelines 2004).  
In coastal areas the FCL does not relate to the crest level of a sea dike, nor does it relate to 
the crest level of flood proofing fill exposed directly to the designated flood level.  The FCL 
does; however, include wave – structure interaction effects, to be determined at the location 
of the site of the building. 

1.8  Flood Construction Reference Plane (FCRP) 
The  vertical  elevation  of  an  estimated  future  Natural  Boundary  from  which  the  FCL  is 
determined. 

1.9  Flood Plain 
A lowland area, whether diked, flood proofed, or not, which, by reasons of land elevation, is 
susceptible to flooding from an adjoining watercourse, ocean, lake or other body of water and 
for  administration  purposes  is  taken  to  be  that  area  submerged  at  the  Designated  Flood 
Level. 
In  coastal  areas  the  concept  of  the  Flood  Plain  has  been  extended  to  a  “Sea  Level  Rise 
Planning Area”; defined below.  Special measures may be warranted in this area. 

1.10  Flood Proofing 
The  alteration  of  land  or structures  either physically  or  in use  to  reduce  flood  damage and 
includes the use of building setbacks from water bodies to maintain a floodway and allow for 
potential erosion. Flood Proofing may be achieved by all or a combination of the following: 
  Building on fill, provided such fill does not interfere with flood flows of the watercourse, 

and is adequately protected against floodwater erosion 

  Building raised by structural means such as foundation walls, columns, etc. 
  A combination of fill and structural means. 
In  coastal  areas  exposed  to  flooding,  construction  of  fill  as  a  flood  proofing  measure  may 
substantially increase the freeboard required to define the FCL, if the fill is directly exposed to 
the Designated Flood Level. In this case, the FCL must be equivalent to the crest level of a 
sea dike with the same characteristics as the seaward face of the fill.. 

1.11  Freeboard  
A  vertical  distance  added  to  the  Designated  Flood  Level.  Used  to  establish  the  Flood 
Construction Level.   

Appendix A 

3 

 

In coastal areas, the vertical distance to be added to a Designated Flood Level is site and 
structure specific. 

1.12  Natural Boundary 
Means the visible high watermark of any lake, river, stream or other body of water where the 
presence  and  action  of  the  water  are  so  common  and  usual  and  so  long  continued  in  all 
ordinary years as to mark upon the soil of the bed of the lake, river, stream or other body of 
water a character distinct from that of the banks thereof, in respect to vegetation, as well as in 
respect to the nature of the soil itself (Land Act, Section 1).  In addition, the natural boundary 
includes the best estimate of the edge of dormant or old side channels and marsh areas.  For 
coastal  areas,  the  natural  boundary  shall  include  the  natural  limit  of  permanent  terrestrial 
vegetation.  
Natural Boundary is an established concept in BC law – and reflects a change in vegetation 
and soil based on effects of the sea. In the Flood Hazard Area Land Use Guidelines 2004, 
building setbacks were established from Natural Boundary, on the unstated assumption that 
the location of Natural Boundary is relatively static (other than erosions and accretions).  
Natural boundary is, in practice, often difficult to determine in the field or from remote survey. 
In  coastal  areas,  the  Natural  Boundary  reflects  a  snapshot  historical  record  of  tide,  storm 
surge and wave runup effects, which may be the mark of a recent storm in an ordinary year or 
it may be the mark of the most severe storm in recent times.  There is no way of knowing for 
certain.  A technical basis for the Natural Boundary in coastal areas is site and time specific.  
In the future the location and elevation of a Natural Boundary will change from time to time 
due to changes associated with sea level rise and it will likely lag sea level rise.  It is also 
unlikely to immediately reflect the action of the water, especially the storm surge and waves, 
during a Designated Storm. 

1.13  Project Life 
The number of years a particular project; including a sea dike, a building or a community, is 
intended  to  serve  before  it  is  replaced,  upgraded  or  dismantled.    Regular  maintenance  to 
ensure the project provides the intended purpose is expected during the project life. 

1.14  Sea Dike 
A dike, floodwall or any other thing that prevents flooding of land by the sea. As defined in the 
Dike Maintenance Act, “dike” means “an embankment, wall, fill, piling, pump, gate, flood box, 
pipe, sluice, culvert, canal, ditch, drain”. 

1.15  Sea Dike Crest Elevation 
Sea  Dike  Crest  Elevation  has  essentially  the  same  meaning  as  “dike  crest  height”  in  the 
existing  document  “Dike  Design  and  Construction  Guide  2003”.  However,  the  existing 
definition  of  dike  height  suggests  that  consideration  of  wave  run-up  and  set-up  is  optional. 
The term Sea Dike Crest Elevation is defined to specifically cover scenarios where wave run-
up, overtopping and wind and wave setup must be included in defining the height of the dike. 

1.16  Sea Dike System 
A  system  of:  dikes,  dunes,  berms  or natural shorelines  that  provide  a  similar  function;  and 
associated  engineering  works  (e.g.,  tidal  gates,  outfalls,  outlet  structures,  seawalls,  quay 
walls, ramps, adjacent building features, etc.) used to protect land from flooding or inundation. 
In the Netherlands where dike systems are highly evolved, a dike system is termed a “dike 
ring” that forms the flooding defence for a region.  There are approximately 95 such rings in 

Appendix A 

4 

 

the Netherlands and each ring is the responsibility of a separate organizational entity, subject 
to national overview. 
In BC, multiple Diking Authorities may share responsibility for the same sea dike system. 

1.17  Sea Level Rise (SLR) 
An allowance for increases in the mean elevation of the ocean associated with future climate 
change, including any regional effects such as crustal subsidence or uplift.  

1.18  Sea Level Rise Planning Area (SLR Planning Area) 
An  area  of  land  that  may  be  subject  to  future  flooding  due  to  Sea  Level  Rise.  This  area 
defines a future coastal flood plain.  The SLR Planning Area extends from the existing Natural 
Boundary  landward  to  the  highest  predicted  point  of  potential  flooding  related  to  SLR  plus 
flooding  expected  from  the  combination  of  high  tide,  total  storm  surge  and  expected  wave 
runup during the Designated Storm. 
Predictions  of  SLR  for  the  SLR  Planning  Area  definition  shall  use  best  predictions  for 
minimum periods of 90-100 years and 200 years forward. From time to time, both the Natural 
Boundary and the predictions for SLR are subject to change, and therefore the extent of a 
SLR Planning Area may be revised at regular intervals in the future. 

1.19  Seastate 
The  term  “seastate”  is  used  to  encapsulate,  in  a  general  way,  all  of  the  parameters  and 
characteristics that may be needed during design to define the waves at a given instant in 
time.    The  sea  state  is  the  general  condition  of  the  free  surface  of  a  body  of  water—with 
respect  to  wind  waves  and  swell—at  a  certain  location  and  moment.  The  sea  state  is 
characterized  by  statistics,  including  wave  height(s),  period(s),  distribution  and  power 
spectrum. The sea state varies with time, as the weather or oceanographic factors change.  
For engineering purposes the seastate is often characterized by the significant wave height, 
Hs. 

1.20  Setback  
Means withdrawal or siting of a building or landfill away from the natural boundary or other 
reference line to maintain a floodway and to allow for potential land erosion.   

1.21  Standard Dikes 
Dikes built to a minimum crest elevation equal to the Flood Construction Level and meeting 
standards  of  design  and  construction  approved  by  the  Ministry  of  Environment  and 
maintained by an ongoing authority such as a local government body. 

1.22  Storm Surge  
A change in water level caused by the action of wind and atmospheric pressure variation on 
the  sea  surface.  The  typical  effect  is  to  raise  the  level  of  the  sea  above  the  predicted 
astronomical tide level, although in some situations, such as when winds blow offshore, the 
actual water level may be lower than that predicted. The magnitude of a storm surge on the 
BC  coast  will  be  dependent  on  the  severity  and  duration  of  the  storm  event  in  the  North 
Pacific, its track relative to the BC coast and the seabed bathymetry at the site. 

1.23  Total Storm Surge 
The combination of the storm surge generated in deep water plus the additional local surge or 
wind setup generated by the effect of the winds during the Designated Storm over shallow 

Appendix A 

5 

 

water at a particular site.  In general the deep water storm surge is nearly the same as that 
recorded at a tidal gauging station.  Additional surge may occur at other sites.  For planning 
purpose, winds during a Designated Storm will start to generate local surge in water depths 
less than 30 m. 

1.24  Wave Run-up 
The vertical distance that waves run-up the seaward slope of a structure or a shoreline.  The 
vertical  distance  is  measured  from  the  mean  water  level,  which  is  the  same  as  the 
Designated Flood Level. 
For  coastal  flooding  hazard  management  the  Wave  Run-up  is  taken  as  50  per  cent  of  the 
calculated  run-up  elevation  on  the  natural  shoreline.    This  ratio  is  based  on  analysis 
completed  for  this  assignment  (2010)  and  may  be  revised  as  more  information  becomes 
available. 
For defining a Sea Dike Crest Elevation the Wave Run-up is taken to be the vertical distance 
exceeded by no more than 2% of the waves during the Designated Storm at the toe of the 
sea dike 

1.25  Wave Set-up  
An increase in mean water surface close to the shoreline caused by wave action; important 
during storm events as it results in a further increase in water level above the tide and surge 
levels, landward of the location where waves start to break. Wave set-up will lead to larger 
waves existing at the seaward toe of a sea dike than might otherwise be expected. 

1.26  Wave Overtopping 
The passage of water over the top of a sea dike as a result of wave runup or related surge 
and setup.  Water overtopping a sea dike may pass over the dike as a flow of water or as 
spray and the specific characteristics are site and structure specific. 

1.27  Wind Set-up 
A rise of the water surface above the water level on the open coast due to the local action of 
wind stress on the water surface.

Uplift and Subsidence Rates  

Introduction 
This Appendix provides a brief summary of the available information on subsidence and uplift 
rates along the British Columbia coast. 
The BC Sea Level Report (2008) – Chapter 3 - provides a description of crustal movements 
along the coast of British Columbia and a brief summary of rates for selected locations. More 
specific  site detail  is  provided  in  Table  1-1  based  on  an unpublished  addendum  to  the  BC 
Sea Level Report (2008) provided by BCMOE. 

Site Specific Data 
The data in Table 1-1 summarizes the rates of uplift (positive) or subsidence (negative) and 
the standard error based on relative sea-level rates corrected for eustatic sea level rise (tide 
gauge stations) or on absolute trends of vertical motion (GPS stations).

Examples of Sea Dike Guidelines 

Introduction 
The sea dike examples shown in this Appendix are intended solely as examples of the application 
of the Sea Dike Guidelines and are not intended as specific guidelines for dike requirements at any 
of the locations.  Simplifying assumptions have been made in the development of these examples, 
especially with regard to design criteria, solely for the purpose of developing examples.  A detailed 
planning  or  design  process  will  need  to  undertake  site  specific  investigations  to  develop  the 
appropriate  design  criteria.    The  examples  illustrated  in  this  section  also  do  not  consider 
environmental or land-use issues and the dike footprints shown in these examples do not reflect 
any  consideration  of  these  important  issues.    No  consideration  is  given  to  the  stages  of  design, 
approval  or  construction  that  might  be  necessary  to  implement  these  examples  nor  do  the 
examples reflect any consideration of alternate designs that might be suitable based on detailed 
site specific requirements or design.

Boundary Bay Sea Dike 

1.2.1  Location 

The  existing  Boundary  Bay  sea  dike  is  located  along  the  south  boundary  of  the  Corporation  of 
Delta  (Delta)  and  the  north  shore  of  Boundary  Bay,  Figure  1-1.    The  dike,  which  runs  from 
approximately 17A Ave. in Tsawwassen to the boundary with Surrey in the east, generally protects 
low  lying  agricultural  land.    The  protected  area  also  includes  the  Boundary  Bay  airport  and  the 
Delta Heritage Airport.  
The dike is directly exposed to long-term sea level rise, tides, storm surge and to the local wind 
setup and the wave climate generated by SE through SW winds associated with severe storms in 
the south end of the Strait of Georgia and across Boundary Bay, Figure 1-2.  The maximum direct 
exposure is due S across to Orcas Island in the US Gulf Islands; however, wave generation may 
occur over the open water extending SE towards Rosario Strait, located east of Orcas Island.  The 
maximum available fetch is limited to approximately 45 km. 
The seaward slope of the existing dike is armoured with a conventional armour stone protection 
system.  A gravel road (with some paved sections) is located on the crest, Figure 1-3 and Figure 
1-4.  The landward slope is planted with grass, Figure 1-5. 
The existing dike cross-section in the vicinity of this example is shown in Figure 1-6. 
 Land elevations in the area behind the dike are reported to be subsiding at a rate of approximately 
1-2 mm/year.  Typical present (2010) land elevations behind the dike are approximately 1.5 to 1.8 
m CGD. 
The net expected (including land subsidence) regional sea level rise by 2100 for this area is 1.2 m.

Richmond – Sturgeon Bank Sea Dike 

1.3.1  Location 

The Richmond-Sturgeon Bank Sea Dike is located on the shoreline of West Richmond and protects 
the City of Richmond from inundation by storm surge and associated wave effects from the Strait of 
Georgia, Figure 1-8. The sea dike is one part of the dike system that surrounds Richmond. 
The dike is directly exposed to sea level rise, storm surges and only indirectly to the wave climate 
in the Strait of Georgia as some protection is provided by the extensive inter-tidal flats of Sturgeon 
Bank, by the jetties located on the main and north arms of the Fraser River and by the Iona jetty.  
This site is most exposed to severe NW winds that follow in the wake of severe storm systems; 
however at  a  detailed  stage  of  evaluation,  consideration  about  the  present  and  future  degree  of 
protection against SE and S winds provided by the Steveston Jetty will be required. 
The seaward slope of the existing dike consists of a grass covered 1:5 slope with a steep grass 
covered landside slope leading to a drainage channel, Figure 1-9 and Figure 1-10.  The existing 
dike cross-section in the vicinity of this example is shown in Figure 1-11. 
Land-use immediately behind the dike consists mainly of residential and recreational (golf course) 
land  uses,  Figure 1-12.  Some  areas  of  the  adjacent  lands have  recently  been  redeveloped  to  a 
higher density than the historical single-family housing,  
Land elevations in the area are reported to be subsiding at a rate of approximately 1-2 mm/year. 
The net expected (including land subsidence) regional sea level rise by 2100 for this area is 1.2 m.

The resulting crest elevations in Table 1-2 show clearly how careful evaluation of the acceptance 
criteria for overtopping volumes of water is critical to the design of a sea dike that can be expected 
to provide the required degree of safety to the community located behind the dike. 
Changes to the dike cross-section, including details of the toe protection that might be considered, 
the slope of the seaward and landward faces and the surface treatment of both slopes will result in 
different crest elevations from those presented in Table 1-2.

Granville Island 
Granville Island is a popular and developed urban site located inside False Creek in Vancouver, 
BC, Figure 1-14.  At present, the area is not diked and flooding has not been experienced during 
storms on the existing grade slab, which has an elevation of approximately + 4 m CGD.  As sea 
level rises over the next century, the area will become exposed to an increasing risk of flooding and 
measures will need to be taken to adapt to the risk.  If protection of the existing land-use is adopted 
as the option, a sea dike will be required. 
For  the  purpose  of  this  example  the  west  end  of  Granville  Island,  which  is  partially  exposed  to 
English Bay, Figure 1-15 and Figure 1-16, is considered. 
Land elevations in the area are reported to be stable, neither rising nor subsiding. 
The net expected (including land subsidence) regional sea level rise by 2100 for this area is 1.0 m.

(Updated Guidelines) 

  Tides: Based on CHS Tide Tables, Vol 5, Secondary Port: 7710 False Creek 
  Designated Storm assumed to have storm force winds (≥ 48 knots); the maximum seastate

simultaneously. 

  Storm Surge during Designated Storm as per Table 3-3, this document. 
  Wave set-up is included in the determination of Wave Runup. 
  A  near  vertical  seawall  was  adopted  for  the  sea  dike  in  this  example  due  to  the  close 
proximity of highly used public buildings near  the edge of the existing island slope.  For 
simplicity, the presence of the overhanging timber deck platforms was not considered. 

  The mean overtopping rate criteria in Table 4-2 are assumed to apply for a seaward slope 

consisting of a vertical seawall located at the top of the existing rock armoured slope.

1.4.2  Conceptual Dike Arrangement 

 
An  example  seawall  dike  cross-section  for  the  year  2100,  as  per  Table  1-3,  is  shown  below  in 
Figure 1-17 where the top of the seawall, not including a freeboard allowance, is designed for an 
overtopping acceptance criteria of 0.4 L/s/m, which is expected to keep any spray loads at or below 
the  capacity  of  the  adjacent  buildings.  This  acceptance  threshold  is  higher  than  might  be 
appropriate  if  untrained  casual  pedestrians  were  expected  to  be  present  during  storms.  The 
example seawall is located on the existing grade slab on Granville Island of approximately +4 m 
CGD.  Foundation considerations have not been addressed in this example.

Introduction 
This Appendix provides a brief summary of investigations undertaken to provide guidelines for 
the preparation of the document: Sea Dike Guidelines, 2010. 
Further investigations are warranted as noted in each case. 

Atmospheric Sea Level Rise in BC Coastal Waters  

Introduction 
Sea levels along the coastal British Columbia coast are strongly affected by the mid-latitude 
storm systems in the North Pacific.  The strong winds and low atmospheric pressures in the 
storms  result  in  a  large,  though  low  in  amplitude,  surge  wave  that  affects  considerable 
portions of the Northwest North American coastline at the same time. 
A  detailed  discussion  of  all  aspects  of  these  storm  systems  is  beyond  the  scope  of  this 
document;  however  a  brief  discussion  is  provided  as  background  to  the  definition  of  storm 
surge used in this document. 
In particular, the connection between the offshore character of the storms and the resulting 
storm surge is discussed.  As an example, the storm of 12 March – 15 March, 2010 is shown 
below.  This storm entered the Gulf of Alaska near the southern tip of the Aleutian Islands on 
12  March  2010,  moving  in  a  generally  easterly  direction  along  the  50th  parallel  of  latitude, 
Figure 2-1. 
The evolution of the storm over the period up to 15 March 2010 is shown in Figure 2-2, by 
which time hurricane force winds were expected in the Hecate Strait area of coastal British 
Columbia.  This storm generated gale to storm force winds throughout much of the Gulf of 
Alaska. 
The surface effect of the storm winds on 12 March can be seen in Figure 2-3, where the red 
shading centred approximately on the 53rd parallel of latitude corresponds to a surge, above 
tide, of approximately 0.6 m.  This large area of surge is being setup by the combination of 
the inverse barometer affect due to the low atmospheric pressure and to the effect of the gale 
to storm force winds circulating around the low pressure centre. 
In  this  particular  case,  the  storm  crossed  the  North  American  coastline  north  of  Dixon 
Entrance and the surge mainly affected Alaska state coastal waters.  A track south of the 50th 
parallel would have brought the deepwater surge directly onto the British Columbia coast. The 
length of coastline affected by the storm surge for a storm of this severity is clearly as long or 
even longer than the west coast of British Columbia.

Expected Coastal Deepwater Storm Surges for BC 
Examination of the surges recorded along the BC coastline has shown that in many, if not in 
most cases, the deepwater surge generated in the North Pacific, after modification over the 
continental  shelf,  arrives  relatively  unchanged  at  all  stations  in  the  general  north  coast  or 
south coast areas of British Columbia.  An example of the storm surges recorded on the coast 
for a storm on 9 – 16 December 1995, is shown in Figure 2-4 and illustrates how the surge 
wave  retains  its  main  characteristics  all  the  way  from  its  arrival  on  the  west  coast  of 

Appendix D 

3 

 

Vancouver Island (as recorded at Tofino), its passage up Juan de Fuca Strait (as recorded at 
Victoria and then into the Strait of Georgia (as recorded at Point Atkinson).  The peak of the 
surge, at approximately 22:00 hr on 12 December at Point Atkinson, occurred 5 hours earlier 
at Tofino and only increased in magnitude by approximately 0.1 m.  The peak of the surge, 
which is at least 6 hours long (within a 0.1 m tolerance), coincided with a peak in the gale 
force SE winds that characterised this particular storm.  
As part of this assignment, the self-similar characteristics of the incident surge wave from the 
North  Pacific  were  examined  for  multiple  storms  and  the  trend  exhibited  in  Figure  2-4  is 
typical.    On  the  basis  of  these  trends  the  expected  magnitudes  for  the  incident  deepwater 
storm surge were grouped and characterized as described in this report.

Local Storm Surge 
The incident deepwater storm surge, as illustrated in Figure 2-4, will be further modified as it 
propagates over shallow water, especially across the extensive tidal flats in the Fraser River 
Delta.    Methods  for  estimating  the  additional  effects  are  provided  in  the  Reference 
Publications.

2.4 

Joint Occurrence of Storm Surge and Tide 
An  important  element  in  the  design  of  a  sea  dike  is  establishing  the  appropriate  stage  of 
astronomical tide, for combination with a storm surge, to be used for setting the total water 
level, and associated wind and wave related effects, for the Designated Flood Level. 
This  topic  is  an  area  of  ongoing  research  and  development  and  warrants  additional 
investigations  of  its  own.    For  the  purpose  of  this  document,  which  maintains  the  existing 
guidance in the Dike Design and Construction Guide 2003, that combines the maximum 
high tide with the appropriate storm surge, the problem becomes one of assigning an AEP to 
the selection of the storm surge (and the Designated Storm) that is consistent with the total 
water level or Designated Flood Level. 
The problem can be addressed by considering storms and the associated effects, including 
storm surge, winds and waves, as processes that are totally independent of the astronomical 
tides.  The combined probability, or alternatively, the AEP of the combined effects, becomes 
simply the product of the probability of the storm and the probability of there being a high tide 
present on the coast at the same time. 
The  simultaneous  values  of  residual  water  levels  and  the  associated  astronomical  tides 
recorded at Tofino are shown in Figure 2-5.  This data, which covers approximately 66 winter 
storm periods during the total record shows that the combination of both a high tide (4.1 m) 
and a high storm surge (residual water level) is quite rare. 
 

Figure 2-5:  Simultaneous Residual Water Levels and Predicted Tide – Tofino 

Note: MWL = 2.1 m (predicted tide) 

 
In simple terms, the probability of having a high tide during the winter storm season, which 
typically spans 3 to 4 months (mid-October to mid-January), is related to the number of days 
in this period when a high tide is expected – spring tides typically exist for approximately 3 

 

Appendix D 

5 

 

days every 2 weeks and during those three days only exist for 2 to 3 hours (within a range of 
approximately ± 0.1 m) on each of the three days. 
The probability of a high tide window is then approximately: 
3 days x 2 hours/window 
14 days x 24 hours/day  

3 days x 3 hours/window 
14 days x 24 hours/day  

   or between  

1/56 to 1/37 

 
 to 
 

 

 

 

 
As the duration of the peak of a storm surge is typically approximately 6 hours long (within a 
range of ± 0.1 m), or approximately twice the duration of the high tide then the probability of 
having the peak of a storm surge at high tide becomes 2/56 to 2/37 or 1/26 to 1/18.5.  

For the purpose of this report we have taken the probability of a high tide window during the 
occurrence of a storm to be approximately 1/20.  On this basis the total AEP for high tide and 
a typical winter storm (the annual average expected storm) becomes 1/20 x ½ ≈ 1/40.  By the 
same reasoning the estimated AEP for the total water level during the largest storm surge of 
record shown in Figure 2-5, occurring at MWL becomes approximately 1 x 1/300 ≈ 1/300. 
 
The AEP for high tide and a storm with an AEP of 1/200 years (the current guidance AEP) 
becomes 1/20 x 1/200 ≈ 1/4000. 
 
The AEP for a storm that will yield a Designated Flood Level with an AEP of 1/10000 years 
becomes 1/500, which is not significantly greater in actual effect than the current guidance in 
British Columbia. 
 

2.5 

Joint Occurrence of Storm Surge and Waves 
The selection of a sea dike crest elevation that satisfies the chosen design criteria requires 
the identification of the wave climate that is expected to occur during the Designated Storm.  
Preliminary examination of the joint occurrence of recorded waves and residual water levels 
(storm  surge)  from  two  areas  in  coastal  British  Columbia  waters  suggests  that  the  largest 
waves are not necessarily associated with the largest storm surges, Figure 2-6 and Figure 
2-7. 
For the purpose of this assignment it has been assumed for the sea dike examples, that the 
wave climate present at the sea dike is controlled by the depth of water at the sea dike and 
that  the  wave  climate  in  deep  water  is  sufficient  to  sustain  the  depth  limited  conditions.  
Further  investigations  are  warranted  for  all  areas  of  coastal  British  Columbia  and  will  be 
required during more detailed engineering for sea dikes.
