Health Facilities Preparation for Extreme Heat
Recommendations for Retirement and Care Facility Managers
The number of heat waves and extreme heat events is increasing. Extreme heat is a health risk. People in non-air conditioned buildings or 
in buildings during power outages are at greater risk. Below are recommendations for effective health facility management to protect your 
staff and patients.

Cooling Measures for Existing Buildings and Outdoor Spaces

Key Actions 
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

Monitor indoor heat:
Block direct sun:
Increase air flow:
Dehumidifiers:
Electric Fans:
Air conditioner:

	Follow	your	regional	requirements	(thermometers,	thermohygrometers,	WBGT).	

	Use	window	awnings,	shutters,	thermal	curtains/blinds,	and	outdoor	umbrellas.
	Encourage	cross	breeze	(electric	fans,	open	windows).
	Effective	in	areas	with	high	humidity,	but	give	off	heat.
	Effective	in	dry	heat,	but	efficiency	decreases	with	high	humidity.

	Effective	during	extreme	heat.

Considerations for Management of Staff and Supplies

Key Actions

Staff Education and Protection

Educate	(or	refresh)	staff	annually	on	signs	and	symptoms	of	heat	illnesses	such	as	dehydration,	heat	cramps,	heat	
exhaustion,	and	heat	stroke	(classic	and	exertional).
Ensure	staff	is	trained	in	and	follow	first	aid	procedures	appropriately.	(
Develop	and	educate	your	staff	on	heat	emergency	plans.
Follow	your	emergency/surge	procedure	to	ensure	adequate	capacity	(staff	and	supplies)	and	ensure	personnel	are	
working	within	ACGIH	TLV®	Guidelines	for	work-rest	cycles	in	the	heat,	as	outlined	in	your	region,	with	use	of	
personal	cooling	options.

Refer to Health Canada’s Acute Care Fact Sheet.)

Facility Maintenance

Patient / Resident care

Follow	your	existing	regional	requirements	to	keep	the	facility	cool	and	comfortable.
Evacuate	room(s)	if	extremely	high	temperature	occurs	(determine	on	a	case	by	case	basis).

Ensure	cooling	supplies	are	available	for	your	patients	and	residents	(e.g.	cooling	jackets,	ice	water	baths)	and	
appropriate	support	to	avoid	injury.
Provide	cooling	options/areas,	available	for	several	hours	each	day,	(designated	cool	room,	cool	showers,	fan,	place	to	
bathe	hands/forearms	or	sponging	with	cool	water).
Keep	medications	cool	(storage	below	26°C	for	room	temperature	is	typical).
Ensure	meals	with	high	water	content	are	prepared	and	that	spoiled	food	is	discarded.

Considerations for Care Management During Extreme Heat

Key Actions 
•	

Review	clinical	management	of	patients	and	residents	most	at	risk	either	due	to	reduced	mobility,	chronic	illnesses	
(pulmonary,	cardiovascular,	renal),	and	certain	medications,	social	isolation,	inadequate	housing,	or	environmental	factors	
(urban	heat	island,	air	pollution).	(Refer to Health Canada’s Acute Care Fact Sheet.)
Increase	frequency	of	patient	observations,	especially	of	those	at	high	risk.	
Advise	staff	to	closely	monitor	early	indicators	of	heat	illnesses	and	initiate	appropriate	treatment	(Check	patient	and	room	
temperature,	monitor	fluid	intake	and	output,	pulse	rate,	and	blood	pressure).
Consider	indoor/outdoor	temperatures	when	planning	group	activities.

Facility Emergency Plan Check List

Key Actions to Prepare for Extreme Heat
	❏
Have	an	integrated	plan	for	extreme	heat	events.	
If	no	plan	exists,	create	a	plan	on	how	extreme	heat	will	be	managed,	and	integrate	it	into	your	current	facility’s	
	❏
emergency	plan.
Provide	staff	training	on	extreme	heat	emergency	measures.	
Regularly	review	prevention	and	emergency	guidelines	with	staff	–	this	increases	effectiveness.

	❏
	❏
Key Elements to Include in a Heat Emergency Plan
	❏
	❏
	❏
	❏
	❏
	❏

Administrative	procedure	to	meet	emergency/surge	staff	capacity	needs.
Plan	staff	training	on	heat-health	risk	information.
Steps	to	follow	to	keep	older	adults	and	the	chronically	ill	cool	and	comfortable.	
Emergency	cooling	options	(air-conditioned	rooms,	fans,	ice-water	baths/showers).
Identify	need	for	back-up	generators,	during	possible	power	brown-outs/black-outs.
Plan	to	manage	employee	heat	exhaustion	(e.g.	air	conditioning	in	the	staff	room,	light-weight	breathable	uniforms).

Planning for New Facilities and Renovations

Key Actions for Capacity Building
•	
•	

Understand	how	the	built	environment	affects	human	health.
Coordination	with	public	health	professionals	and	planners	to:

•	
•	

Discuss	information	regarding	the	effects	of	the	built	environment	on	health.
Develop	a	plan	to	reduce	the	carbon	foot-print	(e.g.	use	green	space	strategically	to	provide	shade)	and	the	urban	heat	
island	(e.g.	consider	alternate	surfaces	for	parking	lots	and	roofs)	contributions	of	your	facility.
