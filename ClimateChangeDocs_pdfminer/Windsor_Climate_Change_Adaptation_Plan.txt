Climate Change Adaptation Plan  2012 

 
Executive Summary 

Regardless of the cause, the average temperature in Windsor has increased by almost 1°C since 1940. 
Scientists predict that by 2050, the average annual temperature in Ontario will increase by 2.5°C to 
3.7°C from the1961-1990 baseline average. This change, along with predictions that the number of 
“hot” days (over 30 °C/86 °F) in Windsor could almost quadruple by 2071-2100, is cause for concern. 
Heat related illnesses place a strain on our health care services and energy used to cool our buildings is 
expensive.  In addition, this shift in the average weather for the region allows for the survival of invasive 
species and the expansion or introduction of insect vectors that carry disease. 

As air temperature increases, so does the capacity of the air to hold more water. This can lead to more 
intense rainfall events, which Windsor has already experienced directly including events in 2007 and 
2010 which caused severe flooding. In 2011, Windsor experienced the wettest year on record, 
measuring 1,568mm of rain compared to the average annual rainfall of 844mm. Increased temperature 
and intense rainfall events are two climate change impacts that have resulted in direct costs to Windsor 
residents through basement flooding and heat related illness expenses. 

Municipalities have a significant role to play in climate change adaptation as many climate change 
impacts will directly affect the services provided by the City of Windsor and our agencies. This plan was 
developed through consultation with all City departments and select City agencies.  Each department 
was asked to look at all of their potential impacts and determine which impacts would present the most 
significant challenges to operations.  Once these impacts were agreed upon, a vulnerability and risk 
assessment was completed to further narrow down the potential impacts that pose the greatest risk to 
the municipality as a whole.   

The focus of this adaptation plan is on the following five potential climate change impacts which were 
rated as posing substantial risk and therefore may result in the greatest impact on our municipal 
operations: 

1. 
2. 
3. 

4. 
5. 

Increase in operating/maintenance demands to deal with climate extremes. 
Increased chance of flooding to basements, roads and other infrastructure 
Increase in demand to all areas of Operations when responding to an increase in severe storms 
(during and after). 
Increase in public health risks due to extreme heat. 
Implementation of development policies which were created in the absence of Climate Change 
considerations, which may increase our vulnerability. 

The list below summarizes the proposed short-term adaptation actions suggested to increase Windsor’s 
resiliency to weather extremes. Many of these short-term actions build on existing programs in 
recognized areas of vulnerability.  Other adaptation options may be fairly new to the City of Windsor, 
however there is a growing level of expertise available amongst other municipalities.

While these short-term actions may help reduce Windsor’s current vulnerability, the City also needs to 
develop on-going strategies that will continue to address the changing climate over the long-term. The 
following strategies should be undertaken to ensure that the City of Windsor continues to be a leader on 
adaptation well into the future: 

Incorporate climate change adaptation into city policies and high level plans; 

1. 
2.  Create internal mechanisms to ‘ask the climate question’ for all new major infrastructure 

projects; 

3.  Monitor climate change, evaluate the effectiveness of adaptation strategies and adjust as 

needed (adaptive management); 

4.  Use best available science to analyze how the climate is changing locally and how this may 

impact the community; 

5.  Routinely review the City of Windsor’s vulnerability to climate change; 
6.  Continuously conduct risk assessments to identify priority impacts requiring adaptation actions,  
7.  Engage the public, business and other stakeholder groups. 

The actions taken today by the City of Windsor to proactively adapt to the changing climate will enhance 
community resilience to climate change while reducing the human and economic costs of climate-
related impacts. Adaptation actions can often lead to great cost savings as intense storm events and 
extreme heat can result in devastating expenses to repair infrastructure, basement flooding and 
minimize health care costs.

Context 

Municipalities have an important role to play in both mitigating and adapting to changes in their local 
environment. The City of Windsor is already experiencing the effects of climate change.  We’ve seen 
more intense summer storms than in previous years which have contributed to increased basement 
flooding.  The summer of 2010 was reported as the second hottest on record, only 0.3⁰C degrees cooler 
than the summer of 2005, the hottest on record. Warming of the Great Lakes has contributed to major 
ecosystem impacts such as extensive algae growth, the invasion of non-native species, pathogen and 
water borne diseases and falling lake levelsi. The West Nile virus and the increase in Lyme disease in 
Ontario are other consequences of climate changeii.   

The climate will continue to change.  Although reducing greenhouse gas emissions is vital to limiting the 
rate and amount of change, it cannot prevent climate change from occurring over at least the next 
several decadesiii.   As a result, governments and communities must now consider how to adapt to the 
unavoidable effects of climate change.  Therefore, in addition to the City of Windsor’s initiatives to 
mitigate climate change, it is becoming more evident that the City of Windsor needs to increase the 
adaptive capacity of the community.   

ICLEI Initiative 

ICLEI – Local Governments for Sustainability (Management) Inc., referred to as ICLEI Canada is an 
international association of local governments as well as national and regional local government 
organizations that have made a commitment to sustainable development.  On November 8th, 2010, 
Windsor City Council approved participation in ICLEI’s Climate Change Adaptation Initiative (CR 
408/2010). This program provided a straightforward methodology to adaptation planning which 
resulted in the creation of this Plan. The initiative will continue to build capacity internally for ongoing 
implementation and monitoring of our Plan.  

Vision 

The overall aim of Windsor’s adaptation strategy is to create a more resilient city to the effects of a 
changing climate. A well-adapted city is able to absorb the effects of climate change, such as extreme 
summer heat or intense rain events, through the advancement of sustainable policies, infrastructure 
investment, and public education. This requires forward thinking and initiative. Being prepared to 
handle the climate challenges facing us will be beneficial to our health, our environment and our 
economy.

What is Adaptation? 

Adaptation to climate change includes any activity that reduces the negative impact of climate change 
while taking advantage of new opportunities that may be presented. This type of action differs from 
mitigation as adaptation aims to minimize the actual or expected effects of climate change while 
mitigation is action to reduce the sources of anthropogenic greenhouse gases.  

Why is Adaptation Required? 

The average temperature of the planet has increased by 0.74 °C since 1900.  A similar trend is seen right 
here in the City of Windsor. 

“And  now  our  world  is  different.  The  climate  has  been  permanently  altered  and  is  on  an 
escalating vector of change, not because of what we are going to put into the atmosphere in 
the  future  but  as  a  consequence  of  what  we  have  already  done”.  -  Environmental 
Commissioner of Ontario, 2009/2010 Annual Report. 
 

 
The  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change  (IPCC)  has  concluded  that  the  evidence  for  climate 
change  is  “incontrovertible”  and  that  a  large  part  of  the  ongoing  change  is  due  to  human  activities, 
notably the release of greenhouse gases (GHGs) to the atmosphere.  The Earth’s atmosphere has 38% 
more carbon dioxide (CO2) than it had before the beginning of the industrial erai.   

Regardless of the cause, changes in weather patterns already impose risks to life, property, 
and the natural world in Ontario that cannot be ignored. Reducing those immediate risks is 
the  only  prudent  course  of  action  for  all  levels  of  government,  as  well  as  communities, 
corporations, businesses, and individual citizens.  - Climate Ready Ontario 

 
GHGs released decades ago are a main contributor to the change in our climate today.  That means that 
even if globally, greenhouse gases were eliminated, changes will continue due to what was released in 
the past. 

Public  Safety  Canada  has  been  documenting  “significant  natural  disasters”  for  over  a  century  in  the 
Canadian  Disasters  Database.  A  “significant  disaster”  is  a  disaster  that  meets  one  or  more  of  the 
following criteria: 

  10 or more people killed 
  100 or more people affected/injured/infected/evacuated or homeless 
  An appeal for national/international assistance 
  Historical significance 
 

Significant  damage/interruption  of  normal  processes  such  that  the  community  affected 
cannot recover on its owniv 

Figure 1 below clearly shows the increase in “significant natural disasters” occurring across Canada from 
1900 to 2011.

Climate Change and the Economy 

A recent report “Climate Ready Ontario’s Adaptation Strategy and Action Plan 2011-2014” highlighted 
the economic reality of failing to adapt to climate change.  Based on the Economics of Climate Change 
(2006),  Ontario  could  see  annual  costs  of  about  $5.66  billion  dollars  annually  to  respond  to  extreme 
weather brought  by climate  change.v  For example,  the  Ontario Disaster Relief Assistance Program has 
provided over $60 million since 1998 for flood relief alone in part due to an increase in the number of 
significant  urban  flooding  events,  including  floods  in  Peterborough,  Ottawa,  Sudbury,  Hamilton  and 
Toronto.   

In  2011,  the  National  Round  Table  on  the 
Environment  and  the  Economy  (NRTEE)  published 
their  report  “Paying  the  Price:  The  Economic 
Impacts  of  Climate  Change  for  Canada”.    In  this 
report,  the  NRTEE  expects  the  costs  of  climate 
change to escalate over time from an average of $5 
billion/year  in  2020  to  $21  to  $43  billion/year  by 
2050 depending on global emissions.vi   These costs 
will  not  be  equally  distributed  across  the  country 
with greater costs predicted for some coastal areas.   

At  first  glance,  the  costs  of  adaptation  are  often 
readily identified and dismissed as too expensive by 
many  governments  and  businesses. 
  However,

consideration for the benefits of adaptation both from reducing the impacts of climate change as well as 
the improvement to the baseline risk from the current climate, the adaptation option can often lead to 
great cost savingsvi.   

Municipalities  have  a  significant  role  to  play  in  climate  change  adaptation.    Many  of  the  impacts  of 
climate  change  will  directly  affect  the  services  provided  by  the  City  of  Windsor  and  our  agencies, 
including:    wastewater  and  stormwater  management;  transportation;  parks  and  urban  forests;  social 
services; emergency services; public health; and electricity distribution. 

The  actions  taken  today  by  the  City  of  Windsor  will  enhance  community  resilience  to  climate  change 
with the objective to reduce the human and economic costs of climate-related impacts.   

Windsor’s Changing Climate 

Between 1948 and 2008, the average annual temperature in Ontario has increased by up to 1.4 °C, with 
scientists predicting that by 2050, the average annual temperature in Ontario will increase by 2.5 °C to 
3.7 °C from the 1961-1990 baseline average. 

Annual Average Temperature 

The Environment Canada weather station located at Windsor Airport has been monitoring and recording 
weather data since 1941.  Since this time, the average annual temperature has increased by almost 1 °C.

provides the ability for municipalities to undertake regional modelling on climate change.  The Localizer 
Reports developed by the CCCSN uses an “ensemble” approach, which means that numerous models 
are used to determine projections rather than basing projections on just one model. Comparisons with 
past climate models show that ensemble projections are usually more realistic than any single modelvii. 

Throughout the City of Windsor’s adaptation planning process, two climate change scenarios were 
examined: the high (A2) and the low (B1) emissions scenarios. Each scenario projection is completed as 
an ensemble of over 20 different global climate models. However, it has been noted that the highest 
emissions scenario (A2) is closest to the observed trends with recent data showing climate change is 
advancing more quickly than previously estimated.   

 The following table shows the average annual temperature projections above the baseline period 
(1971-2000) based on the two scenarios. Projections to 2050 are often the most reliable as model 
results begin to diverge after 2050.

2.6 ± 0.5 °C

Though the average projection increase may be perceived as a minor change, it actually can have a 
significant impact on the region.  As figure 4 below indicates a slight increase in the mean average 
temperatures will lead to more ‘hot’ and record ‘hot’ weather with less cold weather.  This shift in the 
average weather for the region allows for the survival of invasive species, the expansion or introduction 
of insect vectors that carry disease, increase in ‘heat alert’ days and increase evaporation of surface 
waters that contribute to an increase of extreme precipitation events.

The City of Windsor was one of a few communities that were selected for analysis of extreme 
temperature.  The temperature projections were completed by the Canadian Regional Climate Model 
(CRCM) developed by the Ouranos Consortium on Regional Climatology and Adaptation to Climate 
Change (Figures 5 and 6). The conclusions of the analysis predict that the number of days over 30oC/86°F 
in Windsor could almost quadruple by 2071–2100 over that experienced prior to 2000.  The number of 
warm nights (over 22oC/72°F) is expected to increase even more dramatically—a tenfold increase by 
2071–2100.viii

Figure 7 highlights the association between all 
non-traumatic daily deaths that occurred from 
June 1 to August 31 from 1986 to 2005 and the 
historical maximum daily temperatures in 
Windsor. There is a strong association between 
temperature and excess mortality in the City of 
Windsor. As the figure shows, at approximately 
29°C/84°F excess mortality begins to increase as 
ambient temperatures increase.ix

As air temperatures increases, so does the capacity of the air to hold more water leading to more 
intense rainfall events.  Since 1970, there has been increasing evidence of heavier short duration (24 
hours or less) rain events in southern Ontario.  The following table summarizes the average trends in the 
amount of annual maximum rain events.

Recent extreme rain intensities in North Toronto 2005,

basin 2004 suggest there may be even more rapid trends 
towards increasing magnitude of heavy rain events in isolated 
storms.   

The City of Windsor has also been experiencing more intense 
rain events including:

November 29th, 2011 alone received 75mm of rain.   

Surface Water Temperatures and Great Lakes Water Levels 

The temperatures of surface waters will continue to rise with the increase in annual temperatures.  This 
increase may allow for the establishment of new invasive species, as well as an increase in algae growth.  
Based on historical temperature monitoring of western Lake Erie, the length of winter (days with water 
temperatures below 4°C) is getting shorterxi.  A loss of ice cover may result in increased erosion of 
shoreline that was typically protected by winter ice.  Open surface water also allows for more 
evaporation. 

 

12 

Climate Change Adaptation Plan  2012 

 
Although most scenarios of future climate projects increases in regional precipitation, the increase in 
evaporation caused by higher temperatures is expected to lead to an overall decrease in the Great Lakes 
System water levels.  Increased evaporation is expected in all seasons, and particularly in winter as a 
result of decreased ice cover on the lakes.  The impacts of lower water levels will be most pronounced in 
parts of the system that are already shallow, specifically western Lake Erie, Lake St. Clair, and the St. 
Clair and Detroit Riversxii. Canadian modelling predicts a significant lowering of lake levels by 2050 as a 
long-term average, with a predicted decline of 0.8 m for Lake Eriex.  

The lowering of water levels in the Great Lakes –St. Lawerence System may impact several sectors as 
identified in the figure below. 

Source: Lemmen and Warren, 2004xi 

 

Figure 10: Potential impacts of lower water levels in the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence. 

 

Some economic losses associated with a decrease in lake levels are easily calculated.  For a 2.5 cm 
lowering of Lakes Michigan-Huron, cargo ships must reduce loads by 90 to 115 tonnes worth 
approximately $25,000 US per tripx.  Based on historical water level changes, it is known that 
hydroelectricity output may be reduced by up to 26% at some stations with lower water levelsxii.

Examples of Climate Change Impacts 

The City of Windsor has already been impacted by the effects of climate change. The figure below 
outlines some of the issues we have already faced and the consequences we have had to deal with. As 
shown, the effects vary across city departments and range from environmental, to economic, to human 
health risks.

What Windsor is Already Doing 

The City of Windsor has already instituted a number of programs that increase the resiliency to potential 
climate change impacts (Figure 12).  Several of these programs were instituted or expanded following 
significant events identified in the previous section.  For example, the downspout disconnection 
program was expanded following the intense rainfall events of 2006, 2007, while the basement flooding 
program was initiated after the 2010 intense rainfall event.

Towards the Development of a Climate Change Plan 

City Council Direction 

On January 23rd 2012, City Council passed a motion approving the development of a corporate wide 
Climate Change Adaptation Plan with a focus on impacts with a medium high – extreme risk rating as 
recommended by the Environment and Transportation Standing Committee (M29-2012). 

Risk is defined as the combination of an event’s likelihood and the severity of its consequences – risk 
therefore equals the probability of projected impact multiplied by the consequence severity of that 
event.  This initiative interpreted the risks levels, broadly speaking, as follows: 

  Extreme risks demand urgent attention at the most senior level and cannot be simply accepted 

as a part of routine operations without executive sanction. 

  High risks are the most severe that can be accepted as part of routine operations without 

executive sanction but they will be the responsibility of the most senior operational 
management and reported upon at the executive level. 

  Medium risks can be expected to form part of routine operations but they will be explicitly 
assigned to relevant managers for actions, maintained under review and reported upon at 
senior management levels. 
Low risks will be maintained under review but it is expected that existing controls will be 
sufficient and no further actions will be required to treat them unless they become more 
severe. 

 

Internal Consultation 

Through consultation with all City departments and some City agencies, a list of over 250 potential 
impacts was realized.  Using the ICLEI climate change adaptation initiative framework, vulnerability and 
risk assessments were completed to give each impact a designated risk level.  

City of Windsor Potential Climate Change Impacts 

Medium High – Extreme Risk Impacts 
The following five potential climate change impacts were rated as posing at least a high risk to our 
municipality. Therefore, the focus of this adaptation plan is on the following impacts: 

1.  Development policies created in the absence of Climate Change considerations may create 

additional vulnerabilities to the impacts of climate change. 
Increase in operating/maintenance demands to deal with climate extremes. 
Increased chance of flooding to basements, roads and other infrastructure. 
Increase in demand to all areas of Operations when responding to an increase in severe storms 
(during and after). 
Increase in public health risks due to extreme heat.

Medium– Low Risk Impacts 
Though the focus of this plan is to minimize medium high - extreme risk impacts, it is important to be 
aware of the other potential impacts discussed during internal consultations. Various adaptation 
measures may provide resiliency for more than one potential impact. Though the majority of the 
potential impacts discussed are negative (table 4), it is important to consider the possible advantages 
that may occur under a changing climate (table 5).

Proposed Adaptation Options 

The table below summarizes our proposed short-term adaptation actions in response to the medium 
high – extreme risks identified above.  The anticipated changes in climate that garnered the most 
concern to the City of Windsor were: increase in precipitation and increase in extreme summer heat 
events. The adaptation actions in Table 6 are divided into sub-categories, based on the type of risk they 
reduce. Many of these short-term actions build on existing programs in recognized areas of 
vulnerability.  Other adaptation options may be fairly new to the City of Windsor, however there is a 
growing level of experience for such actions amongst other municipalities.

Continual Improvement of the Climate Change Plan 

While these short-term actions may help reduce Windsor’s vulnerability to current events and future 
climate change scenarios, the City also needs to develop on-going strategies that will continue to 
address the changing climate over the long-term.  As the science of climate change continues to advance 
and the knowledge outlining the most effective ways to reduce climate change impacts develops, the 
City must continuously look at enhancing the resiliency of the community using the best available 
knowledge.  The following strategies should be undertaken to ensure that the City of Windsor continues 
to be a leader on adaptation well into the future: 

Incorporate climate change adaptation into city policies and high level plans; 

1. 
2.  Create internal mechanisms to ‘ask the climate question’ for new major infrastructure projects; 
3.  Monitor climate change, evaluate the effectiveness of adaptation strategies and adjust as 

needed (adaptive management); 

4.  Use best available science to analyze how the climate is changing locally and how this may 

impact the community; 

5.  Routinely review the City of Windsor’s vulnerability to climate change; 
6.  Continuously conduct risk assessments to identify priority impacts requiring adaptation actions,  
7.  Engage the public, business and other stakeholder groups. 

Conclusion 

As stated in the City of Windsor’s Environmental Master Plan, “The City of Windsor is committed to 
being a leader through its daily actions and services to enhance the environment for present and future 
generations”.  This is shown through the commitment of City Council and City administration on the 
development of this Climate Change Adaptation Plan.  As one of the first municipalities in Ontario and 
Canada to undergo adaptation planning, Windsor has committed to building a more resilient and livable 
community. 

This adaptation plan is not the end of the climate change discussion.  As highlighted in this report, the 
City of Windsor must continue to review the science and risks associated with the potential impacts of 
climate change and modify the plan as required.  In addition, the creation of this adaptation plan does 
not negate the necessity of developing and implementing a climate change mitigation plan.  The 
mitigation of greenhouse gases is still required to minimize the extent of future climate change impacts.
