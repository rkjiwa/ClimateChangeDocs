Introduction and Application of This Document 

General 
This document provides guidelines for the management of lands that are exposed to coastal flood 
hazards  arising  from  their  exposure  to  the  sea  and  to  expected  sea  level  rise  due  to  climate 
change. 
This document will supersede the related sections of the existing “Land Use Guidelines 2004”, 
which means the Flood Hazard Area Land Use Management Guidelines, May 2004, prepared by 
the Ministry of Water, Land and Air Protection (now Ministry of Environment). 
The  existing  document  is  focussed  primarily  on  river  flood  risks  and  the  existing  section  on 
exposure to flooding by the sea (Section 3.5) is essentially based on the historical slow rise in sea 
level  on  the  coastlines  of  BC  over  the  last  century.    Recent  and  future  sea  level  rise  is  now 
understood to be occurring at faster rates and in the future is anticipated to be rising at a rate that 
is approximately 10 times faster than the historical rate. 
This  document  provides  guidelines  intended  to  help  local  governments,  land-use  managers  and 
approving  officers  develop  and  implement  land-use  management  plans  and  make  subdivision 
approval decisions for lands exposed to coastal flooding hazards and Sea Level Rise (SLR). 
The  Sea  Level  Rise  (SLR)  projections  and  potential  responses  considered  in  this  document  are 
drawn from the Policy Discussion Paper 20101. 
Current  BC  guidelines  require  flood-proofing  behind  dikes  (i.e.  raising  the  habitable  areas  of 
buildings to the Flood Construction Level); however, where sea dikes are upgraded to new design 
guidelines,  as  defined  in  the  companion  document “Sea Dike Guidelines 2010”  2,  relaxation  of 
flood-proofing guidelines may be considered. The relaxed flood-proofing must be compatible with 
the design of the sea dikes. 
This document, and the companion document “Sea Dike Guidelines 2010” 2 are specific to flood 
hazards  arising  from  the  exposure  of  BC  lands  to  the  sea.  In  some  locations,  specifically  river 
estuaries, the lands will also be exposed to other sources of flooding. These new documents are 
companion  documents  to  the  existing  guideline  documents  which  still  address  flooding  hazards 
from rivers.  Analysis of flooding hazards from all sources – rivers and the sea - will be required in 
estuaries.

Background 

Scope 
This guideline document describes the principles for determining the exposure of low lying lands to 
a flooding hazard due to their exposure to the sea and provides guidelines and direction for their 
management.

2.4 

A  national  standard  or  guideline  for  the  management  of  lands  exposed  to  coastal  flood  hazards 
does  not  exist.    This  document  is  intended  to  provide  guidance  for  coastal  exposure  in  British 
Columbia. 

Definitions 
A summary of definitions and terminology used in this document is provided in Appendix A. 
Where possible the same terminology and definitions as used in the existing document; Land Use 
Guidelines 20043 are used; however, as the existing terminology and definitions sometimes need 
modification, clarification or expansion to be appropriate for coastal conditions, in some cases new 
or  revised  terminology  and  definitions  are  proposed.    It  is  recommended  that  the  reader  of  the 
updated  documents  familiarize  themselves  with  the  updated  terminology  and  definitions  in 
Appendix A as necessary. 

Updated Definitions 
In the existing documents the definition of the management parameters; Flood Construction Level 
(FCL) and Setback, is based on the defined location of the Natural Boundary – a position defined in 
law, and in the existing definitions, but which has a tenuous technical basis. The Natural Boundary 
is  a  position  that  can  be  identified  on  an  existing  shoreline  as  indicated  in  Figure  2-1.  It  is  not 
possible to identify the Natural Boundary for a future higher water level. Further background and 
discussion is provided in Appendix B. 
A brief summary of necessary changes is provided below and is summarized in Figure 2-2. 
In  general  terms  the  reference  point  for  the  FCL  and  for  the  Setback  becomes  centred  on  an 
estimated location for a future Natural Boundary, the location of which will change over time as sea 
level rises.  The reference point can be estimated by defining: 

1.  The Designated Flood Level (as indicated in Figure 2-2) 
2.  An estimated future Natural Boundary location (as indicated in Figure 2-2): 

The Designated Flood Level is defined as: 
 

 

 

Designated Flood Level (DFL)  = 

Future SLR Allowance 
+ Maximum High Tide (HHWLT) 
+ Total Storm Surge during Designated Storm 

                                                      

3 “Land Use Guidelines 2004” means the Flood Hazard Area Land Use Management Guidelines, May 2004, 
prepared by the Ministry of Water, Land and Air Protection.

The expected location of the future Natural Boundary is then defined by estimating the additional 
influence  of  waves  and  their  effect  on  the  slowly  changing  shoreline.    The  elevation  of  this 
reference point, defined as the Flood Construction Reference Plane (FCRP), Figure 2-2, is defined 
as: 
Flood Construction Reference Plane (FCRP)  =  Designated Flood Level (DFL) 
 
 
The Estimated Wave Effect can be defined to be 50 per cent of the calculated Wave Run-up on the 
estimated  future  shoreline.    This  percentage  is  based  on  an  analysis  of  existing  data  (2010), 
described  below,  and  may  be  revised  as  more  information,  including  site  specific  surveys  or 
detailed engineering investigations undertaken by qualified professionals, becomes available. 
The role of the existing legal Natural Boundary is preserved for defining the Sea Level Planning 
Area, as also indicated in Figure 2-2. 
The  Flood  Construction  Level  (FCL),  which  will  also  vary  for  a  both  a  given  target  year,  and  a 
specific area, is defined as: 
 

+ Estimated Wave Effect 

Flood Construction Level = FCRP + Freeboard 

 
The Freeboard allowance should be the greater of: 
  0.6m, or; 
  For flood proofing fill – the crest elevation of an equivalent sea dike (see Sea Dike Guidelines 

2010) 

  For exposed vertical building foundations – the wave-structure interaction; 
  For tsunami areas – the runup elevation of the appropriate tsunami hazard. 
 
Setbacks remain essentially unchanged. 
Further  details  of  the  basis  and  relationship  between  the  Existing  Definitions  and  the  Updated 
Definitions are provided in Appendix B.

3.1 

Climate Change Impacts on Coastal Land Use Management 
This  section  is  a  summary  of  more  detailed  information  provided  in  the  companion  Policy 
Discussion  Paper  20101,  and  provides  a  background  for  management  of  land  use,  building 
elevations and related planning and approvals processes in areas that are at risk of flooding from 
the sea. 

Incremental Sea Level Rise 
Sea Level Rise is predicted to be moderate in the period from 2010 to 2025. However, the rate is 
predicted to increase more quickly in the period leading up to 2100, and then continue to increase 
steadily.  For the purpose of this document the current definition of the expected Sea Level Rise is 
provided  in  Figure  3-1.    The  basis  for  this  definition  is  provided  in  the  policy  document:  Policy 
Discussion Paper 20101. 
 

 

 

Figure 3-1: Projections of Global Sea Level Rise 

 

Figure 3-1 illustrates the range of uncertainty in projections, showing a median projection, as well 
as a range in projections from low to high. The uncertainty increases into the future. To protect the 
large  investment  that  buildings  involve,  and  respecting  current  trends  in  SLR,  a  precautionary 
principle is followed to create the Recommended Curve for Sea Level Rise Policy in BC.  As new 
SLR  predictions  become  available  with more  accuracy,  allowances  for  SLR  in  coastal  BC  areas 
may be adjusted, up or down, reflected in a change to these guidelines in the future. 
The  combination  of  certain  sea  level  change  -  but  at  an  uncertain  rate  into  the  future  -  creates 
complexity for the determination of Designated Flood Level (DFL) and related Flood Construction 
Level (FCL).

Both DFL and FCL will need to change over time as sea level rise continues. The pace of sea level 
rise and the arrival of more accurate projections will inform how often a revision to FCLs needs to 
take place. Given current information, a review in five years, and then again by 2025, as well as at 
least once every 25 years thereafter, is warranted. 
Building Life Cycle and Sea Level Rise 

3.2 

In considering FCL in the face of an evolving sea level, it is necessary to consider the longevity of 
the buildings, structures or land use under consideration. A range of 50 to 100 years of practical 
service life is expected for most buildings, although some building life may extend well beyond that 
lifespan. Given the prospect of rising sea level, it is necessary to establish a FCL that anticipates a 
flood level applicable to the end of the lifespan of the proposed building. 
Figure 3-2 illustrates how planning for the 100 year lifespan of a structure or land use brings future 
SLR  increases  into  immediate  focus.  The  graphic  illustrates,  in  100  year  steps,  how  building 
elevations may need to be incrementally adjusted higher to accommodate gradual SLR. 

 

Figure 3-2: Incremental Sea Level Rise Effect on Planning for 100 Year Life Structures 

 

For  land  use  management  guidance  in  BC,  allowances  for  Sea  Level  Rise  until  the  Year  2100 
should be used in current planning and building approvals. 
This guideline should apply for the period from 2010 until the next SLR review, which should be 
completed by 2015. 
Figure 3-2 shows how high SLR projections could affect a building that has an expected lifespan 
extending  to  the  Year  2100.  An  allowance  of  1.0  m  of  SLR  plus  or  minus  regional  effects  (e.g. 
crustal uplift or subsidence) could be required. Figure 3-2 also extends the allowance out to the 
Year  2200,  indicating  that  an  additional  SLR  of  approximately  1.0  m,  for  a  total  allowance  of 
approximately 2.0 m, can be expected over the 200 year period. 
SLR  over  the  next  centuries  will  continue  to  increase  the  pressure  for  ever  higher  building 
elevations to adapt to the risk of flooding from the sea.

3.3 

Sea Level Rise and Building Flood Construction Level 
In  coastal  areas,  calculation  of  the  Flood  Construction  Reference  Plane  (FCRP)  and  a  Flood 
Construction Level (FCL) that reflects expected SLR is complex, and will vary depending on the 
local tide conditions, shoreline orientation and exposure and other factors that change allowances 
for local storm surge and wave effects. 
An  example  of  the  calculation  of  the  FCL  for  an  exposed  location  at  Victoria,  where  a  recent 
surveyed elevation of a present Natural Boundary is available, is provided in Table 3-1, based on 
the  existing  guidelines;  Land  Use  Guidelines  20043,  and  for  these  updated  guidelines,  for 
application up to the years 2100 and 2200.  
 ‘Guideline’ provides recommended values for current planning for the BC Coast for the indicated 
years as indicated in Figure 3-1. ‘Possible’ represents the highest potential values as defined in 
the  companion  “Policy Discussion Paper 2010”1  and  indicated by  the  upper  envelope curve  in 
Figure 3-1.  The “Possible” scenario is only included to illustrate the potential implication of the 
present upper bound of all global scenarios. 
The updated estimate for 2010 in Table 3-1 shows that the change from relying on the elevation of 
the present Natural Boundary to one which is based on expected water levels makes no significant 
difference to the estimation of a FCL for 2010.  The results in Table 3-1 also show that planning 
today  for  a  FCL  of  5.9  m  CGD  essentially  means  that  anticipation  of  an  extreme  SLR  by  2100 
simply provides an allowance that may provide protection until the year 2200, depending on actual 
SLR. 
Table  3-2 provides preliminary  FCRPs  and  FCLs  for  various areas  of  the  BC  coast  for  the  year 
2100, based on the Recommended Sea Level Rise Curve in Figure 3-1 and annual exceedence 
probabilities (AEP) defined in the companion document Policy Discussion Paper 20101.  It should 
be noted that these preliminary values should vary due to a number of factors that are site specific, 
including:  the  local  rate  of  crustal  uplift  or  subsidence,  the  nature  of  the  tides,  anticipated  local 
storm surge effects that depend on local bathymetry and the particulars of the anticipated storms 
associated  with  the storm surge.   The preliminary  values  provided  in Table  3-2  are  provided  for 
guidance.  Further analysis is required to provide FCRPs and FCLs for specific sites. 
SLR  Planning  Areas  should  be  established  along  the  BC  Coast  to  provide  a  basis  for  local 
calculations  and  guidance  on  required  Flood  Construction  Levels,  and  to  provide  a  basis  for 
management  of  the  expected  ongoing  increases  in  SLR  as  it  affects  land  use  and  buildings. 
Proposed terms of reference for SLR Planning Areas are introduced in Section 4

Adaptive Risk Management in the Face of Uncertainty 
To provide balance between economic development objectives and the precautionary principle, an 
Adaptive Risk Management approach to Sea Level Rise is warranted.  
Land  use  and  building  approvals  based  on  FCL  for  2100  should  also  include  provisions  for 
adaptive management of land uses to Sea Level Rise to the Year 2200 and beyond. The long term 
view should also apply when approval of a lot parcel or a building implies a change (increase) in 
the intensity of land use that extends beyond the life of building. 
An  Adaptive  Risk  Management  Approach  to  SLR  would  plan  how  short  term  land  uses  and 
structures can be occupied with reasonable risk for their lifespan, but at the same time recognize 
and allow that future SLR may require the redesign to a higher elevation or relocation of the next 
generation of land uses and structures at a given coastal site.

The FCL and Setback for a given site may vary at the point that a building has ended its planned 
lifespan.  
For  example,  a  building constructed  in  2010 with  a  90  year  lifespan would  meet  the  guideline  if 
sited  to  allow  for  SLR  of  1.0  m  minimum  over  Year  2000  levels  plus  or  minus  any  regional 
adjustments. When rebuilt in or about 2100 this building would need to accommodate FCL at the 
time, which might be 2.0m higher than Year 2000 levels, requiring that the building FCL be 1.0 m 
higher than approved in 2010. The actual required FCL in the year 2200 will not be known with 
accuracy until much closer to that date. 
In  the  building  example  above,  there  is  ongoing  economic  use,  with  the  costs  of  adaptation 
distributed through the centuries. 
This approach will minimize the initial costs of considering SLR, and the future costs of adaptation. 
Beyond examples of individual buildings, the SLR Planning Area approach described in Section 4 
provides a method to gradually adapt larger scale land use patterns to SLR including impacts on 
drainage, access and other factors affecting the land use.

4.1 

Sea Level Rise (SLR) Planning Areas 
SLR  creates  serious  risks  for  public  health  and  property  in  lowlands  on  the  BC  coast.  It  is 
necessary to minimize the risk and costs of SLR, to both public and private interests, by proactive 
planning  for  future  land  use.  SLR  Planning  Areas  should  be  defined  for  both  settled  and  new 
development areas that are at risk of SLR inundation or related erosion.  

Extent of SLR Planning Area 
This  section  describes  how  to  determine  the  extent  of  SLR  Planning  Areas,  and  introduces  the 
proposed scope of planning. 
Figure 4-1 illustrates in concept the proposed SLR Planning Areas. They would extend from the 
existing  Natural  Boundary  of  the  sea  landward  to  the  contour  elevation  of  a  future  Flood 
Construction Level (FCL). Each SLR Planning Area would have two parts: 
  SLR Planning Area Year 2100 would extend from Natural Boundary at the sea to the guideline 

FCL elevation projected for Year 2100. 

  SLR Planning Area Year 2200 would extend from Natural Boundary at the sea to the guideline 

FCL elevation projected for Year 2200. 

For the purposes of determining the extent of SLR Planning Areas, the presence of existing sea 
dikes or coastal defences should be ignored.  However, if the Management Option selected for the 
Area  is  to  protect  the  Area  in  perpetuity  with  sea  dikes,  then  the  design  of  the  dikes  should  be 
considered  in  the  determination  of  appropriate  FCLs.    Land  use  policies  must  then  address  the 
land needs required to upgrade the existing sea dikes. 
Flood  Construction  Levels  for  SLR  Planning  Areas  should  be  calculated  specific  to  the  local 
conditions  of  shoreline  terrain  and  vegetation,  tides,  wind  fetch  and  upland  topography.  Each 
location may have a different allowance for High Tide, Sea Level Rise, Storm Surge, and Wave 
Effects which together with Freeboard determine the FCL. 
Planning policy and land use designations within the SLR Planning Area must consider how land 
uses can adapt to the projected future Flood Construction Levels.

Scope of SLR Planning 
Scope of SLR Planning Area analysis, for both Year 2100 and Year 2200: 
  Calculate  local  anticipated  values  of  High  Tide  Level,  Total  Storm  Surge  and  Wave  Effects, 

and determine resulting FCL including Freeboard; 
Interpret approximate related location of the Estimated Future Natural Boundary; 

 
  Establish a Setback line, shown as the greater of 15m from Estimated Future Natural Boundary 
or the Contour of the Future FCL; with consideration of potential shoreline erosion or accretion 
given  the  shoreline  characteristics.  It  is  the  intent  that  all  new  buildings  are  provided  a  15m 
setback,  to  protect  from  wave  and  related  splash  impacts  on  buildings  which  may  be  an 
increased risk due to SLR; 

Scope of SLR Planning Area objectives, policies and guidelines,  
 

for the SLR Planning Area Yr 2100: 
o  Establish  requirements  for  new  buildings  to  meet  FCL  and  Setbacks  in  accordance  with 
Provincial Guidelines, or to meet flood protection requirements as established by Qualified 
Professionals.  Written  design  and  construction  standards  from  Qualified  Professionals 
should be required for any variance to setbacks at the sea or coastal bluffs; 
Identify adaptation measures for existing buildings, including approaches to minimize the 
impacts  of  flooding  from  the  sea  and  provisions  for  evacuation  during  extreme  storm 
events; 
In consideration of zoning or rezoning applications; encourage or permit land uses that are 
compatible with coastal flooding risks; 

o 

o 

o  Provide  guidelines  for  land  use  practices  that  minimize  the  impacts  of  flooding  on  high 

value economic and environmental assets.

o  Require covenants on title of new buildings or properties to require buildings and land uses 

to adapt to future SLR and FCL requirements. 

 

for the SLR Planning Area Yr 2200: 
o 

Identify strategies on how proposed land uses and buildings can be adapted to guideline 
SLR, FCL and Setbacks that might occur in the Year 2200. 

SLR Planning Area strategies may also include planning dates in addition to Year 2100 and 2200. 
For instance, existing buildings may have a lifespan that expires in about 2050, and the planning 
authority  may  deem  it  relevant  to  project  requirements  to  building  reconstruction  at  that  date  – 
perhaps by planning for FCL and Setback requirements for new buildings with a lifespan to Year 
2150. 
Some building uses may have a lifespan of shorter than 100 years. With assistance by Qualified 
Professionals, it is appropriate to consider whether these shorter lifespans could be considered for 
reduced  approval  requirements.  However,  approving  officials  are  cautioned  in  these  cases  to 
ensure that proponents plan and covenant for adaptation of the next generation of buildings and 
land uses on the site to SLR at the Year 2100 and Year 2200 or other appropriate thresholds. 
It  is  recommended  that  SLR  projections  and  related  FCL  requirements  should  be  reviewed  in  5 
years  time  (Year  2015)  as  well  as  Year  2025  and  every  25  years  after  that  at  a  minimum.  The 
guidelines  and  requirements  in  SLR  Planning  Areas  will  need  to  be  reviewed  in  these  same 
intervals, with a focus on updating FCL elevation requirements, which may move up or down as 
projections for SLR become more accurate. 
The term of SLR Plans will also move with the review intervals – with the general intent that SLR 
planning looks ahead approximately 100 and 200 years from the date of the plan. For example, in 
the  Year  2050  the  SLR  Planning  Area  boundaries  (FCL  contours)  may  reflect  Years  2150  and 
2250. 
Building Setbacks from the Sea 

In un-diked areas, SLR will have the long-term effect of moving the Natural Boundary landward. 
This effect will be more pronounced on gently sloping shorelines or low coastal benches than in 
steeper  shoreline  terrain  or  where  bedrock  is  present.    Coastal  Bluffs  will  require  special 
consideration. 
Sea Level Rise may increase the risk of coastal erosion and accelerate the retreat of shorelines. 
Higher risks will occur on sandy shorelines, with moderate risks at gravel or estuarine settings. The 
changes  in  risk  will relate to  increased frequency of wave action at  shorelines  and  at  the  toe  of 
related  slopes  or  bluffs.  The  rate  of  retreat  will  be  highly  dependent  on  the  wind  and  wave 
characteristics at the site and the material of the shoreline and backshore bluffs. 
Where lands are to remain un-diked, setbacks for buildings from the sea must anticipate SLR for 
the lifespan of the building. 
Figure 4-4 illustrates SLR to the Year 2100 in a relatively flat and rolling shoreline condition. SLR 
will increase the elevation of High Tide, and with storm surge, wave effects and freeboard added, 
the cumulative effect is to increase the Flood Construction Level (FCL) by an amount related to 
SLR and the local storm exposure. This increase in sea level and wave runup will gradually move 
the Natural Boundary to a higher level. 
Building  Setback  should  be  established  as  ‘the  greater  of  15  m  from  the  future  Estimated 
Natural  Boundary  or  a  distance  to  where  the  native  land  elevation  equals  the  Flood 
Construction  Level’.  This  setback  would  apply  to  non-erodible  bedrock  cliffs  as  well  as  other 
shoreline types. In cases of coastal bluffs, greater setbacks would apply, consistent with the Land 
Use Guidelines 2004.

In  Figure  4-4,  the  steep  future  shoreline  means  that  the  15m  minimum  setback  from  Natural 
Boundary supersedes the FCL contour elevation. 
In Figure 4-5, which illustrates the Year 2200 projected condition, additional SLR has moved the 
future  Natural  Boundary  further  inland,  and  combined  with  the  increase  in  FCL  has  made  the 
building constructed in 2010 not fully protected from the sea. The building is also likely to be at the 
end  of  its  lifespan  around  2100.  Rebuilding  on  or  after  2100  should  undertake  a  MANAGED 
RETREAT, and respect the Year 2200 FCL and Setback. 
If rebuilding is not proposed, the building will be at risk. Short of relocating the building, preparing 
the  lower  parts  of  the  building  to  ACCOMODATE  flooding  from  the  sea  should  be  required  – 
through such measures as leaving only floodable uses such as parking on the lower floor, moving 
habitable quarters to the upper floor, or using water resistant materials on the lower floor.

4.4 

Land Use Planning Strategies  

 

Beyond concerns about individual buildings, the long-term nature of SLR provides an opportunity to 
minimize risks and impacts by land use planning strategies. 
During planning for land use and development, careful mapping and planning strategies for SLR 
Planning  Areas  will  minimize  costs  and  hazards  for  both  the  public  and  private  landowners  / 
insurers. 
Figure  4-6  introduces  in  plan  view,  the  concept  that  a  SLR  Planning  Area  extent  varies  with 
shoreline  and  backshore  terrain.  Where  shorelines  are  relatively  steep  and  rocky,  typical  of 
bedrock points of land, the minimum 15m setback combined with a steep slope would mean the 
areal extent of SLR will be limited. In shoreline areas where gentle beaches, beach dunes and flat 
or rolling backshores exist, SLR impact could affect a considerable land area. A first step in land 
use planning for SLR is to establish the future FCL allowances for Year 2100 and 2200, and map 
the associated FCL lines on detailed contour maps. The SLR Planning Area lines will be, in effect, 
contour lines representing allowances for the FCL levels in Year 2100 and Year 2200. 
Figure 4-7 shows typical planning responses, at the land use level, to risks of SLR in areas that will 
not be diked. An initial response should be to concentrate development outside the SLR Planning 
Area, to AVOID risks associated with SLR. 
Increases in SLR will gradually move the natural boundary landward. Land use in the area that will 
be  inundated  in  the  future  should  be  managed  to  adjust  to  the  change  in  shoreline  and  to  the 
increased risk of sea flooding during the Designated Storm. Uses such as agriculture, parks, open 
space and limited industrial or short-term uses would be preferred. 
In  cases  of  estuarine  or  coastal  wetlands,  the  zone  of  wetlands  may  tend  to  move  shoreward. 
Where coastal defences or existing rock geology stops the shoreline from moving, intertidal areas

and  their  associated  ecosystems  are  at  risk  of  being  ‘squeezed  out’4.    SLR  Planning  should 
consider what areas of land should be set aside to allow migration of coastal ecosystems, or to 
support ecosystem restoration or habitat banking.  
SLR  Planning  Areas,  or  applicant  supported  studies  by  Qualified  Professionals,  should  also  be 
used to customize building “setback” based on coastal risk assessments that consider how SLR 
combined with wave action and coastal geomorphology may alter shoreline locations, shape and 
backshore erosion. Guidelines for location of buildings should be based on these planning studies 
and the expected life of the at-risk asset. 
Salinization  of  surface  freshwater  and  groundwater  may  also  increase  in  shoreline  areas, 
potentially affecting both ecosystems and drinking water supplies from coastal wells. SLR Planning 
should  consider  how  to  mitigate  the  impacts  of  salinization.  Drainage  may  also  be  impeded  by 
higher groundwater levels. 
Land managers may decide to PROTECT some parts of a SLR Planning Area by building a new 
dike or placing landfill to meet FCLs. If dikes are used as protection, such areas must meet the 
requirements of the “Sea Dike Guidelines 2010”.

Figure 4-7: Concept Plan of Typical Planning Responses to SLR  

 

For ease of land use planning administration within SLR Planning Areas, planning authorities may 
find it useful to establish ‘areas’ of similar planned structure lifespan, as opposed to allowing a mix 
of  buildings  with  short,  medium  and  long-term  lifespans  in  a  small  area.  Note,  however,  this 
requirement  is  not  intended  to  discourage  mixed  land  use  communities.  With  new  legislative 
support, a building lifespan requirement could be an added clause to a Development Permit Area 
or a Zoning Bylaw. Associated with the planned structure lifespan would be a FCL and shoreline 
setback. A covenant on title would provide legal notice that the FCL and setback rules may change 
for reconstruction at the end of the structure lifespan period. 
However, the recommended planning approach is to set FCL based on a precautionary principle 
and a reasonably long building lifespan (i.e.100 years), and then allow those applicants that need 
to challenge these FCLs to commission studies by a qualified professional to consider the science 
and  site  conditions  and  recommend  a  site-specific  and  structure-specific  FCL.  This  approach  is 
similar to that used in the BC Riparian Area Regulation.  In these cases a covenant on title would 
provide notice on the allowances and restrictions on the land use and structure use, and would give 
notice  that  future  FCL  levels  may  vary  depending  on  future  SLR  projections  and  the  lifespan  of 
future buildings. 
In the meantime until SLR Planning Areas are defined, local governments could consider adding 
requirements to development information statutes stating that applicants proposing to construct at 
elevations below those outlined in Table 3-2 provide Qualified Professional expertise to determine 
appropriate flood protection in keeping with the 2010 Guidelines. This would be an interim measure 
only until more cost-efficient neighbourhood scale SLR Planning could be done.

Planning Response 

  No constraints on planning due to flood risk 

Low to medium risk areas: 
e.g.: SLR Planning Areas for 

Year 2200 

  Not usually necessary to consider flood risk unless local conditions 

indicate otherwise. Suitable for development other than essential 
services.  

  A flood risk assessment may be required at upper end of the 

probability range (0.5% or 200 year average return period) or where 
the nature of the development or the local circumstances indicates 
heightened risk. Water-resistant materials and construction may be 
required.  

  Generally not suitable for essential civil infrastructure/services such 
as hospitals, fire stations, emergency depots. Where such services 
or infrastructure have to be located in these areas or they are being 
substantially expanded or upgraded, they must be capable of 
remaining operational and accessible during extreme flooding 
events. 

 

 

Medium to high risk areas: 
e.g.: SLR Planning Areas for 

Year 2100 

 

  Generally not suitable for essential infrastructure such as hospitals, 

fire stations, emergency depots, schools, ground-based electrical 
and telecommunications equipment.  Flood proofing may be 
acceptable. 
In areas already built up: May be suitable for residential, institutional, 
commercial and industrial development, provided flood prevention 
measures to the appropriate standard already exist, are under 
construction, or are planned as part of a long-term development 
strategy. In allocating sites, preference should be given to those 
areas already defended to that standard. Use water-resistant 
materials and construction as appropriate.  
In undeveloped and sparsely populated areas: Generally not suitable 
for additional development of any type. Exceptions may arise if a 
location is essential for operational reasons; e.g., for navigation and 
water-based recreation uses, agriculture, transport or some utilities 
infrastructure, and an alternative lower-risk location is not 
achievable. Such infrastructure should be designed and constructed 
to remain operational during floods. 

  May be suitable for some recreation, sport, amenity and nature 

conservation uses provided adequate evacuation procedures are in 
place. Job-related accommodation (e.g., caretakers and operational 
staff) may be acceptable. New trailer or mobile home should 
generally not be located in these areas. 
If built development is permitted, flood prevention and alleviation 
measures are required and the loss of storage capacity minimised. 
Water-resistant materials and construction as appropriate.  
Land should not be developed if it will be needed or have significant 
potential for coastal managed realignment (retreat) or creation of 
wetlands as part of an overall flood defence.

Community/Land Use Planning and Hazard Management 
Climate Change literature often refers to four main strategies to manage SLR: 
  Avoid 
  Protect 
  Accommodate 
  Retreat. 
Each  of  these  strategies has  been named  in  prior examples.  For  a  more  in-depth  description  of 
each of these strategies, refer to the “Policy Discussion Document 2010”.  

Land Use Management Tools 
Tools that local governments can use to apply one or more of the land use strategies discussed in 
this chapter include: 
  Official Community Plans - hazard land identification and SLR Planning Area designation, 
  Zoning bylaws – “risk zoning”, as discussed above.  
  S 910 Flood Plain Bylaw 
  OCP Development  Permit  Area  for  Protection  of Development  from  Hazardous  Conditions – 

guidelines and requirements for developing in hazard areas. 

  Restrictive covenants. 
  Public education – about the hazards and ways that individuals can address them. 
  Early warning and emergency preparedness programs. 
Requirements  for  FCL  and  Setback  in  the  planning  documents  would  vary  periodically  in 
accordance with an Adaptive Risk Management approach – establishing new levels as Sea Level 
Rise projections become more defined.

On-Going Guidance 
Examples  of  different  methods  of  adapting  to  SLR  in  southern  BC  are  under  development  by  a 
parallel project also sponsored by the Natural Resources Canada Regional Adaption Collaborative 
(RAC)5.

Application to Lands Subject to Future Flooding 
This section applies to land uses that are not protected by Standard Dikes. In areas protected by 
sea dikes that meet BCMOE requirements, FCLs may not apply and land use behind those sea 
dikes may not be restricted. Building setbacks will be required on the landside of dikes as needed 
for dike maintenance and to provide land for future dike raising and reconstruction. 
Sea  Level  Rise  will  create  an  increasing  risk  of  periodic  inundation  to  existing  low  lying 
undeveloped lands along the BC Coast and in lower reaches of river deltas near the Coast. 
These  guidelines  are  not  meant  to  preclude  the  use  of  these  lands  or  of  existing  structures  on 
these 
that  development  of  new  structures  or 
redevelopment/replacement of existing structures recognizes and can appropriately accommodate 
the projected impacts of sea level rise on coastal hazards and flooding over time.  

lands.  The  goal 

is 

to  ensure 

General Guidelines - FCL and Setback 
The FCL shall be established for specific coastal areas during the SLR Planning Areas process. 
FCL shall be a minimum elevation for habitable floor level or underside of wood construction, and 
shall  be  based  on  and  include  allowances  for  Year  2100  SLR  and  High  Tide  levels,  associated 
storm surge and wave effects for the Designated Storm, and Freeboard. 
Building Setback shall be the greater of 15m from the future Estimated Natural Boundary of the sea 
at Year 2100, or a horizontal distance until the natural ground elevation contour reaches the Year 
2100 projected FCL. Landfill or structural support (e.g. pilings) for a coastal development shall be 
treated as a Dike structure – refer to the “Sea Dike Guidelines 2010” for guidance.  

Subdivision of Undeveloped Lands 
All  lots  created  through  subdivision  shall  comply  with  the  general  FCL  and  Setback  guidelines 
noted above. 
To regulate redevelopment at the end of the building lifespan, the development approving official 
shall require a restrictive covenant stipulation of reconstruction requirements to meet the FCL and 
setbacks in force at the time of redevelopment, and identifying the hazard, building requirements, 
and liability disclaimer if reconstruction does not take place at or before the planned lifespan of the 
building. 

Development on Existing Undeveloped Lots 
On existing lots, if meeting the guidelines noted above would sterilize the lot (i.e., not allow even 
one of the land uses or structures permitted under the current zoning), the development approving 
official may agree to modifying setback requirements as recommended by a Qualified Professional, 
provided  this  is  augmented  through  a  restrictive  covenant  stipulation  of  the  hazard,  building 
requirements, and liability disclaimer. 

Lots with Coastal Bluffs 
 
For lots containing coastal bluffs that are steeper than 3(H):1(V) and susceptible to erosion from 
the sea, setbacks shall be determined as follows:

6.6 

If the future estimated Natural Boundary is located at least 15m seaward of the toe of the bluff, then 
no action is required and the setback shall conform with guidelines suitable to terrestrial cliff 
hazards. 
If the future estimated Natural Boundary is located 15m or less seaward of the toe of the bluff, then 
the setback from the future estimated Natural Boundary will be located at a horizontal distance of at 
least 3 times the height of the bluff, measured from 15m landwards from the location of the future 
estimated  Natural Boundary. 
In some conditions, setbacks may require site-specific interpretation and could result in the use of a 
minimum distance measured back from the crest of the bluff.  The setback may be modified 
provided the modification is supported by a report, giving consideration to the coastal erosion that 
may occur over the life of the project, prepared by a suitably qualified professional. 
Outside the Strait of Georgia, setback requirements would be similar but should be adapted to 
include tsunami effects.  Land use specific provisions in the existing guidelines would still apply.  
 
Renovations or Additions to Existing Buildings  

Renovations  to  existing  buildings  within  the  existing  footprint  of  the  building  are  not  affected  by 
these guidelines. 
Additions of up to 25% of the floor area, at the elevation of the existing building can be allowed, 
provided that the addition is no closer to the existing natural boundary than the existing building. 
Reconstruction of Existing Buildings  

Replacement or redevelopment of a building on an existing low lying lot must meet the new FCL 
and Setback guidelines. If meeting the new guidelines would sterilize the lot (i.e., not allow even 
one of the land uses or structures permitted under the current zoning), the development approving 
official may agree to modifying setback requirements as recommended by a Qualified Professional, 
provided  this  is  augmented  through  a  restrictive  covenant  stipulation  of  the  hazard,  building 
requirements, and liability disclaimer. 
Outside of the Strait of Georgia the requirements would be similar but adapted to include Tsunami 
considerations and a 30m minimum setback. Land Use Specific provisions in the existing guideline 
would still apply.

Definitions 
The  incorporation  of  climate  change  related  sea  level  rise  considerations  into  existing  BC 
Ministry of Environment documents is structured into three documents: 
  Draft Policy Discussion Paper 2010 
  Sea Dike Guidelines 2010 
  Guidelines for Management of Coastal Flood Hazard Land Use 2010. 
The  definitions  in  these  documents  follow,  where  possible,  the  definitions  and  terminology 
that  are  either  consistent  with  the  existing  documents  or  consistent  with  existing  practise 
worldwide.    In  some  cases  existing  definitions  or  terminology  require  modification  or 
clarification  for  application  to  coastal  flooding  or  sea  dike  application  in  a  climate  change 
driven sea level rise scenario. 
Existing  definitions  are  provided  below  in  italics  followed  by  any  necessary  modification, 
clarification or addition to the definitions or terminology in the existing documents. 
Acronyms associated with the definitions that are used in the text are shown in brackets. 

1.1  Annual Exceedence Probability (AEP) 
The  probability,  likelihood  or  chance  of  a  particular  event  (e.g.,  a  storm  or  a  storm  surge) 
being equalled or exceeded in any one year.  It is defined either as a number between 0 and 
1 or as a corresponding percentage. 
An  AEP  of  0.01  means  there  is  a 1% chance  of an  event,  of  a given  magnitude or  larger, 
occurring in any single given year. An AEP of 0.01 or 1/100 yr also suggests that on average, 
under certain conditions, the Average Return Period, or interval between recurrences of this 
event, is approximately 100 years.  

1.2  Average Return Period 
Over a long period of time, the average number of years between occurrences of a particular 
event. In general, the average return period is the reciprocal of the AEP – the relationship is 
illustrated in the following table:

Using AEP to define the likelihood of hazard events is preferable to the average return period 
as return period can lead to a false sense of security created by the belief that the indicated 
number of years will pass before the next event of that magnitude occurs. 

1.3  Designated Flood  
A flood, which may occur in any given year, of such a magnitude as to equal a flood having a 
200-year  recurrence  interval  based  on  a  frequency  analysis  of  unregulated  historic  flood 
records or by regional analysis where there is inadequate streamflow data available. Where 
the flow of a large watercourse is controlled by a major dam, the designated flood shall be set 
on a site-specific basis. 
In  coastal  areas,  the  existing  definition  of  a  Designated  Flood  is  not  appropriate  as  the 
probability of flooding from the sea is the result of the joint occurrence of tide and a storm 
crossing the coastal waters of British Columbia and at some time in the future, sea level rise 
due to climate change.  
In  estuaries,  where  a  river  discharges  into  the  sea,  the  definition  of  the  Designated  Flood 
applies to the river. 
In these documents the definition “Designated Flood” is replaced with the term “Designated 
Storm” as defined below. 

1.4  Designated Flood Level (DFL) 
The observed or calculated elevation for the Designated Flood and is used in the calculation 
of the Flood Construction Level. 
In  coastal  areas,  the  Designated  Flood  Level  (DFL)  includes  the  appropriate  allowance  for 
future sea level rise, tide and the total storm surge expected during the designated storm. 

1.5  Designated Storm (DS) 
A storm, which may occur in any given year, of such a magnitude as to equal a storm having 
the designated annual exceedence probability (AEP).  
The Designated Storm has several phenomena associated with it that will define components 
of  the  Designated  Flood  Level,  including  storm  surge,  wind  set-up,  wave  run-up  and 
overtopping for the storm.  These include: 
  A time series of atmospheric pressure during the passage of the storm over the area in 

question 

  A time series of wind speed and direction during the passage of the storm over the area 

in question 

  A time series of wave conditions, including wave heights, periods and directions during 

the passage of the storm in question. 

1.6  Diking Authority 
(a)  The  commissioners  of  a  district  to  which  Part  2  of  the  Drainage,  Ditch  and  Dike  Act 

applies, 

(b)  A person owning or controlling a dike other than a private dike, 
(b1) If the final agreement of a treaty first nation so provides, the treaty first nation in relation 

to dikes on its treaty lands, 

Appendix A 

2 

 

(c)  A public authority designated by the minister as having any responsibility for maintenance 

of a dike other than a private dike, or 

(d)  A regional district, a municipality or an improvement district. 

1.7  Flood Construction Level (FCL) 
Uses the Designated Flood Level plus an allowance for Freeboard to establish the elevation 
of the underside of a wooden floor system or top of concrete slab for habitable buildings. In 
the  case  of  a  manufactured  home,  the  ground  level  or  top  of  concrete  or  asphalt  pad,  on 
which  it  is  located,  shall  be  equal  to  or  higher  than  the  above  described  elevation.  It  also 
establishes the minimum crest level of a Standard Dike. Where the Designated Flood Level 
cannot be determined or where there are overriding factors, an assessed height above the 
natural boundary of the water-body or above the natural ground elevation may be used (as 
defined in the Land Use Guidelines 2004).  
In coastal areas the FCL does not relate to the crest level of a sea dike, nor does it relate to 
the crest level of flood proofing fill exposed directly to the designated flood level.  The FCL 
does; however, include wave – structure interaction effects, to be determined at the location 
of the site of the building. 

1.8  Flood Construction Reference Plane (FCRP) 
The  vertical  elevation  of  an  estimated  future  Natural  Boundary  from  which  the  FCL  is 
determined. 

1.9  Flood Plain 
A lowland area, whether diked, flood proofed, or not, which, by reasons of land elevation, is 
susceptible to flooding from an adjoining watercourse, ocean, lake or other body of water and 
for  administration  purposes  is  taken  to  be  that  area  submerged  at  the  Designated  Flood 
Level. 
In  coastal  areas  the  concept  of  the  Flood  Plain  has  been  extended  to  a  “Sea  Level  Rise 
Planning Area”; defined below.  Special measures may be warranted in this area. 

1.10  Flood Proofing 
The  alteration  of  land  or structures  either physically  or  in use  to  reduce  flood  damage and 
includes the use of building setbacks from water bodies to maintain a floodway and allow for 
potential erosion. Flood Proofing may be achieved by all or a combination of the following: 
  Building on fill, provided such fill does not interfere with flood flows of the watercourse, 

and is adequately protected against floodwater erosion 

  Building raised by structural means such as foundation walls, columns, etc. 
  A combination of fill and structural means. 
In  coastal  areas  exposed  to  flooding,  construction  of  fill  as  a  flood  proofing  measure  may 
substantially increase the freeboard required to define the FCL, if the fill is directly exposed to 
the Designated Flood Level. In this case, the FCL must be equivalent to the crest level of a 
sea dike with the same characteristics as the seaward face of the fill.. 

1.11  Freeboard  
A  vertical  distance  added  to  the  Designated  Flood  Level.  Used  to  establish  the  Flood 
Construction Level.   

Appendix A 

3 

 

In coastal areas, the vertical distance to be added to a Designated Flood Level is site and 
structure specific. 

1.12  Natural Boundary 
Means the visible high watermark of any lake, river, stream or other body of water where the 
presence  and  action  of  the  water  are  so  common  and  usual  and  so  long  continued  in  all 
ordinary years as to mark upon the soil of the bed of the lake, river, stream or other body of 
water a character distinct from that of the banks thereof, in respect to vegetation, as well as in 
respect to the nature of the soil itself (Land Act, Section 1).  In addition, the natural boundary 
includes the best estimate of the edge of dormant or old side channels and marsh areas.  For 
coastal  areas,  the  natural  boundary  shall  include  the  natural  limit  of  permanent  terrestrial 
vegetation.  
Natural Boundary is an established concept in BC law – and reflects a change in vegetation 
and soil based on effects of the sea. In the Flood Hazard Area Land Use Guidelines 2004, 
building setbacks were established from Natural Boundary, on the unstated assumption that 
the location of Natural Boundary is relatively static (other than erosions and accretions).  
Natural boundary is, in practice, often difficult to determine in the field or from remote survey. 
In  coastal  areas,  the  Natural  Boundary  reflects  a  snapshot  historical  record  of  tide,  storm 
surge and wave runup effects, which may be the mark of a recent storm in an ordinary year or 
it may be the mark of the most severe storm in recent times.  There is no way of knowing for 
certain.  A technical basis for the Natural Boundary in coastal areas is site and time specific.  
In the future the location and elevation of a Natural Boundary will change from time to time 
due to changes associated with sea level rise and it will likely lag sea level rise.  It is also 
unlikely to immediately reflect the action of the water, especially the storm surge and waves, 
during a Designated Storm. 

1.13  Project Life 
The number of years a particular project; including a sea dike, a building or a community, is 
intended  to  serve  before  it  is  replaced,  upgraded  or  dismantled.    Regular  maintenance  to 
ensure the project provides the intended purpose is expected during the project life. 

1.14  Sea Dike 
A dike, floodwall or any other thing that prevents flooding of land by the sea. As defined in the 
Dike Maintenance Act, “dike” means “an embankment, wall, fill, piling, pump, gate, flood box, 
pipe, sluice, culvert, canal, ditch, drain”. 

1.15  Sea Dike Crest Elevation 
Sea  Dike  Crest  Elevation  has  essentially  the  same  meaning  as  “dike  crest  height”  in  the 
existing  document  “Dike  Design  and  Construction  Guide  2003”.  However,  the  existing 
definition  of  dike  height  suggests  that  consideration  of  wave  run-up  and  set-up  is  optional. 
The term Sea Dike Crest Elevation is defined to specifically cover scenarios where wave run-
up, overtopping and wind and wave setup must be included in defining the height of the dike. 

1.16  Sea Dike System 
A  system  of:  dikes,  dunes,  berms  or natural shorelines  that  provide  a  similar  function;  and 
associated  engineering  works  (e.g.,  tidal  gates,  outfalls,  outlet  structures,  seawalls,  quay 
walls, ramps, adjacent building features, etc.) used to protect land from flooding or inundation. 
In the Netherlands where dike systems are highly evolved, a dike system is termed a “dike 
ring” that forms the flooding defence for a region.  There are approximately 95 such rings in 

Appendix A 

4 

 

the Netherlands and each ring is the responsibility of a separate organizational entity, subject 
to national overview. 
In BC, multiple Diking Authorities may share responsibility for the same sea dike system. 

1.17  Sea Level Rise (SLR) 
An allowance for increases in the mean elevation of the ocean associated with future climate 
change, including any regional effects such as crustal subsidence or uplift.  

1.18  Sea Level Rise Planning Area (SLR Planning Area) 
An  area  of  land  that  may  be  subject  to  future  flooding  due  to  Sea  Level  Rise.  This  area 
defines a future coastal flood plain.  The SLR Planning Area extends from the existing Natural 
Boundary  landward  to  the  highest  predicted  point  of  potential  flooding  related  to  SLR  plus 
flooding  expected  from  the  combination  of  high  tide,  total  storm  surge  and  expected  wave 
runup during the Designated Storm. 
Predictions  of  SLR  for  the  SLR  Planning  Area  definition  shall  use  best  predictions  for 
minimum periods of 90-100 years and 200 years forward. From time to time, both the Natural 
Boundary and the predictions for SLR are subject to change, and therefore the extent of a 
SLR Planning Area may be revised at regular intervals in the future. 

1.19  Seastate 
The  term  “seastate”  is  used  to  encapsulate,  in  a  general  way,  all  of  the  parameters  and 
characteristics that may be needed during design to define the waves at a given instant in 
time.    The  sea  state  is  the  general  condition  of  the  free  surface  of  a  body  of  water—with 
respect  to  wind  waves  and  swell—at  a  certain  location  and  moment.  The  sea  state  is 
characterized  by  statistics,  including  wave  height(s),  period(s),  distribution  and  power 
spectrum. The sea state varies with time, as the weather or oceanographic factors change.  
For engineering purposes the seastate is often characterized by the significant wave height, 
Hs. 

1.20  Setback  
Means withdrawal or siting of a building or landfill away from the natural boundary or other 
reference line to maintain a floodway and to allow for potential land erosion.   

1.21  Standard Dikes 
Dikes built to a minimum crest elevation equal to the Flood Construction Level and meeting 
standards  of  design  and  construction  approved  by  the  Ministry  of  Environment  and 
maintained by an ongoing authority such as a local government body. 

1.22  Storm Surge  
A change in water level caused by the action of wind and atmospheric pressure variation on 
the  sea  surface.  The  typical  effect  is  to  raise  the  level  of  the  sea  above  the  predicted 
astronomical tide level, although in some situations, such as when winds blow offshore, the 
actual water level may be lower than that predicted. The magnitude of a storm surge on the 
BC  coast  will  be  dependent  on  the  severity  and  duration  of  the  storm  event  in  the  North 
Pacific, its track relative to the BC coast and the seabed bathymetry at the site. 

1.23  Total Storm Surge 
The combination of the storm surge generated in deep water plus the additional local surge or 
wind setup generated by the effect of the winds during the Designated Storm over shallow 

Appendix A 

5 

 

water at a particular site.  In general the deep water storm surge is nearly the same as that 
recorded at a tidal gauging station.  Additional surge may occur at other sites.  For planning 
purpose, winds during a Designated Storm will start to generate local surge in water depths 
less than 30 m. 

1.24  Wave Run-up 
The vertical distance that waves run-up the seaward slope of a structure or a shoreline.  The 
vertical  distance  is  measured  from  the  mean  water  level,  which  is  the  same  as  the 
Designated Flood Level. 
For  coastal  flooding  hazard  management  the  Wave  Run-up  is  taken  as  50  per  cent  of  the 
calculated  run-up  elevation  on  the  natural  shoreline.    This  ratio  is  based  on  analysis 
completed  for  this  assignment  (2010)  and  may  be  revised  as  more  information  becomes 
available. 
For defining a Sea Dike Crest Elevation the Wave Run-up is taken to be the vertical distance 
exceeded by no more than 2% of the waves during the Designated Storm at the toe of the 
sea dike 

1.25  Wave Set-up  
An increase in mean water surface close to the shoreline caused by wave action; important 
during storm events as it results in a further increase in water level above the tide and surge 
levels, landward of the location where waves start to break. Wave set-up will lead to larger 
waves existing at the seaward toe of a sea dike than might otherwise be expected. 

1.26  Wave Overtopping 
The passage of water over the top of a sea dike as a result of wave runup or related surge 
and setup.  Water overtopping a sea dike may pass over the dike as a flow of water or as 
spray and the specific characteristics are site and structure specific. 

1.27  Wind Set-up 
A rise of the water surface above the water level on the open coast due to the local action of 
wind stress on the water surface.

Introduction 
The incorporation of Sea Level Rise considerations into an update of the existing documents 
for the BC Ministry of Environment is structured into three documents: 
Policy Discussion Paper 2010 
Sea Dike Guidelines 2010 
Guidelines for Management of Coastal Flood Hazard Land Use 2010 
To aid the reader in understanding the updates to the existing documents there is a need to 
understand fundamental concepts and definitions relating to BC Coastal Flood Hazards. This 
Appendix provides a summary of the fundamental concepts and definitions. 

Fundamental Concepts in BC Coastal Flood Hazard 
The  existing document: Flood Hazard Area Land Use Guidelines 2004 was  focussed  on 
river flood risks. The section on flooding by the sea (Section 3.5) did not fully anticipate sea 
level rise and assumed a static sea level. 
Sea Level Rise (SLR) is now understood to be a certainty in the future and very likely to result 
in  an  increase  of  1.0  m  by  2100.  However,  the  rate  and  height  of  SLR  has  considerable 
uncertainty.  The  Policy  Discussion  Paper  2010  summarizes  the  range  of  projections  for 
SLR that apply to BC. 
Figure  B1  illustrates  the  elements  relating  to  the  risks  from  the  sea  in  the  existing  Flood 
Hazard Area Land Use Guidelines 2004. 

Figure B1: Coastal Flood Hazard – Existing (2004) Definitions 

Appendix B 

 

1 

 

 
 
In Figure B1, Mean Sea Level is essentially the same as the terrestrial vertical datum plane of 
Canadian Geodetic Datum = 0 m. The tides, which are nominally centred about mean sea 
level, are established by the definable gravitational interactions between the earth, the sun 
and the moon and are reasonably predicable. Although the difference between mean tide and 
high tide varies from place to place and from time to time, these levels are defined by the 
Canadian Hydrographic Service and available for many locations in coastal British Columbia. 
The Natural Boundary shown on Figure B1 is an established concept in BC law – and reflects 
the change in vegetation and the soil based on effects of the sea. In the Flood Hazard Area 
Land Use Guidelines 2004, building setbacks were established from Natural Boundary, on 
the assumption that the location of Natural Boundary was relatively static (other than erosions 
and accretions).  
The Natural boundary  is, in  practice,  often  difficult  to  determine  in  the  field or  from remote 
survey.  
Flood Construction Level (FCL) is established in the 2004 Guidelines as a general minimum 
of 1.5m above the elevation of the Natural Boundary at the Sea. There are several exceptions 
to these guidelines, including: 
  Coastal Bluffs, where the toe is closer to the Natural Boundary than 15m, or when the toe 

is subject to coastal erosion. 

  Bedrock or designed shore protection might allow a reduced setback. 
  Lands behind Standard Dikes have setbacks and minimum elevations established in the 

Sea Dike Guidelines. 

  Lands  outside  the  Strait  of  Georgia  are  subject  to  tsunami  hazard,  and  that  generally 

prevails over the sea flooding guideline; 

  Lands exposed to other sources of flooding e.g. from river estuaries, may have flooding 

hazards that are higher than the requirements for a hazard from the sea. 

Figure B2 provides a more detailed interpretation of the flooding concepts for the sea in the 
the existing Flood Hazard Area Land Use Guidelines 2004.  In particular: 
  The  location  of  the  Natural  Boundary  is  generally  higher  and  further  inland  than  the 
location of the line marking predicable High Tide. Two natural processes essentially then 
define the location of Natural Boundary: 
o  The water  level  during  an  “ordinary  year”, which results  in  water  and wave actions 
strong enough to mark the shoreline sediments in a distinct manner.  Implicitly this 
suggests  that  it  is  likely  associated  with  a  commonly  occurring  storm  or  “Ordinary 
Storm”. 

 

o  Wave related actions during the ‘Ordinary Storm’. 
the  1.5m  additional  vertical  requirement  that  defines  the  Flood  Construction  Level 
therefore needs to account for two additional considerations:  
o  an additional allowance for storm surge and wave effects for conditions greater than 

the “Ordinary Storm”. 

o  A Freeboard allowance. 

These  considerations  are  shown  in  Figure  B2.    If  a  freeboard  allowance  of  0.6  m  is 
considered,  based  on  the  freeboard  allowance  in  the  existing  companion  document  Dike 

Appendix B 

2 

 

Design  and  Construction  Guide  20031,  then  an  amount  of  0.9  m  remains  to  account  for 
storm surge and wave effects for conditions greater than the “Ordinary Storm”.  An allowance 
of 0.9 m is a reasonable allowance in many situations to allow for a rise in the total water level 
during a severe storm. 

 

 

Figure B2: Coastal Flood Hazard - Interpretation of Existing 2004 Definitions 

 

Figure B3 extends this interpretation of the Existing Definitions to include a specific allowance 
for Sea Level Rise (SLR) and the expected effects during a ‘Designated Storm’ – i.e.: a storm 
that  meets  a  stated  risk  criteria.    These  combined  influences  define  the  total  water  level 
expected at any time in the future for any designated annual exceedence probability (AEP). 
(See Definitions in Appendix A).

Figure B3: Coastal Flood Hazard – Adaptation for Climate Change 

 
Sea Level Rise will gradually raise both the mean sea level (MSL) and the tidal levels along 
the BC Coast. Both MSL and tidal levels will rise in approximately equal amounts in response 
to SLR. For example, if the MSL rises 1.0m, all tide levels, including High Tide, also will rise 
by  1.0m.    Over  time  this  will  mean  that  MSL  is  no  longer  approximately  the  same  as  the 
terrestrial  vertical  datum  plane (CGD), unless  the  terrestrial  datum  plane  is  adjusted  at  the 
same rate. 
As sea level rises, the storms that occur will leave a mark on the slowly changing shoreline.  
In particular the ‘Designated Storm’ will define; in conjunction with the local coastal exposure, 
the nearshore bathymetry, shoreline orientation and topography, a Total Storm Surge and an 
additional wave related runup (Wave Effects). The combination of antecedent storms and the 
Designated  Storm  will  move  the  existing  Natural  Boundary  landward  to  a  new  Natural 
Boundary location at the top of the wave affected zone. At any given time in the future, the 
actual mark of this tide, storm and wave action will reflect the latest storm events, which may 
or may not be “ordinary” and the response of the particular stretch of shoreline. 
It is recommended that a combination of the ‘Designated Flood Level’ and an estimate of the 
expected shoreline response be used to establish the future Estimated Natural Boundary for 
planning  purposes,  as  this  is  a  more  predictable  and  practical  tool  than  relying  on  future 
vegetation  or  soil  response  interpretations,  in  particular  when  SLR  changes  may  be  faster 
than  the  new  shoreline  sediment  or  vegetation  responds.    It  is  also  not  clear  that  at  any 
particular time the mark on the shoreline will reflect an “ordinary” year. The elevation of this 
Estimated Natural Boundary location is defined as the Flood Construction Reference Plane 
(FCRP). 
To  calculate  the  FCL  a  Freeboard  allowance  is  added  above  the  Flood  Construction 
Reference  Plane  (FCRP)  to  allow  for  uncertainty.  This  Freeboard  allowance  may  include

uncertainties in the future changes to storm surge, wave run-up, and the effects of sea level 
rise on delta flooding and coastal sediment supply. 
The Freeboard allowance should be the greater of: 
  0.6m, or; 
  For flood proofing fill – crest elevation of equivalent sea dike (see Sea Dike Guidelines 

2010) 

  For exposed vertical building foundations – the wave-structure interaction; 
  For tsunami areas – the runup elevation of the appropriate tsunami hazard. 
In  summary  the  general  concept  for  calculating  Future  Flood  Construction  Level  with  SLR 
Allowance is: 
  Future SLR Allowance + 
  Maximum High Tide (HHWLT) + 
  Storm Surge During Designated Storm + 
  Wave Effects During Designated Storm + 
  Freeboard Allowance 
The FCL calculation will vary for a given target year, and will vary for local areas in calculation 
of both High Tide as well as storm surge and wave effects.

Sample Planning Wording 
The Official Community Plan Policies Template (Form 1, Appendix B of the existing guideline 
document Land Use Guidelines 20041) should have the following statement appended: 
“In  coastal  and  estuarine  lowland  areas  of  BC,  Sea  Level  Rise  may  increase  the  risks  of 
flooding to existing and proposed developments. The OCP text and maps describe Sea Level 
Rise Planning Areas and associated Flood Construction Levels based on best current Sea 
Level  Rise  projections.  The  OCP  and  maps  describe  the  locations  and  Flood  Construction 
Levels  for  buildings  based  on  the  planned  building  lifespan.  Where  buildings  are  to  be 
constructed  within  the  SLR  planning  area,  they  shall  be  subject  to  a  restrictive  covenant 
stipulation of the hazard, building requirements, and liability disclaimer” 
The  text  of  the  OCP  should  also  state  that  the  policies  related  to  Sea  Level  Rise  will  be 
subject to refinement as more data and information becomes available on SLR elevations and 
risks for the plan area.
