A home isolated by flooding on the St. John River

property  is  available  during  a  flood.  It  is  therefore 
important  to  consider  how  a  flood  will  affect 
(e.g. 
movement  by  people  and  vehicles 
for 
evacuation,  or  access  by  police, 
fire  and 
ambulance services). This requires consideration of 
the  anticipated  flood  depth,  the  speed  that  the 
water  will  be  moving  and  the  distance  to  the 
nearest  “dry  land”.  A  good  rule  of  thumb  is  to 
assume that for ponded (non-flowing) water, the 
maximum depth of flooding for safe access by most 
cars  is  about  0.3  metres  (1  foot);  the  maximum 
depth for pedestrian access is about 1.4 metres (5 
feet) for adults and 1 metre (3 feet) for children)a . 
These  safe  depths  decrease  as  water  velocity 
increases.  Even  shallow  water  can  sweep  a 
pedestrian  or  a  vehicle  away  when  flowing  at 
high  velocity.  Also  remember  that  it  may  be 
difficult  to  judge  the  depth  and  speed  of  flood 
waters. Water may appear to be relatively calm even when moving at a high velocity and it may be 
impossible to see the bottom to determine flood depth. Prolonged exposure to cold water could 
lead to hypothermia. 
 
In  addition  to  property  access,  building  accessibility  is  also  an  important  consideration.  Some  of  the 
floodproofing measures described in this booklet restrict the use of doors and windows and may require 
the use of alternate entrances and exits. 
 
Municipal by-laws and permits - As is the case with any construction including modifications to existing 
buildings,  floodproofing  must  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  all  applicable  building  code,  fire  code, 
local by-law and building permit requirements. For example, the local planning authority (i.e., municipality, 
regional municipality, rural community, Regional Service Commission or the province as the case may be) 
may prohibit construction within a flood hazard area or impose specific conditions. For more information 
contact your local planning authority. 
 
Provincial policies and permits - A Watercourse and Wetland Alteration Permit  is required prior to fill 
placement or other activities such as construction, demolition, clearing land, landscaping, etc., within 30 
metres of a wetland or watercourse. Additional information is available at:

The  importance  of  doing  it  right  -  While  some  floodproofing  techniques  can  be  put  in  place  by  a 
knowledgeable  property  owner,  many  require  the  assistance  of  qualified  people  to  design  and  install 
them.  Members of the following associations can provide advice and assistance on floodproofing your

Permanent Floodproofing Measures 
 
Permanent floodproofing measures are incorporated into the design of a building or building lot. They are 
permanently in place and require no additional action by property owners or occupants at the time of a 
flood. Examples are contained in the following sections.  
 
Sewage Connections and Lot Drainage 
 
The  following  measures  will  benefit  any  dwelling,  regardless  of  location  with  respect  to  flooding.  They 
focus on addressing issues associated with roof drainage, plumbing, municipal utilities, and lot grading. 
They include: 
 

Improved lot grading and channels to direct water away from buildings 
Foundation drains to direct groundwater away from the foundation 
Eaves trough downspouts that are not connected to foundation drains and are extended 
away from the building wall 
A basement sump pump (with appropriate capacity and stand-by electrical power ) connected 
to a storm sewer or a free-flowing surface outlet. Avoid connecting the sump pump to the 
sanitary sewer 
Basement window wells (where warranted by site grading), to ensure that window sills are 
above the adjacent ground surface  
Valves  that  prevent  backflow  (from  a  municipal  sewer  or  septic  system)  from  entering  the 
building. Sewer backups can cause major damage and inconvenience and occur when sewer 
outlets become flooded and water is forced back through the sewer line into a building. It is 
important to remember that buildings can be affected even if situated in areas where there is 
no flooding.

The above measures are described in detail in guidance prepared by the City of Moncton, called The 
Homeowner’s Guide to Flood Protection available at:  
http://www.moncton.ca/Assets/Government+English/Publications+English/Flood+protection+manual.pdf 
 
Additional information is also provided in Floodproofing for Utilities on page 16. 
 
Dry Floodproofing 
 
Dry  floodproofing  means  closing  off  or  relocating  all  openings  in  a  building  wall  or  foundation  that 
otherwise might allow flood water to enter a building. For example, windows, doors and other openings 
located below the anticipated flood depth can be permanently closed in and sealed. Any water-resistant 
material of sufficient strength can be used (e.g. bricks, concrete blocks, glass bricks, etc.). Once closed 
in, the openings can no longer be used, so this measure should only be used if the windows and doors 
are not needed by the building occupants and are not required in order to meet the requirements of the 
National Building Code and National Fire Code.  
 
Waterproof  coatings  or  sealants  can  be  applied  to  basement  floors  and  foundation  walls  to  reduce  or 
eliminate seepage.  Cracks or gaps can be filled in with sealants and a continuous waterproof membrane 
can  be  used  to  line  the  outside  of  the  foundation.  Membranes  may  be  susceptible  to  damage  when 
backfill is placed, so proper installation is important.  Special attention is also required for any openings

used  for  utilities  such  as  electricity,  telephone,  propane,  natural  gas,  sewer  and  water,  to  prevent 
infiltration and leakage into the building.  
 
The above measures can be used in combination with temporary flood shields and watertight doors as 
described under Contingency (Temporary) Floodproofing Measures on page 13. 
 
It’s important to know that although it may be technically feasible to seal the openings in external walls 
and  foundations  to  create  a  watertight  barrier,  it’s  not  always  a  good  idea  because  other  parts  of  the 
building wall or foundation may still fail during a flood. The structural integrity of even well-built, modern 
homes may be threatened if saturated ground extends above the basement floor elevation or if the flood 
level is higher than the top of the foundation. Therefore, in order to reduce the potential for severe 
structural  damage,  expert  advice  should  be  obtained  before  installing  closures,  sealants  and 
other flood barriers that are integrated into the building walls and foundation. A qualified expert 
can  determine  if  the  walls,  foundation  and  basement  floor  are  strong  enough  to  withstand  the 
weight of water pressing on the building from the outside (called hydrostatic pressure).  
 
No matter what type of foundation is used, the building should be anchored to prevent flotation or lateral 
movement in the event of a flood. 
 
Wet Floodproofing 
 
In  any  location  where  floodwater  is  expected  to reach  the outside  of  a  building  or  foundation  wall,  the 
resultant water pressure can be so severe that foundations can collapse and buildings can be heaved out 
of the ground, or off their foundations. Where pervious (sandy) soils allow water to move easily through 
the ground, this damage could happen even if no water is visible at the surface. In these circumstances, 
wet floodproofing (purposely allowing the water to enter the building so that the pressures on the interior 
and exterior of the building are balanced) may help prevent serious structural damage.  While the building 
interior (in particular the basement) will receive some flooding, measures can still be taken to reduce the 
potential for damage due to wetting of the building structure or contents. 
 
Wet  floodproofing  requires  that  openings  be  provided  to  all 
enclosed  spaces  below  the  anticipated  flood  elevation.  The 
idea  is  to  reduce  water  pressure  by  letting  it  enter  the 
enclosed  spaces  at  the  same  rate  that  the  floodwaters  rise 
outside.  The  building  should  also  be  anchored  to  prevent 
lateral movement.  
 
When  using  wet  floodproofing  it  is  also  important  to  ensure 
that  any  structural  materials  (beams,  subfloors,  insulation, 
framing  etc.) and  finishing  materials  (wall  coverings,  flooring, 
etc.)  that  may  be  exposed  to  flood  waters  are  resistant  to 
damage  from  wetting  and drying (e.g. swelling  and cracking) 
and  can  be  cleaned  once  the  flooding  has  subsided.  Even 
materials  that  will  not  come  into  direct  contact  with  flood 
waters  should  be  capable  of  resisting  moisture  and  humidity.  In  general,  materials  such  as  untreated 
wood, particle board, carpeting, corkboard, plaster, regular plywood, gypsum drywall, laminate flooring, 
linoleum, vinyl wall coverings, non-ceramic floor tiles, etc., should be avoided. Batt and blanket types of 
insulation such as mineral wool or fibreglass should also be avoided because they will retain water and 

Case Study: The “Spray and Wash” 
Basement 
 
Last  June,  a  homeowner’s  basement 
took  in  five  feet  of  water.    The  fully 
finished basement had to be gutted. If 
it  happens  again,  cleanup  should  be 
much  easier.  The  rebuilt  basement 
now  includes  metal  stairs,  polished 
concrete floors, and walls clad in foam 
insulation  covered  with  mortar  and 
steel  mesh  and  coated  in  concrete 
and sealant.

trap  any  floating  contaminants.    Alternative  materials  include  marine  grade  plywood,  cement  board, 
concrete, glazed clay tile, plastic lumber (with no wood filling), non-absorbent natural or artificial stone or 
stone veneer with waterproof grouting, steel wall panels, ceramic or concrete tile (with mortar rather than 
an adhesive), metal doors, closed cell or plastic foam insulation, etc.  
 
When wet floodproofing is employed, the dwelling owner or occupant should also prepare a plan listing 
vulnerable furnishings and possessions along with a predetermined strategy for removing them quickly to 
a location above the flood elevation.  In addition provision should be made for dewatering (pumping out 
and  dehumidifying)  the  basement  once  the  flood  is  over.  Other  measures  associated  with  wet 
floodproofing, including special considerations for electrical services are described under Floodproofing 
for Utilities on page 16.  
 
If a building may be subject to damage from waves, floating ice, or debris during a flood then wet 
floodproofing  is  not  a  good  option.    Another  caution  regarding  wet  floodproofing  is  that  during  cold 
weather, water that enters a building can freeze and expand, causing additional damage. Therefore, wet 
floodproofing may not be the best option if other alternatives are available.    
 
Below Grade Living Space  
 
Basements  are  the  lowest  part  of  a  building  and  are  therefore  most  susceptible  to  flooding.    In  early 
homes, basements were usually not considered as living space and were more often used as storage 
areas.  In modern homes, basements are often finished with wall coverings and flooring and are used as 
recreation rooms, bedrooms or as fully-equipped apartments. 
 
Finished basements and their contents are highly vulnerable to flood damage. To avoid risks to life and 
property,  wet  floodproofing  should  not  be  used  to  accommodate  below  grade  living  space  in 
buildings  that  may  be  affected  by  sudden  or  rapid  flooding.    While  dry  floodproofing  (employing 
measures to seal off a basement to keep flood water out) might seem to be the best solution, this may not 
be  a  feasible  option.  As  previously  noted,  even  if  the  water  is  not  flowing  quickly,  the  weight  of  water 
pressing in on a watertight building wall or foundation could result in significant structural damage.       
 
Raising the Building 
 
Raising a building above the flood level may reduce potential damage to a building and its contents in the 
event  of  a  flood.    For  locations  where  flood  hazard  maps  or  sea  level  predictions  are  available,  the 
appropriate elevation can be obtained by referring to the past or predicted flood elevations. (See Finding 
Flood Information in New Brunswick on page 22). Even if the flood water is higher than expected and 
enters the building, the flood damage will be reduced, since the depth of the water and the length of time 
the building's contents are exposed will be less. Including some extra height above the anticipated flood 
level offers an additional margin of safety. 
 
Elevation on Fill 
 
This option means constructing a mound and relocating the building on top of it. Care should be taken in 
the  selection  of  the  fill  material  Silts  and  very  uniform  sands  are  undesirable  as  they  are  difficult  to 
compact. Instead the fill material should include well-graded sands and gravels since they are the most 
suitable for supporting the weight of buildings. Ensuring proper fill compaction is also important. This is 
usually addressed by placing the fill in a series of layers or “lifts” and compacting each layer before the

the 

considerations 

 
Placing  fill  overtop  of  organic  soils  can  lead  to 
instability.  The  existing  topsoil and subsoil  may 
have  to  be  removed  first  and  replaced  with 
another  material 
(sand,  gravel,  synthetic 
materials  etc.)  to  provide  the  needed  bearing 
capacity.  The  sides  of 
fill  should  be 
protected against erosion, and sloped in such a 
way as to prevent slumping. The fill should not 
extend  onto  adjacent  properties,  so  it  is  also 
important  to  know  the  location  of  property 
boundaries.    Retaining  a  professional  engineer 
and a land surveyor will help ensure that each of 
the  above 
is  adequately 
addressed. 
 
Elevating an existing building on fill may not 
be  feasible  in  locations  where  flood  waters 
flow deep  and  fast  because: a) the  required 
volume and depth of fill will be large; b) the 
fill  may  be  subject  to  erosion  by  flowing 
water;  c)  safe  access  may  not  be  available 
during a flood and d) the fill may block flood 
flow,  leading  to  higher  flood  elevations  on 
adjacent  properties.  Effective  use  of  this 
option 
to 
buildings  located  near  the  edges  of  flood 
hazard  areas.  In  addition,  a  Watercourse  and 
Wetland Alteration Permit is required prior to fill 
such  as 
placement  or  other  activities 
construction, 
land, 
landscaping, etc., within 30 metres (100 feet) of 
a  wetland  or  watercourse.  Those  considering 
fill  placement  in  coastal  areas  should  also 
consult  New  Brunswick’s  Coastal  Areas 
Protection Policy. 
 
The  foundation  of  a  building  raised  on  fill  may 
still be subject to flood damage if the basement 
flood 
floor 
the  anticipated 
elevation.  Flood  water  can  damage 
the 
foundation by exerting pressure on it if the water 
is  able  to  percolate  through  the  fill.  Special 
foundation design and use of anchors to prevent 
buoyancy  may  be  required.    Construction  on  a 
concrete  slab  placed  on  top  of  the  fill  (i.e.  a 
foundation with no basement) may an option.

 Elevation on a Raised Foundation, Piers or Columns 
 
This option means designing and reconstructing a building foundation that is high enough to ensure that 
the living area of a building is raised above the anticipated flood level. This requires that the building be 
separated from its existing foundation, raised on hydraulic jacks, and held by temporary supports while a 
new or vertically extended foundation is constructed below. This retrofit is typically most feasible for wood 
frame homes originally built on basement, crawlspace, or open foundations. Masonry homes can be more 
difficult to lift, primarily because of their design, construction, and weight, but raising these homes may 
still be possible.  
 
The new foundation can consist either of continuous 
concrete  walls  designed 
to  address  hydrostatic 
pressure,  or  an  open  foundation  comprised  of  a 
series  of  piers,  posts,  columns,  or  piles.  Regardless 
of the foundation type, the foundation design should 
consider issues such as debris loading during a flood 
event,  the  position  and  orientation  of  the  supports, 
soil  conditions,  and  anchoring,  bracing  and 
connection details. Expert advice should be retained 
to  design 
its 
construction.  
 
Elevating a building on piers and columns instead of 
a foundation wall may be useful for coastal locations 
and inland locations exposed to high velocity flow or 
ice  jams,  because  flowing  water,  waves,  ice  and 
debris may be able to pass under the building without 
causing impact-related damage. The supporting piers 
and columns and their footings should be designed to 
support the building weight and withstand the force of 
moving water as well as the impact of ice and debris. 
Mechanically  driven  piles  may  be  the  best  solution 
where  erosion  is  expected  to  be  severe,  such  as 
exposed coastal locations. The open area under the 
building  can  be  used  for  other  purposes  such  as 
storage space for low value items. 
 
When  planning  an  elevated  foundation,  it’s  important  to  determine  how  high  the  foundation should be. 
(See  Finding  Flood  Information  in  New  Brunswick  on  page  22).  When  selecting  the  appropriate 
elevation  it  may  be  wise  to  add  some  extra  elevation  to  account  for  uncertainties  in  the  water  level 
estimate. 
 
Remember that use of this option is subject to the approval of the planning authority (municipality, 
regional  municipality,  rural  community,  Regional  Service  Commission  of  the province  as  the  case  may 
be). This option does not provide for safe access to a property during a flood. A Watercourse and 
Wetland  Alteration  Permit  is  required  prior  to  fill  placement  or  other  activities  such  as 
construction,  demolition,  clearing  land,  landscaping,  etc.,  within  30  metres  of  a  wetland  or 
watercourse.    Those  considering  elevating  a  building  on  a  raised  foundation  in  coastal  areas 
should also consult New Brunswick’s Coastal Areas Protection Policy.

Surrounding a building with a flood barrier will be of limited benefit if sewer, water or other drainage pipes 
continue to allow floodwater a path of entry. If such pipes extend beyond the limits of the barrier, they will 
have to be equipped with backflow preventers or manually operated shut-off valves. See also Sewage 
Connections and Lot Drainage (Page 5) and Floodproofing Utilities (Page 16). Remember that once 
a valve on a sewer pipe is closed, sewage from the building will be blocked and may overflow if sinks, 
toilets etc. are used.  
 
Consideration should also be given to drainage of the area within the berm. This means that snow melt 
and precipitation must be allowed to drain away from the building and through the barrier via pipes or 
channels that can be closed off during flooding. Finally, driveways or other gaps in the barrier must be 
blocked  when  a  flood  occurs.  Sandbags  or  other  equivalent  materials  can  be  kept  on  hand  for  this 
purpose (see Temporary Dikes on page 14).  
 
As  is  the  case  with  construction  on  fill,  the  use  of  floodwalls  or  berms  is  not  recommended  in 
locations where flood waters flow fast and deep since the wall or berm will have to be high and 
may be subject to scour and erosion. In addition the wall or berm may block or deflect flood flow, 
leading to higher flood elevations on adjacent, unprotected properties. Sudden failure of a flood 
wall or berm may have greater safety or damage consequences than if the wall or berm had not 
been constructed. Those intending to construct a flood wall or berm should confirm that these 
features are permitted by the planning authority (municipality, regional municipality, rural community, 
Regional  Service  Commission  or  the  province  as  the  case  may  be).  A  Watercourse  and  Wetland 
Alteration  Permit  is  required  prior  to  fill  placement  or  other  activities  such  as  construction, 
demolition,  clearing  land,  landscaping,  etc.,  within  30  metres  of  a  wetland  or  watercourse.  Fill 
placement  within  a  wetland  will  generally  not  be  permitted.  Those  considering  construction  in 
coastal areas should also consult New Brunswick’s Coastal Areas Protection Policy. 
 
Relocation 
 
Relocation  means  moving  an  existing  building  that  is  vulnerable  to  flooding  to  a  site  that  is  above  the 
flood  elevation.  If  flood  risk  is  severe  and  alternative  locations  are  available,  this  may  be  the  most 
effective  floodproofing  option.  This  option  involves  retaining  a  specialist  contractor  to  lift  an  existing 
building from its foundation and transport it to a new foundation at the new site.   
 
When deciding whether or not relocation is a feasible option, factors to consider include the:  

 

 
 

 

type of building (the easiest structures to relocate are single story wood frame buildings with a 
regular, rectangular shape); 
condition of the structure (is it structurally sound so that it can be moved?);  
route between the existing site and the new one (are there low power lines, narrow roads, weight 
restrictions, tight corners, etc. that will have to be addressed?);  
characteristics of the new site (elevation above flooding, safe access during flooding, ability to 
provide services such as well and septic system, etc.);  

  permits that may be required including building permits and permits for over-size/overmass loads 

from the Department of Transportation and Infrastructure; and 
relative costs of relocation versus demolition and reconstruction.

Temporary Floodproofing Measures 
 
Temporary  floodproofing  measures  are  put  into  place 
immediately  before  a  flood  and  are  intended  to  keep 
water  out  of  a  building 
flood’s  duration. 
Contingency  measures  are  sometimes  referred  to  as 
“active 
they  require  human 
intervention  in  advance  of  a  flood.  They  are  therefore 
only useful if sufficient warning time is available to allow 
floodproofing measures to be deployed and the building 
owner  or  another  knowledgeable  person  is  available  to 
put the measures in place. Where possible, floodproofing 
measures that are permanently in place are preferred.  
 
Flood Shields 
 
Flood shields are removable watertight barriers designed 
to  prevent  the  passage  of  water  through  windows  and 
doors. They consist of panels constructed of a durable, 
impervious  material  (usually  metal)  that  can  be  readily 
installed  and  sealed  using  rubber  gaskets  or  special 
sealants around the edges. 
 
To ensure quick and easy installation during a period of 
immanent flood risk, flood shields should be stored close 
to the openings to be sealed, color-coded or numbered 
as  to  location  and  installation  priority  and  held  in  place 
by  simple,  quick  connecting  fasteners  and  latching 
devices.  
 
To  ensure  that  flood  shields  will  be  effective  when 
installed, periodic inspection and testing is advised. 
 
Watertight Doors and Temporary Bulkheads 
 
Watertight  doors  are  permanently  installed,  but  are 
designed  to  be  closed  and  sealed  only  during  floods. 
They  are  heavy  and  expensive  and  are  generally more 
suited 
than 
houses.  In  locations  where  anticipated  flood  elevations 
will not greatly exceed ground level, bolt-on, partial flood 
panels or barriers can be installed to protect the bottom 
portion of a doorway.    
 
It is important to realize that in order to be effective, 
flood  shields  and  watertight  doors  must  be  well-
maintained  and  incorporate  smooth,  close-fitting 
surfaces,  waterproof  gaskets  and  locking  bolts.    In 

to  commercial  and 

industrial  buildings 

 

12 

general,  permanent  closures  or  sealants,  or 
relocating  doors  and  windows  above  the  flood 
level are more effective measures. 
 
To  prevent  flood  waters  from  entering  through  doors 
and  windows  a  temporary  wall  or  “bulkhead”  can  be 
constructed.  For  example 
“tongue  and  groove” 
wooden planks can be stacked on top of each other. 
The temporary wall can be covered by a plastic sheet 
and supported by a grooved concrete or steel channel 
attached to the sides of the door or window. A double 
layer  of  sandbags  placed  at  the  base  may  help  to 
reduce seepage and provide additional stability. 
 
As  is  the  case  for  closures  and  sealants,  expert 
advice  should  be  obtained  to  determine  if  flood 
shields,  watertight  doors  and  bulkheads  are 
feasible  options,  based  on  the  anticipated  depth  of 
flooding. 
 
Temporary Dikes 
 
Stacking  sandbags  to  form  a  barrier  against  rising 
floodwaters  is  a  common  emergency  floodproofing 
technique.  They  can  be  put  in  place  to  surround  a 
vulnerable  building  or  can  be  installed  as  needed  to 
protect  low  openings  such  as  basement  windows, 
patio doors, etc. The bags must be strong enough to 
hold  the  sand  in  place  and  withstand  prolonged 
contact  with  water.  Burlap  and  plastic  bags  can  be 
purchased that are specially made to be filled with sand. 
 
Flood  water  will  exert  pressure  against  the  dike  so  if 
possible, a trench should be dug to anchor the dike to 
the ground and prevent it from moving. 
 
Leaving  some  vacant  space  within  the  bags  will  allow 
the bags to overlap and mold together under their own 
weight, locking them in place. In addition, the orientation 
of the bags should alternate, so that each layer of bags 
is placed at right angles to the layers above and below. 
This adds stability to the structure. For added protection, 
a durable plastic sheet can be placed on the outer side 
of the dike to prevent the seepage of water through the 
barrier. 
 
A  number  of  alternatives  to  sandbags  have  been 
devised, 
including  re-usable,  anchored,  rubber  or 

 

13 

rubberized tubes filled with water, interlocking panels designed to hold back flood water and various other 
modular barriers constructed of high density materials, anchored in place and filled with sand or water to 
increase  their  weight.  These  may  be  worthwhile  options  to  consider  and  may  be  easier  to  install  than 
sandbags. If selected, they should be installed in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations.

Floodproofing for Utilities 
 
If the utilities serving a building are damaged, even a structurally 
sound residence may be rendered uninhabitable after a flood due 
to  unsafe  or  unsanitary  conditions.  This  risk  can  be  reduced  by 
incorporating floodproofing features into the services contained in 
existing buildings. This is particularly important when furnaces and 
other vulnerable facilities are located in a basement and when wet 
floodproofing  is  being  employed.    When  floodproofing  building 
utilities, primary consideration should be given to preventing flood 
waters from contacting the components that are most susceptible 
to water damage.    
 
Some  potential  measures  are  included  in  Table  1  (below),  and 
described  in  more  detail  in  references  contained  in  Additional 
Information on Floodproofing at the end of this booklet.

  All measures and modifications must adhere to the all 

applicable provisions of the National Building Code and

Household Hazardous Materials 
 
Some  household  materials  are  potentially  hazardous  to  the  environment  and  human  health.  These 
products should therefore be securely stored to prevent their release during a flood. To reduce the risk of 
contamination: 
 

  Clearly identify and label contents of, drums, or other containers, especially when materials are 

placed in other than their original containers; 

  Place your name and address on larger fuel and propane tanks to facilitate identification of their 

contents and their return if they become displaced; 

  Store drums and containers in areas that are least susceptible to flood waters. When possible, 

keep them in fenced enclosures, cabinets, or storerooms; 

  Minimize the amounts and types of materials kept on site. Purchase only what you need; 
 

If time permits dispose of household hazardous waste materials prior to a flood, at a household 
hazardous  waste  collection  centre.  For  more  information  on  how  to  dispose  of  household 
hazardous waste materials, contact your local Solid Waste Commission.

6. Consult with your local planning authority and provincial officials. Remember that the proposed 
work must comply with all applicable building code, fire code, by-law and building permit requirements. 
Some  planning  authorities  may  prohibit  construction  within  a  flood  hazard  area.  In  addition,  any 
applicable  provincial  permits  must  be  obtained.  For  example  a  Watercourse  and  Wetland  Alteration 
Permit is required prior to fill placement or other activities such as construction, demolition, clearing land, 
landscaping,  etc.,  within  30  metres  (100  feet)  of  a  wetland  or  watercourse.    Those  considering 
construction in coastal areas should also consult New Brunswick’s Coastal Areas Protection Policy. 
 
7. Select an appropriate method of floodproofing. Always seek expert advice about the best way to 
floodproof your home because improper floodproofing selection and design can put people and property 
at risk. 
 
8.  Plan  your  floodproofing  project  and  hire  experts  to  do  the work.  Use  a  licensed,  bonded,  and 
insured contractor. Before hiring a contractor, be sure to check references. 
 
9. Know the extent of the remaining flood risk, because it can’t be eliminated entirely.

Finding Flood Information in New Brunswick 
 
Flood Hazard Maps and Flood Level Predictions 
 
In New Brunswick, flood hazard maps have been prepared for a number of areas that are known to be at 
risk of flooding. The maps describe the extent and anticipated frequency of flooding, and can be used to 
obtain flood depths at specific locations. New Brunswick’s flood hazard maps can be viewed and 
downloaded at:   
 
http://www2.gnb.ca/content/gnb/en/departments/elg/environment/content/flood.html 
 
In  addition,  predicted  sea  levels  have  been  calculated  for  all  of  coastal  New  Brunswick,  taking  into 
account the effects of high tides, storm surges and future sea level rise. This information is available in 
Updated Sea-Level Rise and Flooding Estimates for New Brunswick Coastal Sections (2014). 
https://atlanticadaptation.ca/en/islandora/object/acasa%3A731 
 
Some coastal communities have prepared coastal flood hazard maps. Check with your local planning 
authority.  
 
Other Sources of Information 
 
Not  all  of  New  Brunswick’s  flood-prone  locations  have  been  identified  on  flood  hazard  maps  and 
properties throughout the province may occasionally be impacted by localized flooding due to high water 
levels in rivers, streams and ditches, high groundwater levels, local drainage issues, and low elevation. 
Other  potential  sources  of  flood  information  include  local  planning  authorities,  media  reports,  historical 
records contained in public libraries and your own personal experience. Long-term residents can also be 
excellent sources of information on the history of flooding in your area. Predictions based on site-specific 
calculations performed by an engineering consultant can also be used as a guide.

Real time water level elevations are available from Environment Canada for selected rivers throughout 
New Brunswick at:    
http://wateroffice.ec.gc.ca/ 
 
Public Alerts are issued by Environment Canada for abnormally high water levels and high waves (storm 
surge or storm tide) caused by storms, which have the potential to cause coastal flooding:
