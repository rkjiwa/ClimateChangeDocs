RECOMMENDED CITATION:

Andrey, J., and Palko, K. (2017). Introduction. In K. Palko and  
D.S. Lemmen (Eds.), Climate risks and adaptation practices for 
the Canadian transportation sector 2016 (pp. 2-10).  Ottawa,

The Earth’s climate is changing, and Canada is warming at a faster rate than most regions in the 

world. From 1950 to 2010, the average annual temperature in Canada has increased by close to 
1.5°C, which is approximately double the global average (Bush et al., 2014). This warming trend has 
been associated with changes to other important climatic variables, including precipitation, sea level, 
inland water levels, sea ice, permafrost, and extreme weather events (Table 1). 

In the coming decades, anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases will result in further changes to 
global and regional climates. These changes have implications for the transportation sector, and the 
Canadian economy and society more broadly.  

The Government of Canada has produced a series of climate change assessments at the national 
level, which identify observed and expected impacts to Canada’s economy, society, and 
environment; and practices to adapt to these impacts. These include: 

•  Canada’s Marine Coasts in a Changing 

Climate (2016);

•  Canada in a Changing Climate: Sector  
Perspectives on Impacts and Adaptation 
(2014); 

•  From Impacts to Adaptation: Canada in  

a Changing Climate (2007);

•  Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation: 

A Canadian Perspective (2004); and,

•  Canada Country Study: Climate Impacts 

and Adaptation (1997-98).

While these reports indicate that some aspects of transportation are highly vulnerable to changing 
climatic conditions, adapting infrastructure and operations to a changing climate and emerging 
environmental conditions remains a relatively new area of focus for the transportation sector.

PURPOSE AND FORMAT OF REPORT

This report is a snap-shot in time, presenting the state of knowledge about climate risks to the 
Canadian transportation sector, and identifying existing or potential adaptation practices that may 
be applied to reduce them. It is intended to serve as an accessible source of information that can 
inform decision-making and policy development, without making recommendations or prescribing 
specific actions which can vary based on different situations.  This report provides transportation 
decision-makers and practitioners with information intended to support enhanced resilience to 
climate risks, while also serving as a knowledge foundation for future research.

The report is organized into six regional and one urban chapter to reflect the different climate 
vulnerabilities, priorities, practices and opportunities across Canada’s national transportation system. 
Each chapter includes a profile of the region’s population, economy, climate and transportation 
networks, in addition to examining observed climate impacts, future risks, opportunities, and 
adaptation approaches for road, rail, air, and marine transportation. 

Climate risks considered within the framework of this report include both changing climate conditions 
(“slow onset” changes, such as permafrost thaw and sea level changes) and extreme weather

weather event to climate change, there is 
growing confidence that some types of extreme 
events will increase in frequency and/or intensity 
as the climate continues to warm, and these 
events represent significant risks to transportation 
infrastructure and operations.

The development of this report represents 
a significant and collaborative effort in 
bringing together the knowledge, expertise 
and perspectives of the chapter authors and 
reviewers. Based on available literature, each 
chapter includes an assessment of peer-reviewed 
(academic) and grey literature relevant to the 
transportation-climate nexus in the given region. 
Furthermore, to round out the knowledge base 
in cases where existing literature was limited, 
several chapters also integrate perspectives from 
transportation practitioners, and are cited as 
personal communications.

Content that has been deemed out of scope for 
the purposes of this report includes:

• 

• 

Impacts on pipelines and power transmission 
infrastructure;

Indirect impacts on transportation 
associated with climate change impacts 
on other sectors (e.g., agriculture, tourism 
and recreation, fisheries), and other nations. 
Interdependencies among municipal 
sectors are considered in Chapter 9;

•  Disaster and emergency management 

practices; and

The impact of transportation on the climate 
(e.g., greenhouse gas emissions) and 
climate change mitigation activities.

Collectively, these features have shaped the unique content found in the chapters. For example, the 
Urban Chapter emphasizes transportation planning approaches; the British Columbia and Northern 
chapters provide greater detail on engineering practices and extreme precipitation risks; and the 
Prairies Chapter incorporates content on practitioner experiences and adaptations within the trucking 
industry. The Synthesis chapter attempts to bring these regional and urban perspectives together to 
capture the state of knowledge at the national level on climate risks and adaptation practices for 
Canada’s transportation system.

CANADA’S TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM 

Canadians depend on transportation services for day-to-day travel, and for the movement 
of resources and goods vital to the economy. Canada’s communities and markets are widely 
dispersed, spanning a distance of more than 5,000 km from east to west and 4,500 km from north to 
south. Industries such as manufacturing, energy, mining and agriculture, as well as services such as 
healthcare and retail trade, all depend on the reliable functioning of the transportation system.  

All modes of transportation, each with its own unique characteristics, play specific roles in 
local, national, and international movements (Figure 1 and Figure 2). As a whole, the Canadian 
transportation system (including highways, railways, airports, ports, and associated facilities) moved 
over $1.04 trillion of merchandise trade in 2014 (Transport Canada, 2015).

Transportation is jointly governed by Canada’s federal, provincial, and municipal governments. 
Generally, the federal government oversees international and interprovincial transportation (including 
aviation, marine, and rail); provincial governments are responsible for intra-provincial transportation 
(including highways); and municipal governments are responsible for managing urban transportation 
(including transit and local roads). The private sector also plays an important role as owners, operators, 
and managers of infrastructure and assets, including rail infrastructure, vehicles, ships, and aircraft.

Canada has experienced a number of changes to climate variables affecting the transportation 
sector, including temperature, precipitation, permafrost, relative sea level, sea, lake and river 
ice, inland water levels, and extreme weather events; and further changes to these variables are 
projected (Table 1). 

Table 1:  Summary of observed and projected changes to climate and hydrological variables 
relevant to the Canadian transportation system. (Source: Warren and Lemmen, 2014; other sources  
as indicated)

Variable

Temperature

Observed Changes

Canada has become warmer.
 • The average air temperature has 

increased by 1.5°C during the period 
from 1950 to 2010.

 • Hot summer days have become 
more frequent since 1950, while 
the frequency of cold nights has 
decreased, nationally.

Precipitation & Snow 
Cover

Canada has generally become wetter.  
 • Annual average precipitation has 

increased in recent decades.

 • Annual snowfall has declined over most 

of southern Canada and increased in 
the north over the last 6 decades.

Projected Changes
Canada will continue to warm.
 • Warming will be greatest in winter, 

with the largest temperature increases 
projected in northern Canada. 

 • The magnitude of projected warming 

varies substantially with the emission 
scenario.

 • Unusually warm days are projected to 
occur more often throughout the 21st 
century, while unusually cold days and 
nights will become less frequent. 

 • Heat waves are projected to become 

longer, more frequent and more 
intense. By mid-century, a one-in-20-
year extreme hot day is projected to 
become about a one-in-5 year event 
over most of Canada.

Most of Canada will continue to get 
wetter, with regional differences in 
seasonal patterns.
 • Precipitation may decline in summer 
and fall in parts of southern Canada. 

Most of Canada will see less snow cover.
 • Snow cover is projected to decrease in 
southern Canada (especially the west 
coast mountains), while it is projected 
to increase in northern Canada due to 
increased precipitation.

Heavy precipitation events are projected 
to occur more often.
 • Rare extreme precipitation events are 

projected to occur about twice as often 
by mid-century over most of Canada, 
relative to the period from 1950 to 2010.

Permafrost

Permafrost has warmed. 
 • Permafrost temperatures at many sites 

across Canada have increased over 
the past two to three decades.

Permafrost is projected to continue to 
warm at higher rates than those observed 
to date. 
 • It will take many decades to centuries 

for colder permafrost to completely 
thaw.

Relative Sea Level

Sea Ice

Observed Changes

Projected Changes

Sea levels will continue to change.
 • Estimates of future changes in global 

sea level by the year 2100 range from a 
few tens of centimetres to more than a 
metre.

 • Projected changes in Canada range 
from increases of up to 100 cm on the 
Atlantic, Pacific, and Beaufort coasts, 
to decreases of almost 100 cm in the 
central Arctic.

The extent and thickness of sea ice in 
the Canadian Arctic will continue to 
decrease. 
 • Some models project a nearly ice-free 

summer before mid-century in the 
Arctic Ocean. Summer sea ice may 
persist longer in the Canadian Arctic 
Archipelago region.

Sea levels have changed in Canada.
 • Relative sea level has been rising in 

Atlantic Canada and the Beaufort Sea 
(over 3 mm/year), and on the Pacific 
coast to a lesser extent. (Average 
global sea level rose 1.6 mm/year 
between 1880 and 2012).  

 • Where sea level has risen, storm 

surges and coastal erosion have been 
amplified (Atkinson et al., 2016). 

 • Relative sea level has been falling in 

areas where land has been rising due 
to post-glacial rebound. Relative sea 
level has declined about 10 mm/year 
around Hudson Bay. 

Arctic sea ice extent has decreased 
significantly.  
 • Minimum ice extent at the end of 
summer has declined by 13% per 
decade over 1979-2012. Maximum 
winter sea ice extent has declined by 
2.6% per decade.  

 • Ice cover has become increasingly 
dominated by thin first-year ice, with 
significant reduction in the extent of 
thick multi-year ice.

 • Winter sea ice has also declined in the 

Labrador-Newfoundland and Gulf of St. 
Lawrence region.

Lake and River Ice  

Inland water levels

Ice cover duration has been decreasing.
 • Most of Canada has seen trends 

towards earlier ice-free dates (lakes) 
and ice break-up dates (rivers) since 
the mid-20th century, and this trend is 
particularly evident in Western Canada.

Duration of ice cover is projected to 
continue to decrease.
 • Earlier break-up dates and later freeze 

up dates are projected to decrease 
ice cover duration by up to a month by 
mid-century.

Inland water levels have been highly 
variable with episodes of lower than 
normal levels.
 • Great Lakes Water levels were  

below long-term averages from 1997  
to 2012 (Shlozberg et al, 2014) but 
higher than normal in 2013 and 
2014. (Dorling and Hanniman, 2016; 
Great Lakes Environmental Research 
Laboratory, 2015).

Inland water levels are expected to 
continue to fluctuate, with a projected 
trend towards lower water levels.
 • Episodes of low water levels are 

projected to occur more frequently in 
some freshwater bodies (e.g., the Great 
Lakes and Mackenzie River).

 • Some models project decreases in 

water levels of 0.5 to 1 m in the  
Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River  
by 2055 (Shlozberg et al, 2014; Brown  
et al., 2012).

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016SENSITIVITIES OF CANADIAN TRANSPORTATION TO CLIMATE 

All transportation systems are climate-sensitive. These 
sensitivities can translate into infrastructure damage 
and deterioration, disruptions to transport operations, 
and unsafe conditions. Some of the most vulnerable 
components of Canada’s transport system are integral 
to remote and resource-based communities in the 
North. However, a changing climate and extreme 
weather will affect all modes of transportation in every 
Canadian region.  

Transportation’s sensitivities to climate and extreme 
weather are illustrated by the impacts of acute 
weather events in recent years. For example, 
Canada’s costliest disaster – the June 2013 floods 
in Alberta – resulted in an estimated $6 billion in 
damages and recovery costs, and saw 1,000 km 
of roads destroyed and hundreds of bridges and 
culverts washed out. Similarly, the July 2013 flash flood 
in the Greater Toronto Area, which is considered to 
be the most expensive natural disaster in Ontario, 
caused major transit delays, road closures, and flight 
cancellations (Environment Canada, 2014). 

EXTREME WEATHER TRENDS

Trends in extreme precipitation events 
have been difficult to identify from 
climate data, due to spatial variability in 
precipitation patterns. However, insurance 
data demonstrates that natural disasters 
have been increasing in Canada, including 
events associated with flooding, wind, 
and wildfires (Institute for Catastrophic Loss 
Reduction, 2012). 

While many factors, other than 
climate change, contribute to rising 
insurance losses (including exposure of 
property, increasing wealth, and aging 
infrastructure), this trend demonstrates 
a pattern of infrastructure vulnerability 
in Canada to extreme weather events 
(Warren and Lemmen, 2014).   

Extreme weather events are not the only climate risk to transportation. Other risks to the Canadian 
transportation system, associated with a changing climate, include the following: 

• 

Temperature changes and fluctuations contribute to infrastructure deterioration and operational 
challenges, especially in permafrost regions of northern Canada, but also across southern Canada 
due to changing freeze-thaw cycles during the winter and heat waves during the summer.

•  Changing ice conditions affect marine operations and vessel navigation, especially in northern 

Canada, with broad implications (both positive and negative) for economic development, trade, 
and security.  

•  Sea level rise and storm events can increase risks of coastal erosion, flooding, and associated 

damage, with implications for transportation infrastructure and operations in coastal areas of Canada.  

•  Low inland water levels (particularly in the Great Lakes) can reduce vessel capacity, and create 

navigation difficulties.

ADAPTATION OPTIONS

Adaptation options for transportation may include engineering and technological solutions, as well as 
policy, planning, management, and maintenance approaches. Some examples, from the chapters in 
this report, include:

•  Changing pavement mixes for roads, for example using more heat-tolerant pavements; 

•  Expanding drainage capacity for infrastructure, including culvert size;

• 

Increasing maintenance, including clearing debris from culverts to reduce flooding risks, and 
clearing snow to preserve permafrost stability under vulnerable roads;

 
CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTIONS

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016• 

Implementing heaters and cooling fans to improve 
tolerance of traffic signal controllers to extreme 
temperatures, and thermosyphons to maintain 
permafrost stability at airports;

•  Changing infrastructure design requirements to include 

climate change considerations or to introduce new flood 
event thresholds; 

•  Elevating or relocating new infrastructure where feasible; 

•  Changing engineering procedures, such as increasing 

temperature thresholds for rail track to reduce risk of 
buckling during large temperature differentials;

• 

• 

Increasing monitoring of weather events and 
infrastructure conditions;  

Implementing or enhancing travel advisories and alerts 
to communicate travel conditions and service delays 
during weather events.

There are two categories of response 
to climate change – mitigation and 
adaptation. 

Mitigation refers to human 
interventions to reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions.  

Adaptation refers to any activity 
that reduces the negative impacts 
of climate change and/or takes 
advantage of new opportunities. 
This includes actions taken before 
impacts are observed (anticipatory), 
and after impacts have been felt 
(reactive). Adaptation can be 
planned (i.e., the result of deliberate 
policy decisions), or spontaneous, 
in the case of reactive adaptation 
(Warren and Lemmen, 2014).

Transportation plays a critical role in the movement of goods and people in Canada, supporting 

all sectors of the economy and Canadians’ quality of life. The effects of a changing climate and 

extreme weather present both risks and opportunities to transportation infrastructure and operations. How 
Canadians adapt to these changes will be important to ensure the continued prosperity of our nation.   

This Synthesis summarizes findings from the seven core chapters of the report Climate Risks and 
Adaptation Practices for the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016, and presents examples of 
regional climate impacts, specific modal impacts (e.g., road, rail, marine, air and urban systems), 
and adaptation approaches being undertaken across Canada. (References for the examples 
presented in this chapter appear throughout the report.)

The following present high-level conclusions from the report:

• 

Transportation infrastructure, essential to Canada’s domestic and international trade, is 
vulnerable to damage and disruptions from a changing climate and extreme weather, and 
this can pose risks to other sectors of the economy. Studies are underway to better understand 
these vulnerabilities, and adaptive practices are being undertaken to reduce future impacts. 
Regional chapters provide further details on initiatives related to the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence 
Seaway, the Chignecto Isthmus (highway and rail), Port Metro Vancouver, Port Saint John, and 
other trade infrastructure. 

•  Climate and weather-related delays and disruptions to passenger travel could become more 

frequent in future. These events can temporarily isolate remote communities in northern regions, 
which may rely on a single highway or airport for connectivity, and lead to costly damages 
and travel disruptions for large urban areas. Redundancies in transportation systems (allowing 
multiple methods of travel) are one method to reduce these impacts. 

•  Northern transportation systems are experiencing some of the greatest impacts from warming, 

and temperatures will continue to increase at a faster rate than any other region in Canada.  
Degrading (thawing) permafrost has caused damage to roads, railways, and airport taxiways 
and runways, and will continue to pose risks to transportation safety, efficiency, and maintenance 
budgets in the North. The operating windows and capacities of some winter (ice) roads have also 
shortened in recent years, resulting in the need for alternative methods of shipping.  

•  A changing climate is expected to result in some opportunities for Canadian transportation. 

Potential benefits include longer marine navigation and construction seasons, reduced winter 
maintenance, greater operating efficiency for rail, and improved fuel efficiency for all modes.  
Melting sea ice is also slowly opening up arctic waters to new navigation routes, however, 
the increased mobility of summer sea ice, as well as increased coastal erosion and storm 
surge flooding, present ongoing difficulties for shipping, exploration, and associated coastal 
infrastructure.

•  Reactive approaches to managing climate risks (e.g., responding to past impacts or events), 
remain common in Canada’s transportation sector. At the same time, examples can be found 
in all regions, and for all transportation modes, of actions being taken in anticipation of future 
climate conditions. Many owners and operators, both public and private, have adapted 
their operations based on investigations and lessons learned from past weather-related 
events. Transportation decision-makers are also more frequently engaging in pro-active planning.

• 

Transportation decision-makers are increasingly adopting a risk management approach to 
reduce climate risks to their infrastructure and operations. A variety of specific practices are 
being used to enhance climate resilience of transportation systems, including integration 
of climate considerations into organizational planning, policy and design changes, risk 
and vulnerability assessments, structural and physical adaptations, smart technologies and 
operational and maintenance changes.

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016REGIONAL CLIMATE RISKS 

While there is considerable variation in Canada’s climate, transportation systems across the nation 
share many of the same climate risks; practitioners can therefore learn from each other’s experiences.  
Risks common to all regions include extreme weather events (particularly heavy precipitation) 
and extreme and fluctuating temperatures. Extreme events have affected communities across 
the country, including large urban centres, costing billions in disaster-related losses. Provinces and 
territories with marine coasts face common risks associated with storm surge flooding, sea-level 
changes, and coastal erosion. Canada’s northern regions, including the three territories and the 
northern parts of several provinces, all face risks associated with thawing permafrost. 

Examples of past impacts to each region’s transportation system from climate change and extreme 
events are depicted in Figure 1. These impacts are characteristic of many, though not all, of the future 
risks these regions face.

Similar to regional climate risks, Canada’s four major modes of transportation – road, rail, marine, 
and air – share many common risks to their infrastructure and operations. Furthermore, due to the 
integration of transportation modes and their physical proximity to one another, weather impacts that 
adversely affect one mode of transportation tend to have negative impacts on others. An example is 
the history of simultaneous and sequential failure of highways and rail lines in British Columbia, which 
often run in parallel along mountain corridors and rivers.

Each transportation mode also faces unique risks. The sections below depict some of the ways that 
climate and weather can affect road, rail, marine, air, and urban transport systems in Canada, based 
on the findings in this report.  (Note: Drawings are for illustration purposes only and not intended to be 
technically accurate). 

ROAD TRANSPORT

Climate and weather-related impacts on road transportation (Figure 2) can compromise safety 
and efficiency, disrupt operations, and increase maintenance and operational costs. Anticipated 
changes to some climate variables can also provide benefits to road transport. For example, warmer 
winter temperatures can lead to greater fuel efficiency for vehicles, longer construction seasons, and 
reduced winter maintenance requirements.

Similar to road transportation, the safety, efficiency, and reliability of rail transportation can be 
compromised by the climate impacts illustrated in Figure 3. Extreme precipitation and coastal storm 
surges can cause washouts, while both permafrost degradation and temperature extremes can 
necessitate slower train speeds and potentially cause derailments. At the same time, warming winter 
temperatures, which are projected throughout Canada, may reduce track and mechanical issues 
caused by extreme cold.

Many of the impacts to air transport illustrated in Figure 4 can lead to flight delays, diversions and 
cancellations. Few accidents are caused by weather conditions in the absence of other contributing 
factors. Instrument landing systems and other innovations allow aircraft to fly safely in difficult weather 
conditions, and aircraft are grounded in conditions considered unsafe for flight. Climate risks to airport 
infrastructure tend to present greater challenges for smaller airports in Canada, which lack the same 
technologies and resources as larger airports.

 • Extreme precipitation (weakened embankments, 

depressions)

 • High winds
 • Extreme precipitation
 • Extreme precipitation
 • Freezing rain
 • Extreme high temperatures

 • Extreme fog (low visibility)
 • Wind (strong cross-winds/tailwinds affect some runways)
 • Extreme temperatures (heat and cold)

 • Changing precipitation conditions

The impacts illustrated in Figure 5 can disrupt marine transportation and compromise the efficiency 
of port and shipping activities. For example, lower water levels on inland waterways can reduce 
the cost-effectiveness of marine shipping by decreasing the capacity of vessels, and result in a shift 
to other ports or other modes of transportation. Hazards to marine navigation from changing ice 
conditions and storm events can pose safety risks. Ports along Canada’s Atlantic and Pacific coasts 
are subject to impacts from sea level rise and storm surges, and some may also be vulnerable to 
coastal erosion. Warming temperatures can result in opportunities for marine transport, including a 
longer operating season and potentially open up shipping routes in Arctic waters, however, this is 
tempered by continuing challenges to navigation and safety posed by mobile summer sea ice and 
older, thicker ice.

EXAMPLES OF IMPACTS ON 

MARINE TRANSPORT

① Flooding and/or damage to port 

facilities

② Increased or reduced access to 

ports, dredging requirements 

CLIMATE FACTOR(S)

 • Extreme precipitation (heavy rainfall) and associated standing 

water

 • Storm surges/sea level rise, erosion in coastal areas
 • Freezing rain (ice-scour damage on dock structures and visual 

navigational aids) 

 • Low water levels (damage and accelerated decay of 

exposed infrastructure)

 • Increasing sea levels (e.g., Atlantic Canada and British 

Columbia) permitting entry of heavier vessels (deeper drafts)   

 • High water levels inhibiting passage of vessels under bridges
 • Decreasing sea levels (e.g., Hudson Bay) and lower freshwater 

levels (e.g., Great Lakes) inhibiting access by heavier vessels 

③ Hazards to vessel navigation – 
storms and wind events (waves)

 • Wave action (difficulty maneuvering vessels)
 • Melting sea ice (open water worsening the impact of storms 

and wind events)

④ Hazards to vessel navigation – 

detached sea ice

⑤ Longer or shorter shipping season 

⑥ New navigation opportunities 

 • Melting ice (detached sea ice moving into unexpected 

areas)

 • Earlier ice break-up/later freeze-up (longer navigation 

season), later ice break-up/earlier freeze-up (shorter season)
 • Melting sea ice (creating open water where navigation was 

previously not possible)

Impacts to urban transportation systems (Figure 6) include many of the same issues and 
opportunities identified for road and rail systems in the sections above.  Risks more unique to urban 
systems are associated with underground transit systems and electrical systems. Weather-induced 
shifts between modes of passenger transport are also more relevant in an urban context. For 
example, extreme temperatures, precipitation, and strong winds all reduce the percentage of trips 
taken by walking or cycling.

ADAPTATION APPROACHES

Transportation owners and operators are using a variety of different approaches to reduce climate 
risks, including: 

• 

Integrating climate considerations into organizational planning, policies and designs - known as 
“mainstreaming”, this refers to the practice of systematically considering climate risks in broader 
organizational plans and requirements.

•  Undertaking risk and vulnerability assessments - processes that assess the vulnerability of 

transportation infrastructure and operations to climate change and associated risks. Results can 
inform investments and operational decisions. 

• 

• 

Implementing structural and physical (engineering) adaptations - solutions that enhance the 
physical resiliency of transportation networks or infrastructure components. In some cases, 
structural adaptations are part of broader climate adaptation strategies and programs.

Integrating smart technologies - monitoring and communications technologies and tools, these 
can provide climate and weather data to support adaptation decision-making, and allow real-
time monitoring of asset conditions.

•  Changing operations and maintenance practices - this category of approaches is often the most 

cost-effective to implement.

Adaptation Activities

Organizational planning, policies and designs

The BC Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure requires infrastructure design 
work to consider climate change adaptation, and has developed a set of 
notional best-practices. 
TransLink, Vancouver’s regional transportation authority, has integrated 
responsibility for climate change risks into its financial management processes.
Port Saint John’s long-term port modernization plans are accounting for sea 
level rise.
Jurisdictions, such as the City of Sept-Îles are using zoning requirements to control 
coastal land use and are undertaking cost-benefit analysis for threatened 
structures. 
Several jurisdictions are updating design flows and return periods for stormwater 
management networks, including culverts, to account for an increased frequency 
and/or magnitude of heavy precipitation events in the future.

Structural and physical (engineering) adaptations

The New Brunswick Department of Transportation rebuilt and raised a bridge 
on the main road into Pointe-du-Chêne to accommodate future sea level rise 
scenarios.
The Quebec Ministry of Transportation has oversized the diameter of culverts by 
10% to help manage heavy precipitation events.
Norman Wells Airport and Ottawa International Airport have grooved their 
runways to improve traction and drainage during heavy precipitation.
Transportation practitioners are implementing and testing engineering techniques, 
such as thermosyphons, to reduce permafrost thaw under infrastructure, and are 
using fiber optic technologies to monitor permafrost degradation.
Roads in Ontario are using the “SuperPave” system to determine optimal 
pavement mixtures for local temperature conditions.
GO Train engineers are increasing the preferred rail-laying and rail-distressing 
temperatures for track, in order to reduce buckling risks to rail lines from high 
temperatures.

Smart technologies

Provinces are using Road Weather Information Systems (RWIS) to inform operations 
and maintenance, trucking firms are monitoring real-time weather events in their 
networks to enable efficient re-routing.
Wind sensors are being installed on some rail bridges, allowing rail operators to 
delay passage or adjust speeds, in the Greater Toronto Area, Metrolinx and GO 
Transit have installed flood sensors in transit corridors. 
Railway companies are actively monitoring weather events, climate risks, and 
asset health by installing washout detectors and laser movement detection 
systems, using fiber optics to detect slope movements, measuring track stability 
with radar interferometer, and installing warning systems for extreme weather.
Marine ports, such as Port Saint John, are using real-time weather and wave 
forecasting tools, including the “SmartAtlantic” inshore weather buoy, to support 
planning and navigation.
Vessel operators in the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Seaway System are using 
Onboard Draft Information systems and other electronic navigation services to 
support operations in low water conditions, in Arctic waters, vessels are using 
radar and satellite technology to provide near real-time ice charts, images and 
forecasts.
The Quebec Geomatics Centre and the Ministry of Public Security have 
implemented an online interactive mapping tool (GéoRISC portal) for the 
Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region, to allow decision-makers to limit and reduce 
flooding impacts and ultimately plan for alternative road routes.

Operations and maintenance requirements and practices

To maintain the integrity of winter roads in Northern Canada, operators are 
spraying roads and bridges and are constructing snow caches at key points along 
the winter roads, for repair purposes.
The City of Toronto is more regularly monitoring and clearing drainage culverts to 
prevent issues during extreme precipitation events.
The Quebec Ministry of Transportation has introduced a thermal monitoring 
program for 13 airport runways in Nunavik. They are built on land sensitive to 
permafrost thaw.
Some jurisdictions are using combination ploughing and salting vehicles to better 
react to freezing rain conditions.
Carriers at northern airports have developed portable de-icing mechanisms to 
more flexibly address aircraft icing requirements.
Trucking firms are using technologies to reduce fuel consumption that also enhance 
climate resilience. Aerodynamic devices (fairings and trailer skirts) can improve the 
stability  of  trucks  during  wind  events,  and  auxiliary  power  units  (APUs)  can  help 
truckers respond to increased frequency of cold snaps or heat waves.

Figure 7: Engineers Canada PIEVC Protocol 
Process. (Source: Engineers Canada)

While engineers have long considered climate 
parameters in engineering design work, this 
has usually meant looking back at historic 
trends. Given the current rate of climate 
change, this is no longer a reliable approach.  
Provincial Professional Engineering Associations 
are responding by adding new professional 
requirements to ensure that potential climate 
change impacts are taken into account in the 
design process for the service life expected 
of the infrastructure.  This is a cultural change 
for agencies responsible for infrastructure, 
consultants carrying out engineering design 
work and clients commissioning the work.  It is 
expected that future engineering work related 
to new infrastructure design and rehabilitation 
will reflect such action and progress. 

The Public Infrastructure Engineering 
Vulnerability Committee (PIEVC) Engineering 
Protocol, led by Engineers Canada, was 
developed as a 5-step process to analyze 
the engineering vulnerability of individual 
infrastructure systems based on current climate 
and future climate projections. Since 2012, the 
Protocol has been applied to a wide variety 
of infrastructure types, including roads and 
airports.

CONCLUSION

The research conducted for this report suggests that a changing climate and extreme weather are 
affecting all modes of transportation in every region of Canada, and that many climate risks are 
increasing. The adaptive efforts being undertaken to date speak to the willingness of Canada’s 
governments, agencies, and private sector to confront the risks to transportation safety, efficiency 
and reliability posed by a changing climate. At the same time, gaps and barriers remain, including 
limitations in localized climate projections, and resource and capacity constraints, particularly in 
Canada’s North. Advancements in science and technology, along with training, tools and guidance 
for practitioners, have the potential to help the sector respond to these challenges. Coordination 
across jurisdictional boundaries, and with industry and researchers, will be important to advance 
adaptation solutions and enhance the resilience of the sector in the face of these growing risks.

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016KEY FINDINGS

• 

The Canadian North has experienced some of the most significant warming on the planet. From 
1948 to 2014, the Arctic Tundra region warmed by 2˚C, while the Arctic Mountains and Fjords 
region of Nunavut experienced a temperature increase of 1.6˚C. The greatest warming (2.6°C) 
occurred in the Mackenzie District. These changes have considerable impacts on the people, 
land, ecosystems, and infrastructure. 

•  Permafrost degradation poses both immediate and future risks to northern transportation 

infrastructure. Warming temperatures have increased the vulnerability of roads, railways, and 
airport taxiways and runways to risks associated with ground settlement, slope instability, and 
buckling. Continued warming will further degrade permafrost, with implications for transportation 
safety, system efficiency, community services, and maintenance budgets in the North.

•  Changes to the regional climate have reduced the operating windows and load capacities of 
some winter roads in recent years, in some cases resulting in costly adjustments. Winter roads 
serve as a key seasonal component of some territories’ transportation infrastructure (particularly in 
the Northwest Territories) and are critical for community re-supply. While operating windows have 
always been variable from year to year, recent increases in surface temperature have shortened 
the operating season for some winter roads. This has resulted in the need for alternative, and often 
more costly, methods of shipping, such as air transportation.  

• 

The climatic changes that are opening up northern marine waters to exploration and shipping are 
also making these activities more difficult. Increasing temperatures have led to a rapid decrease 
in sea ice extent, and reduced volumes of multi-year sea ice.  While these changes are slowly 
opening up waterways to new navigational routes, the increased mobility of summer sea ice, 
as well as increased coastal erosion and storm surge flooding, present ongoing difficulties for 
shipping, exploration, and associated coastal infrastructure. 

•  While many adaptation techniques can be used to maintain roads, rail, and airport taxiways 
and runways on permafrost rich soil, some can be cost-prohibitive. Several practices rely on 
the availability of specialized equipment and materials, which can be expensive to transport to 
northern locations.

1.0 INTRODUCTION

Canada’s North is experiencing some of the most significant warming trends anywhere on the 
planet (Bush et al., 2014).  Changing temperatures, precipitation patterns and storm frequency are 
affecting northern ecosystems, livelihoods, and infrastructure, including transportation. In addition to 
withstanding harsh weather conditions, much of Canada’s northern infrastructure was designed and 
built to be operated within a range of site-specific environmental and climate conditions that are 
changing and will continue to change in coming years (National Round Table on the Environment 
and the Economy, 2009). In particular, the changing temperatures of the North are affecting the 
structural integrity of buildings, roads (both all-weather and seasonal), airport runways, rail and marine 
infrastructure, navigable waterways, and other infrastructure. In the most extreme circumstances, 
changes have contributed to infrastructure failure (Government of Nunavut et al., 2011). Changing 
temperatures are also affecting the length of winter road seasons, in some cases resulting in the need 
for alternative, more costly, shipping methods to reach remote communities (Government of Nunavut 
et al., 2011). Resulting disruptions to transportation operations can also affect community re-supply 
and food security. On the water, changing sea ice patterns have affected traditional food harvesting 
practices and marine shipping (Government of Nunavut et al., 2011).

 
CHAPTER 3: NORTHERN TERRITORIES

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Trends of warming temperatures and increasingly-severe storm events are projected to continue in 
the future. Although northern governments and practitioners have begun planning and adapting 
to climate change, additional practices and resilience-building strategies are needed to ensure the 
reliability and longevity of transportation infrastructure and systems in northern Canada. 

This chapter assesses the many challenges and opportunities for transportation, associated with 
climate change in Canada’s three northern territories – the Yukon, the Northwest Territories, and 
Nunavut. The chapter provides a regional overview of the territories’ distinct geography and 
transportation networks; discusses observed and projected changes in the northern climate; provides 
examples of associated impacts on transportation; describes adaptation practices to mitigate these 
impacts; and identifies gaps in knowledge and research that remain to be addressed regarding 
future climate risks and opportunities. This synthesis of information aims to enhance understanding of 
climate risks and adaptation practices within the transportation sector, and inform decision-making.

1.1 REGIONAL OVERVIEW

Canada’s North is characterized by its vast size; diverse and rugged landscape; harsh climate; frozen 
ground (i.e. permafrost); and seasonally frozen waterways and marine waters. The landscape of the 
North includes long coastlines, Canada’s highest mountain range (the Saint Elias in the Yukon), densely 
forested areas (across much of the Yukon and large parts of the Northwest Territories) and tundra 
(across all of Nunavut, large parts of the Northwest Territories, and the extreme north of the Yukon).   

While the capital cities of the three territories all have populations in excess of 7,000 people, the 
region’s many other communities generally feature small populations situated vast distances 
from one another, with many only reachable by air or water (see Table 1). These characteristics 
present challenges for transportation infrastructure and operations – and for economic and social 
development more broadly – in the North.

Canada, 2012a, b, c and Statistics Canada 2014).

The economies of the territories are predominantly resource-based – mining and oil and gas production 
are the region’s primary economic drivers. Mining activity and oil production in the Yukon and 
Northwest Territories are highly dependent upon road transport and systems for supplies and exports. This 
includes a number of key winter roads that support resource-development projects, particularly in the 
Northwest Territories (for example, the Tibbitt to Contwoyto Winter Road – see Case study 1). In contrast, 
economic activities in Nunavut are especially reliant upon sea-based transportation, as there are no 
roads connecting communities and moving goods by air is costly. In the future, marine transportation is 
expected to play an increased role in the economies of the territories. 

The North also has a vibrant social economy, with a diverse mix of people and cultures. In 2011, 52 
per cent of the population of the Northwest Territories, 86 per cent of Nunavut, and 17 per cent of 
the Yukon identified as Aboriginal (Statistics Canada, 2011). Many traditional ways of life for First 
Nations (e.g., hunting, fishing, trapping) require ease of movement across land, including accessible 
routes across snow and ice. Inuit, who have traditionally used sea ice as a “highway” to resources,

and harvest animals that have changed their migratory patterns (Inuit Circumpolar Council, 2008). 
Northern residents are also affected by high transportation costs, reflected in the prices of food, fuel, 
and other goods.

2.0 AN INTRODUCTION TO CANADA’S NORTHERN TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM

While territorial transportation networks are similar in some respects, each territory’s infrastructure 
has unique characteristics. For instance, Nunavut has no all-weather roads connecting it to southern 
Canada, relying instead on air and marine transportation. The Yukon depends primarily on road 
transportation, and has all-weather roads connecting all communities except for Old Crow. The 
Northwest Territories, meanwhile, depends on marine, rail, air, and road transportation (Table 2).

The frozen landscape offers opportunities for transportation, providing a seasonal foundation for 
winter roads. During the winter, sea, river, and lake ice can facilitate the movement of goods and 
people throughout the territories. However, operating windows for winter roads are limited, with 
roads typically only in operation from November/December until March/April (Prowse et al., 2009). In 
addition, permafrost conditions affect the stability of all-season transportation infrastructure, including 
roads and airport runways.

During the summer, navigable waters are used for shipping purposes, providing community resupply to 
remote areas. The air sector plays a significant role in all three territories and serves as the year-round 
link between northern communities and southern Canada for essential medical and evacuation 
services. 

In light of the risks to northern transportation systems posed by a changing climate (discussed in detail 
in subsequent sections), the need for adaptation related to transportation has been acknowledged 
by both federal and territorial governments. The Government of the Northwest Territories 
commissioned the development of a Climate Change Adaptation Plan for the Department of 
Transportation in 2013 (Deton’Cho-Stantec, 2013). Nunavut established the Nunavut Climate Change 
Centre, released a report on climate change impacts and adaptation, and collaborated with the 
Canadian Institute of Planners on an “adaptation planning toolkit” in 2011 (Government of Nunavut, 
2011; Bowron and Davidson, 2011). The Nunavut government also produced a report on engineering 
challenges for coastal infrastructure, including docks, in relation to the impacts of climate change 
(Journeaux Assoc., 2012).  Adaptation work is ongoing in the Yukon, particularly at Yukon College 
and through the Yukon Climate Change Secretariat (Northern Climate ExChange, 2014a and 2014b). 
Several of these efforts have been undertaken in collaboration with federal departments, including 
Transport Canada and Natural Resources Canada.

2.2 ROAD TRANSPORTATION2

In the Yukon, the land-based transportation network is relatively well-developed, with roads 
connecting all communities but one (Old Crow, the territory’s most northerly community, is linked to 
the continental mainland only seasonally via winter roads extending to Inuvik and Alaska). In contrast, 
few communities in the Northwest Territories and no communities in Nunavut are connected to 
southern Canada via the national highway system (Prolog Canada Inc., 2011). The all-weather road 
system in the Northwest Territories is being expanded through construction of a road from Tuktoyaktuk 
to Inuvik (expected to be completed in 2018) (Government of Northwest Territories, 2015a). In 
addition, ferry services have been added on the Peel and Mackenzie Rivers, and there are plans to 
extend the all-weather Mackenzie Highway further north. This highway extension would reduce the 
need for winter road use and yield potential economic benefits for communities along the route from 
Wrigley to Tuktoyaktuk (Yukon Government et al, 2008).

transportation network. Goods transported include bulk fuel, dry goods, building material and other 
items with a maximum truck load capacity of 64,000 kg (Federal, Provincial, and Territorial Sub-
Working Group on Northern Transportation, 2015). In the Yukon, winter roads facilitate community 
transportation (Deton’Cho-Stantec, 2013). There is no winter road system in Nunavut; however, the 
Government of Nunavut is assessing the feasibility of developing a seasonal network connecting 
the Kivalliq region with northern Manitoba (Brownie, 2013). Winter roads are much less costly than 
all-weather roads, and have a much smaller environmental footprint (Transportation Association of 
Canada, 2010). While a 9m-wide all-weather road in the Northwest Territories can range from CAD$1.2 
million to CAD$1.5 million per km (with maintenance costs up to CAD$15,000/km/year), winter roads 
range in cost from CAD$10,000 to CAD$20,000/km/season to open and operate (Transportation 
Association of Canada, 2010).   

Figure 2:  Road network in the Yukon and Northwest Territories.

2.3 AVIATION

For communities not connected by all-weather or winter roads, air transportation is vital. This is 
especially true in Nunavut and the Northwest Territories, where aviation ensures community resupply 
and transportation year-round. To illustrate its predominance, consider that more than 110,000 people 
departed from and disembarked at the Iqaluit airport in 2006, despite a population of approximately 
6,000 at the time (Dunlavy et al., 2009). While Yukon communities are not as heavily dependent 
on air travel due to the territory’s extensive road network, aviation remains important for isolated 
communities like Old Crow. 

 
CHAPTER 3: NORTHERN TERRITORIES

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016While some runways in the territories are paved, the vast majority are gravel. Paved and gravel 
runways have different sensitivities to climate (in particular to changes in ground conditions), and 
therefore require different adaptation methods. However, while gravel runways may be easier to 
maintain in a northern context, no new-generation jet aircraft are certified to operate on non-paved 
surfaces (Parliament of Canada, 2011). The Boeing 737-200, which has not been manufactured since 
the 1980s, is the most modern gravel-kitted aircraft. However, this model has higher fuel consumption 
and upkeep costs compared to more modern aircraft (Parliament of Canada, 2011).

2.4 MARINE TRANSPORTATION

Marine transportation is also important for community resupply (e.g., the transportation of food and 
fuel) during shipping months in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut. Despite its coastline along 
the Beaufort Sea, the Yukon has no marine-based facilities, although there is docking infrastructure 
along the Yukon River. While marine shipping is more cost-effective than air shipping in Nunavut, it 
is often hampered by a lack of port infrastructure and difficult conditions on the water. Cambridge 
Bay has basic facilities, and only Pangnirtung has a harbour facility. Inland marine transportation 
from Hudson Bay to Baker Lake (via the Chesterfield Narrows) is used to deliver fuel and construction 
supplies by barge and tanker to support the construction and operation of the Meadowbank gold 
mine (Transportation Safety Board of Canada, 2012). There are also plans to expand marine usage in 
some places. At Pond Inlet, a new marine and small craft harbour is planned; this would increase the 
community’s capacity for resupply of food, fuel and other goods (Government of Canada, 2015). 
Additionally, the Iqaluit Marine Infrastructure Project – involving the construction of a port and sea lift 
facility – aims to reduce offloading times and improve worker safety (Government of Nunavut, 2015).  

The Northwest Territories has an extensive network of river transportation vessels and facilities used for 
community resupply. The Mackenzie River acts as an important cargo shipment route for transporting 
goods to communities along the river, the Mackenzie Delta, the coast of the Beaufort Sea and the 
interior of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (Deton’Cho-Stantec, 2013). Additionally, some suggest 
that marine facilities in Tuktoyaktuk harbour once used to support oil and gas activities in the Beaufort 
Sea could be revamped to support offshore activity and search and rescue operations (Matthews, 
2014). However, the port is not suitable for larger vessels and currently features a shallow 32-km 
channel approach with sections less than 4m deep (Prolog Canada Inc, 2011).

2.5 RAIL TRANSPORTATION

Rail infrastructure is limited in the territories, but provides important services in some locations. 
For example, Canadian National (CN) Railway runs one return bulk commodity train daily to 
Enterprise and Hay River, Northwest Territories, that supplies the community and mining industry 
(Yukon Government et al, 2008). The line is one of the most costly routes in CN’s network due to the 
challenging area of service; for instance, the rail bed is constructed on permafrost, which limits train 
speed (Government of Northwest Territories, 2015a). Maintaining this service is important, however – 
over half of all bulk commodities entering the territory do so by rail (e.g., petroleum, agriculture and 
forest products) (Government of Northwest Territories, 2011).

The only rail line operating in the Yukon is the White Pass and Yukon Route, which operates as a 
tourist train from Carcross, Yukon to Skagway, Alaska (White Pass and Yukon Route, 2015). However, 
this may change: a study has been completed investigating the feasibility of a rail link from Alaska 
and the Yukon to the North American rail grid. This route would provide an alternative North 
American gateway to the Pacific Rim via ports in northern British Columbia and Alaska (Yukon 
Government et al, 2008).

Canada’s northern territories are characterized by long cold winters interrupted by short, relatively 
cool, summers. Precipitation is light, particularly in the western and northern parts of the region, and 
occurs predominantly in the summer months.  There is great regional variability in both seasonal 
temperatures and precipitation. For example, average winter temperatures in the northern part of the 
region are around -37˚C, but only -18˚C in the south (Environment Canada, 2015). Average summer 
temperatures range from 16˚C in the south to 6˚C in the north. Variability among seasons, years, and 
decades is high.

A critical component of the northern climate system is the cryosphere – terrestrial, freshwater, and 
marine areas that are seasonally or permanently frozen. This includes snow, glaciers, and permafrost, 
as well as lake, river and sea ice. Many of the most dramatic climate change impacts observed in 
Canada’s North relate to changes in the cryosphere (Derksen et al, 2012). A final element of the 
northern climate system is the marine climate. While changes in ocean temperature, salinity, and 
other parameters have important implications for northern ecosystems and traditional ways of life, this 
chapter only considers changes in sea level as it affects coastal transportation infrastructure.

WHAT IS ARCTIC AMPLIFICATION?

Arctic amplification refers to the faster rate of 
warming that characterizes Arctic regions relative 
to the rest of the world (Figure 3). While many 
factors contribute to this phenomenon, one key 
factor is the increased surface absorption of heat 
associated with reductions in snow and sea ice 
cover. Snow and ice are highly reflective, whereas 
the darker surfaces of open water and tundra 
absorb heat, causing greater warming (National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration, 2013).

Figure 3: Global temperature anomalies for 2000 
to 2009, showing how much warmer (red) or 
colder (blue) a region is compared to the norm 
for that region from 1951 to 1980. While average 
global temperatures from 2000-2009 were about 
0.6°C higher than they were from 1951–1980, the 
Arctic warmed by about 2°C. (Source: Courtesy 
NASA/JPL-Caltech)

3.1 TRENDS AND PROJECTIONS

3.1.1 ATMOSPHERE

Arctic regions have warmed, and will continue 
to warm, more rapidly than most regions of the 
world, due in part to the phenomenon known 
as Arctic amplification (see textbox). Canada’s 
North has already experienced some of the most 
significant surface air temperature warming 
observed anywhere on the planet (Bush, et al., 
2014). The greatest observed warming, 2.6˚C for the 
period 1948-2014, has occurred in the Northwest 
Territories’ Mackenzie District (Environment Canada, 
2015). Over the same period, the warming trend 
in Canada was 1.6˚C, and about 0.8˚C globally. 
Warming over the rest of northern Canada was 
equal to or greater than warming observed over 
the country as a whole for the period 1948-2014, 
with warming of 2˚C observed in the Arctic Tundra 
region, and 1.6˚C for the Arctic Mountains and 
Fjords region of Nunavut. 

Projections suggest that warming of the North 
will continue to be greater than in Canada as 
a whole, with the greatest warming occurring 
in winter and fall (Bush et al., 2014). In climate 
change models, the magnitude of warming 
for the latter part of this century is strongly 
dependent upon the level of global greenhouse 
gas emissions.  Under a high-emissions scenario, 
winter warming in excess of 10˚C is projected 
for large areas of the North.   Even under a low 
emissions scenario, average winter temperatures 
will increase by more than 5˚C.

 
CHAPTER 3: NORTHERN TERRITORIES 

36
36

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016All regions of northern Canada have also shown increases in precipitation since 1948, with very 
high variability from one year to the next (Prowse et al., 2009). While the region is dominated by 
cold air masses in winter, increased variability in the jetstream in recent years (Francis and Vavrus, 
2012) has resulted in more winter warm-air advection events in the North (winds blowing from 
warmer regions) (Wang, 2006). This can bring freezing rain, fog and melt events, which cause 
problems for transportation systems. Climate projections indicate that precipitation will continue 
to increase under all scenarios, with the greatest increases in fall and winter. Winter precipitation 
increases greater than 25 percent are projected for parts of the eastern and central Arctic by the 
year 2050 (Bush et al., 2014). 

There is strong evidence that the frequency and intensity of storms in the Arctic is increasing (Manson 
and Solomon, 2007). Increasingly-large areas of open water result in more intense cyclonic storms 
– these storms will grow larger and stronger as sea-ice extent is projected to decrease even further 
(Simmonds and Keay, 2009). Storms are most common in the eastern Arctic, associated with the Baffin 
Bay storm track. There are many recent examples of severe wind events, including a 2006 event in 
Pangnirtung, Nunavut, where winds reaching 125 km/hr destroyed a building and broke windows 
(Hanesiak et al., 2010). During a similar 2007 event in Iqaluit, Nunavut, winds reaching up to 140 km/hr 
tore sections off the roofs of multiple buildings (Hanesiak et al., 2010). Storm surges, where water levels 
exceed predicted tide levels due to atmospheric pressure and winds associated with storms, are of 
particular concern along the Beaufort Sea coast due to its shallow depth. Several sites in that region 
have recorded storm surges in excess of 2 m (Forbes and Frobel, 1985), with impacts extending 30 km 
inland on the Mackenzie Delta (Kokelj, et al., 2012). When storm surges occur during periods of full ice 
cover, “pressure ridges” can result that alter the sea floor near the shore, potentially affecting access 
to coastal facilities.

3.1.2 CRYOSPHERE

Dramatic changes have been observed in all elements of the cryosphere, and the rate of change 
has been accelerating in recent years (Derksen et al., 2012). These changes include decreases in 
the extent and duration of snow cover over the past 40 years, and a strong shift towards negative 
mass balance (loss of ice volume) in Arctic glaciers and ice caps since 2005 (Derksen et al., 2012). 
Of particular relevance to northern transportation are changes in sea ice, permafrost, and river 
and lake ice cover.

Sea ice is one of the most defining features of Canada’s North (Ford et al., 2016). In winter, when ice 
cover is essentially complete, the coast is protected from wave action, and ice permits transportation 
between communities and access to hunting and fishing areas. When ice is in motion, wind and 
currents can cause ice flows to collide and form pressure ridges, making travel both through the water 
and over the ice more difficult. Thick multi-year sea ice associated with the break-up of ice islands 
and icebergs generated by calving glaciers also present significant hazards for marine shipping 
(Prowse, et al, 2009). 

For the Arctic as a whole, the average extent of sea ice in the month of September is decreasing 
at a rate of 13.3 percent per decade, while March extent is decreasing at a rate of 2.6 percent per 
decade (National Snow and Ice Data Centre, 2016) (Figures 4a, b, c). In the Canadian Arctic, the 
rate of loss ranges from 2.9 percent per decade in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (CAA) (although 
areas within the CAA have much higher rates) to 10.4 percent per decade in Hudson Bay (Tivy, et 
al., 2011). This decline in sea-ice cover has resulted in a lengthening of the open-water season by an 
average of five days per decade Arctic-wide since 1979 (Stroeve, et al., 2014), and by 3.2–12 days 
per decade in the Canadian North. For example, in Resolute Bay, Nunavut, the melt season has 
increased by close to 30 days over a 30-year period, driven primarily by a delay in freeze-up (St-
Hilaire-Gravel et al., 2011). The decrease in the extent of sea ice means that larger and more powerful 
waves are reaching the coast (Overeem et al, 2011). This in turn, leads to increased erosion and 
flooding (Solomon et al., 1994). The greatest increase in fetch (length of open water) generally occurs 
in September, which is often also the stormiest period of the year (Atkinson, 2005).

continue or accelerate (Vaughn et al., 2013), with 
some models projecting almost complete loss of 
summer ice cover before mid-century (Wang and 
Overland, 2012). Arctic sea ice is also thinning, 
with the average spring ice thickness projected 
to decrease from 2.4 m in 2008 (Kwok et al., 2009) 
to 1.4 m by 2050 (Stroeve et al., 2012).

magenta line depicting median September ice extent for the period of record (National Snow and 
Ice Data Center, 2016).  The decreases in minimum ice extent have been much more dramatic than 
have changes in maximum ice extent.

Permafrost – which is permanently frozen ground – underlies virtually all of Canada’s northern territories. 
It can be continuous or discontinuous, or occur only in patches (Smith and Burgess, 2004). Permafrost 
can be up to several hundred metres thick, but may be only tens of metres thick or less in more southerly 
parts of the permafrost zone. Above the permafrost, a surface layer (known as the active layer) thaws 
in summer and refreezes in winter. The active layer can range from tens of centimetres to several metres 
in thickness. Climate (including air temperature and snow cover) is the main factor controlling the 
occurrence and thermal state of permafrost. Changes in climate can result in permafrost warming and 
thaw.  Warming of permafrost reduces the structural integrity of infrastructure that relies on permafrost 
for a stable foundation, while thawing of ice-rich permafrost leads to surface subsidence (sinking), 
hydrological changes and slope instability. This presents risks to infrastructure, roads, airstrips, and railways. 

A number of comprehensive overviews of the state of permafrost in Canada (Burn and Kokelji, 
2009) indicate that, with few exceptions, permafrost temperatures are increasing. Generally, colder 
permafrost situated further north has seen greater increases in temperature than warmer permafrost. 
Multi-decadal trends show warming of ground temperatures of between 0.2˚C per decade in the 
southern and central Mackenzie Valley to 1.2˚C per decade in the eastern Arctic (Figure 5). These 
rates appear to be increasing, with data for the period 2008 to 2013 showing average warming of 
1.5˚C per decade for 10 sites spanning a range of Arctic environments (Smith et al., 2013). Ground 
warming is also associated with an increase in the thickness of the seasonal active layer. 

These trends are projected to continue as the climate continues to warm (Woo et al., 2007). 
Regions that experience the greatest thermal responses, however, are not necessarily the ones 
that exhibit the greatest physical impacts (Smith and Burgess, 2004). For example, where there is 
a large increase in ground temperature but very low ground ice content, the physical impacts of 
permafrost warming will be minimal.

emissions scenario (RCP8.5; after James et

are described in Atkinson et al., 2016. (Source: 
Natural Resources Canada)

Air temperature also strongly influences the freeze-
up and break-up dates of river and lake ice, 
while changes in both air temperature and snow 
cover affect ice thickness (Brown and Duguay, 
2010).  Duration and thickness of ice cover are 
critical for the sustainability of many winter roads 
in Canada’s northern territories. Delayed freeze-
up, and earlier break-up dates observed in recent 
years are projected to continue, with simulations 
suggesting that by mid-century freeze-up will 
occur about 15 days later than it has historically, 
and that break-up will occur 5 to 25 days earlier. 
For the same period, maximum ice thicknesses are 
projected to decrease by 20 to 30 cm (Brown and 
Duguay, 2010).

3.1.3 SEA LEVEL 

Sea level changes in Canada’s northern 
territories are dominated by vertical land 
motion that has been ongoing since the last 
glaciation, when the land beneath ice sheets 
was depressed hundreds of metres, and has 
slowly been rebounding back over thousands of 
years (Atkinson et al., 2016). This phenomenon, 
known as glacial isostatic adjustment, results 
in observed sea level falling across most of the 
Canadian Arctic, despite the fact that global 
mean sea level has risen. An important exception 
is the Mackenzie Delta/Beaufort region of the 
western Arctic that lay near the margin of the 
last ice sheet and is experiencing sea level rise 
as a result. Tide-gauge records covering the past 
50 years indicate that sea level has risen 2.4 mm/
year at Tuktoyaktuk, NT, but fallen by 1.5 mm/
year at Alert, Nunavut (Ford et al, 2016).

Future patterns of sea level change will be 
similar to historic patterns, with the magnitude 
of change influenced by global greenhouse 
gas emissions and associated increases in mean 
global sea level.  Where the land is currently 
rising rapidly, future sea level is projected to 
continue to fall, even under a high greenhouse-
gas emissions scenario, and some locations 
could experience more than 80 cm of sea-level 
fall by 2100 (Figure 6). Where the land is sinking 
slowly, including the Mackenzie Delta/Beaufort 
region, sea level is projected to rise more than 
40 cm by 2100.  While not all of this change is 
due to a changing climate, adaptation will still 
be required. 

 
CHAPTER 3: NORTHERN TERRITORIES 

40
40

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016An important consequence of sea-level rise is the associated increase in extreme water-level events.  
For example, at Tuktoyaktuk, sea-level rise is projected to increase the frequency of an event that has 
historically occurred once every 25 years to once every 4 years by 2100. In other words, the flooding 
level associated with a one-in ten year event at Tuktoyaktuk is expected to increase from 1.1 m at 
present to 2.1 m by 2100 (Lamoureux et al., 2015).

While changes in sea level will have an impact on transportation and associated coastal infrastructure 
in the long term, particularly in the Mackenzie Delta/Beaufort region, near-term changes in sea-ice 
extent and duration will produce far more significant impacts on coastal erosion and flooding (Ford et 
al., 2016). Coastal erosion and related damage to infrastructure is already a significant issue for many 
communities in the western Arctic. For instance, Tuktoyaktuk has experienced such significant coastal 
erosion that several buildings, including the community school and police station, have been moved 
to ensure the safety of residents (Government of Nunavut et al., 2011).

4.0 ROAD IMPACTS AND ADAPTATION 

4.1 CLIMATE IMPACTS ON ROAD TRANSPORTATION

As discussed, roads are critical to the socioeconomic functioning of many northern communities. This 
section summarizes expected impacts on roads associated with different climatic factors.

4.1.1 ALL-SEASON ROADS

Warming temperatures in northern Canada have significant impacts on roads, especially those 
constructed on permafrost (Northern Climate ExChange, 2014b). Permafrost conditions are 
particularly challenging for engineers working at the southern limits of the North, where ground 
temperatures fluctuate between -1°C and 0°C. Warming and thawing of ice-rich permafrost can lead 
to ground settlement, slope instability, drainage issues, and road cracking (see Figure 7) (Montufar et 
al., 2011). For instance, Highway 3 in the Northwest Territories was designed to preserve permafrost, 
but the high volume of melt water due to warming temperatures was not taken into account and 
infrastructure failed as a result (Northern Climate ExChange, 2014b).

CHAPTER 3: NORTHERN TERRITORIES 

41
41

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Extreme precipitation events have also affected roads and bridges.  For example, heavy rains and 
flash flooding in Pangnirtung, Nunavut washed out a major community bridge, stranded 200 residents, 
and blocked access to important municipal services (CBC News, 2008). Field investigation determined 
that heavy rains, warmer-than usual-temperatures, the presence of ice-rich materials, and frost 
cracking were the main contributing factors (Hsieh et al., 2011).

4.1.2 WINTER ROADS

Higher temperatures also have a negative impact on winter roads, which may be constructed 
overland, across lake and river ice, or (in a few cases) sea ice fastened to the shore. While operating 
windows have always varied by location and year, recent increases in surface air temperature and 
decreases in snow cover have reduced operating season length and maximum load capacity 
in many locations (Furgal and Prowse, 2008). This resulted in a costly adjustment in 2006, when 
approximately 1,200 loads had to be transported by air during the summer and fall following a 
shortened winter-road season on the Tibbitt to Contwoyto Winter Road (Andrey et al., 2014). 

Drainage issues can also intensify in periods of extreme weather, as water flow can reduce the 
integrity of winter roads, bridges at stream crossings, and culverts. For example, sections of the 
Mackenzie Valley and Tlicho Winter Roads have experienced flooding and closure in recent years, 
and the Tlicho Winter Road has experienced shut downs in sections due to flooding (Deton’Cho-
Stantec, 2013). 

4.2 FUTURE RISKS

4.2.1 ALL-WEATHER ROADS

A significant threat to the integrity of roads throughout most of the territories is the continued 
degradation of ice-rich permafrost. This is expected to continue to cause issues related to ground 
settlement and road-embankment subsidence – over the long term, permafrost degradation may 
contribute to the failure of highway side slopes, increased sloughing (referring to the movement of 
supporting material downhill and away from the roadway) (Alberta Transportation, 2003), as well as 
the sinking and cracking of road shoulders (Deton’Cho-Stantec, 2013).

More frequent extreme rainfall events would exacerbate the potential for flooding in some areas, 
leading to road and bridge washouts, reduced friction, and drainage issues related to inadequate 
culvert sizing. High-volume snowmelt may also result in flooding and increase pore water pressure 
and erosion, damaging permafrost (IMG-Golder Corporation Environmental Consulting, 2012). This 
will have implications for roads, bridges at stream crossings, and slope stability. Territorial governments 
are aware of these risks and have been taking steps to increase the structural integrity of the ground 
underlying transportation infrastructure (discussed further in Section 4.3). In addition, snowfall and 
winter storm events limit visibility for drivers, and may result in road closures.

4.2.2 WINTER ROADS

As the climate warms, winter roads in the Canadian North, both public and private, are at risk due 
to shortened operating seasons and increased costs. Thinner lake, river, and marine ice will have 
a negative impact on the seasonal duration and stability of winter roads (Bush, et al., 2014), while 
changing permafrost conditions could impact the viability and structural integrity of some routes 
(McGregor et al., 2008).

The trend towards shorter operational seasons is already evident. For example, the average opening 
date for light traffic on the Mackenzie River Ice Bridge Crossing has been delayed, on average, 
by more than 3 weeks since 1996 (Frugal and Prowse, 2008). In the future, some winter routes 
may become impractical, although timing and locations have yet to be determined. Alternative 
transportation routes or modes will need to be considered in advance of reaching such thresholds 
(Frugal and Prowse, 2008) (see Case study 1).

CASE STUDY 1: IMPLICATIONS OF A CHANGING CLIMATE 
FOR THE TIBBITT TO CONTWOYTO WINTER ROAD 

The Tibbitt to Contwoyto Winter Road (TCWR; Figure 8) is a 570-km private industrial road (also used by the 
public) in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut. It provides access and supplies to three active diamond 
mines and other mining locations. The majority of the road is built over frozen lakes, and both the construction 
and operation of the road are sensitive to climate variations. Thus, winter warming trends have been 
identified as a concern for the longevity of the road.

TCWR Facts: 

• 

• 

The TCWR is the busiest heavy-haul winter road in the world, moving a record 10,922 loads (330,002 
tonnes) in 2007. It provides access to a region served by no other highways.

The minimum ice thickness required for very light loads is 70 cm, while 107 cm is required for maximum 
loading (42 tonnes). Ground-penetrating radar is used to measure ice thickness. 

•  Construction of the road takes approximately 5 to 6 weeks prior to opening each year.

• 

The TCWR is typically operational for 8 to 10 weeks, starting between January 26 and February 11 and 
ending between March 21 and April 16.

Climate trends: Analysis of regional climate data demonstrates that the TCWR’s operating season length 
correlates with temperature and related variables, including freezing-degree days, melting-degree days, and 
ice thickness – of these, the strongest indicator of a longer season is the accumulation of freezing-degree days. 
Winter temperatures in the region have increased significantly over recent decades (Figure 9); correspondingly, 
freezing-degree days and observed annual maximum ice thickness have both decreased, while melting-
degree days have increased.

Future projections are consistent with observed trends. Climate change scenarios (in the absence of 
adaptation measures) project that the length of the winter road operating season will decrease from 
approximately 65 days in 2010 to 58 days by 2020 and 49 days by 2050 (with a 6 to 8 day margin of error 
per season).

Adaptation costs: It is possible that the winter road will remain viable through 2050, although there may 
be significant costs associated with flexible scheduling and increased construction and maintenance 
requirements. These costs are estimated in the range of $55 to 155 million3 over a 35-year horizon.

There is also a significant risk of disruptions associated with late opening, early closure, or non-opening 
of the road. If the TCWR season length drops to fewer than 45 days, the road will no longer be able 
to accommodate an average season’s demand. This has direct implications for mine production. In 
these circumstances, the most significant costs are likely to be associated with a shift to other modes of 
transportation. The total estimated cost of this scenario over 35 years is approximately $213 million, with a 
maximum cost of $1.8 billion (consisting mainly of production losses). 

In summary, changes to the TCWR’s operational season length create significant economic risks for both 
operators and users, assuming demand for the road increases or remains stable. Improved understanding 
of climate thresholds and associated costs for road owners and users may help to inform future economic 
and vulnerability assessments for winter roads.

4.3 ADAPTATION PRACTICES

Adaptation practices for roads vary by season and type of road (e.g., all-weather vs. winter). 
Generally, adaptation approaches for northern roads fall under three major categories: maintenance 
and monitoring practices; infrastructure planning and siting; and construction techniques and 
technologies. 

4.3.1 MAINTENANCE AND MONITORING PRACTICES

4.3.1.1 All-weather roads

Ongoing monitoring of infrastructure conditions is important for identifying maintenance priorities, in 
preparation for gradual climatic changes and extreme weather events. In areas at risk of permafrost 
thaw, all-weather roads can be maintained through several methods, including clearing snow from 
vulnerable sections of roads built on permafrost (e.g., side slopes); conducting alternative routing 
assessments prior to reconstruction; and road-shoulder widening (Transportation Association of 
Canada, 2010). Culverts experiencing accelerated permafrost degradation can be replaced or 
expanded if runoff capacity is exceeded, and accompanying ditching/drainage may be enhanced 
in this event as well (Deton’Cho-Stantec, 2013). As permafrost thaws, all-weather roads that carry 
significant traffic – particularly heavy vehicles – will require greater maintenance compared to lower-
traffic routes.

Monitoring can also mitigate the impact of forest fires, which often result in the closure of road 
segments. While some delays are inevitable, a public notification system can help mitigate 
bottlenecks and other effects of closure. Monitoring ground conditions after a forest fire is also 
important, as fires typically have an impact on underlying permafrost (Semeniuk, 2014).

Practices to maintain the integrity of winter roads include the pre-emptive removal of snow, as 
well as the construction and maintenance of snow caches (stockpiles of snow used as supporting 
material for degraded segments of winter roads). Snow removal allows freezing fronts to penetrate 
the ground faster, removing heat from the ground and promoting ice formation, while snow caches 
constructed near difficult land crossings allow overland sections to be rebuilt quickly (Deton’Cho-
Stantec, 2013). To improve drainage, flattening side slopes on winter roads allows for the gentle 
removal of water away from the infrastructure (Deton’Cho-Stantec, 2013). Operational practices 
include spraying winter roads and bridges with water to thicken ice and delay closure. Towards the 
end of the operating season, some operators also restrict hauling to nighttime, when the ice sheet is 
stronger (Rawlings et al., 2009).

Several organizations have produced guiding documents to assist practitioners in the construction 
and maintenance of winter roads, including the Transportation Association of Canada (2011), the 
Government of the Northwest Territories (2015b and 2015c), the Canadian Standards Association 
Group (CSA, 2010), and the Standards Council of Canada’s Northern Infrastructure Standardization 
Initiative (2015). These guidelines discuss general ice safety, ice behaviour under loading, ice-cover 
management, and end-of-season management (among others). Methods to deal with ice cracking 
are also covered in detail to ensure the safety of crossing frozen bodies of water; these risks to roads 
can be mitigated over the long term by establishing permanent crossings, including bridges over 
“choke points” (points of congestion created by the layout of a network) (Rawlings et al., 2009). 
For example, the Deh Cho Bridge, which crosses a 1 km-wide section of the Mackenzie River, is 
designed to eliminate seasonal disruptions to road transportation when ice bridges and ferry services 
become unavailable (Office of the Auditor General of Canada, 2011). For winter roads traversing 
ice, temporary culvert crossings may also be converted to permanent culverts, including systems to 
handle higher flows (e.g., stacked culvert systems) (Deton Cho-Stantec, 2013). Additionally, alternate 
routes can be considered when segments of roadway become unreliable (Deton Cho-Stantec, 2013) 
(e.g., increasing the use of barge transportation, or constructing more expensive all-weather roads) 
(Furgal and Prowse, 2008).

4.3.2 INFRASTRUCTURE PLANNING/SITING 

The location of infrastructure is an important consideration for decision-makers, engineers, and 
planners in northern Canada. Critical baseline information includes data regarding local climate, 
permafrost conditions/sensitivity, and terrain constraints. Permafrost mapping and geotechnical 
monitoring, including assessments of soil type and ground ice content, are also conducted to avoid 
construction on overly sensitive ground (IMG-Golder Corporation Environmental Consulting, 2012). 
Improvements to permafrost databases and analysis of permafrost conditions could further support 
territorial governments in planning and decision-making, to permit greater understanding of methods 
to maintain transportation infrastructure on permafrost (Environment Yukon, 2009). Databases of this 
nature are maintained by the Geological Survey of Canada. 

Many of the guidance documents discussed previously are also useful when identifying optimal 
locations for both all-season and winter roads. Additionally, land-use guidelines applicable to road 
construction have been developed. These encourage proponents to consider northern Canada’s 
unique topography (i.e. pingos4 and permafrost), drainage, and vegetation, along with the social 
and economic impacts of proposed roadways, during project planning and design (Aboriginal Affairs 
and Northern Development Canada, 2010).

Several methods have been developed to preserve permafrost during construction (see Figure 10 
and Case study 2) (Beaulac and Doré, 2006). These methods have different cost implications (Table 
3) and functional objectives (limiting heat intake, extracting heat, and preserving the integrity of 
embankments).

created by www.soaringtortoise.ca.) 

Methods to limit heat intake under roads include:
①	 Embankment thickening (e.g., increasing width and flatness) helps maintain permafrost conditions 

in cold or moderately cold regions (although not in relatively warmer northern regions, as the 
active permafrost layer may be too thick). This method reduces heat penetration underneath 
the embankment (IMG-Golder Corporation Environmental Consulting, 2012). The material 
used to supplement the embankment is an important consideration; for example, polystyrene 
demonstrates long-term resistance to moisture and compression on roads and runways (Beaulac 
and Doré, 2006).

②	 Insulation materials (including polystyrene, polyurethane, foamed concrete, and expanded 
polystyrene block) can be used to preserve the structural integrity of roadways and prevent 
permafrost from cooling in the winter (Montufar et al., 2011).

③	 Snow/sun sheds protect embankment slopes from snow insulation, allow cold air to circulate during 
the winter, and eliminate direct solar radiation during the summer (Beaulac and Doré, 2006). Snow 
sheds have performed well in many locations, but require regular maintenance and present risks 
when overloaded with snow.

④	 Reflective surfaces (see also Figure 11), such as painting paved surfaces white, reduce the absorption of 
solar radiation. While proven effective, this method carries a high initial cost and can decrease traction 
on curves, intersections, and in braking zones after periods of rain (Beaulac and Doré, 2006).

The most common methods to extract heat from the ground during winter include: 

⑤	 Air convection ducts are located under embankments to allow for heat extraction though natural 

convection (IMG-Golder Corporation Environmental Consulting, 2012). These may be oriented in the 
direction of the prevailing wind or constructed horizontally (Transportation Association of Canada, 2010).

⑥	 Thermosyphons are passive cooling devices used to extract heat from the ground in winter and 

preserve the foundations of roads and buildings in ‘warm’ permafrost (see Figure 12). These systems, 
which have been used in the territories and northern Quebec, have been shown to cool the 
ground, raise the permafrost table, and stabilize foundations over time (Montufar, et al. 2011). While 
there have been problems with poorly functioning thermosyphons in the territories, these have 
been attributed to poor installation and maintenance. Figure 12 presents the mechanics behind this 
technology, and Figure 13 illustrates a thermosyphon in use at Inuvik Airport.

 

All varieties of thermosyphons (e.g., thermopiles, sloped-pipe thermosyphons, and flat-loop 
evaporator pipe thermosyphons) work on the same principle: a two-phase convection device 
extracts and discharges heat from the ground, cooling the permafrost. In winter, when the air is 
colder than the ground, thermosyphons cause gas in the above-ground pipe to condense and 
move to the base of the underground pipe. The cold air then drops the pipe’s fluid pressure, causing 
evaporation and completing the exchange of heat. During summer, low ground temperatures are 
maintained by a layer of insulation (Holubec, 2008).

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016⑦  Air convection embankments refer to the creation of embankments with clean, coarse, and 

poorly-graded rock (IMG-Golder Corporation Environmental Consulting, 2012). The resulting large, 
interconnected voids assist in air convection, extracting heat while maintaining the structural 
integrity of the embankment (IMG-Golder Corporation Environmental Consulting, 2012).

⑧	 Heat drains consist of permeable geocomposite material and a thin corrugate plastic cover placed 

underneath an embankment. These allow for heat extraction during winter as air flows through 
the layers (Montufar et al., 2011). Heat drains have been found to significantly reduce ground 
temperatures (Montufar et al., 2011).  

Methods to enhance the stability of embankments include:

⑨	 Geotextiles (i.e. permeable fabrics) reduce thaw-settlement by separating embankment fill and 

underlying soil, and by preventing embankment “spreading”. These materials are typically applied 
to areas that have a deep active layer and are poorly drained, in which mixing of subgrade soil and 
embankment fill is likely (Transportation Association of Canada, 2010).

⑩	 Berms (often with gentle slopes) protect low embankments from excessive thawing (Beaulac and 
Doré, 2006) by providing a physical barrier to the accumulation of snow, much like a snow fence 
(IMG-Golder Corporation Environmental Consulting, 2012). 

Additional reinforcement techniques involve pre-thawing permafrost to reduce the effects of freeze-
thaw settlement, and excavating/replacing ice-rich permafrost with fill (IMG-Golder Corporation 
Environmental Consulting, 2012).

CASE STUDY 2: TESTING TECHNIQUES TO PREVENT 
PERMAFROST THAW 

An experimental road section along a segment of the Alaska Highway was built in 2008 to test engineering 
techniques designed to prevent permafrost thawing under road infrastructure. The test site, 5 km southeast 
of Beaver Creek (Yukon) in a zone of discontinuous permafrost, was divided into twelve 50-m sections, 
including an undisturbed control section. Techniques being tested include: crushed-rock air convection 
embankments, heat drains, thermo-reflective air convection sheds, longitudinal air convection ducts, 
reflective aggregate surface treatments, grass-covered embankments, and plowing snow on side slopes 
(described in previous sections). 

Research is ongoing, but results from the first three years of monitoring suggest that some techniques have 
the potential to promote permafrost formation (or ground refreezing) and active-layer thinning, preserving 
the permafrost or reducing the rate of degradation (Malenfant-Lepage et al., 2012).

The three most promising techniques include longitudinal air convection ducts, thermo-reflective air 
convection sheds, and air convection embankments. These techniques utilize the “chimney effect,” 
wherein cold air is allowed to sink into the embankment and warm up. Lighter and warmer air is then 
released upward, removing embankment heat and lowering ground temperature. The light-colored 
aggregate has also shown strong potential to reduce subsurface warming. All seven techniques yielded 
results superior to the “do-nothing” scenario.

Results also suggest that the flow of water in the soil is a key factor in the dynamics of heat transfer and 
permafrost degradation at the test site (De Grandpré et al., 2012). A drainage ditch was excavated in the 
fall of 2010 to lower the water table, decrease the water flow and reduce the amount of heat conveyed 
through the road embankment. Since then, the water level and flow have decreased significantly. Models 
are currently being developed to provide a better understanding of the heat transfer and extraction 
processes generated by these techniques.

One of the major conclusions of this work is that no technique can be efficiently implemented without 
a thorough assessment of the surrounding terrain at the appropriate scale. This includes information on 
the site’s ground composition (including ice distribution and volume); thermo-physical properties; history; 
specific processes driving or sustaining permafrost; and the drainage network’s sensitivity to change.

5.0 RAIL TRANSPORTATION

Rail plays a smaller role in the territories than in other Canadian regions, but does provide important 
services. Similar to road infrastructure, rail track is particularly vulnerable to the effects of permafrost 
degradation. Thawing may cause heaving, sinkholes, potholes and settlement issues for railways in 
northern Canada (IMG-Golder Corporation Environmental Consulting, 2012). Associated adaptations 
can either be active, removing heat from the embankment, or passive, reducing heat absorption 
(Ferrell and Lautala, 2010). Some engineering solutions for roads can also be applied to rail 
infrastructure, including embankment widening and the installation of thermosyphons, snow sheds, 
and insulation. The following methods may also be used: 

•  Ventiduct embankments refer to pipes placed alongside the traditional soil embankment, 

allowing air to pass through the embankment and drawing heat from the soil. In order to reduce 
heat absorption of the soil during the summer months, these pipes can be sealed (Ferrell and 
Lautala, 2010).

•  Stone embankments are used to create pore space within embankments and allow air to 

penetrate the structure and natural convection to remove heat from the subgrade (Ferrell and 
Lautala, 2010).

•  Snow/sun sheds reduce snow accumulation and solar radiation on the embankment. They can 

also reduce water infiltration and permit airflow, removing heat from embankment surfaces (Ferrell 
and Lautala, 2010).

Extreme weather can damage embankments and create washouts and soil/rock slides, which may 
result in rail line closures (IMG-Golder Corporation Environmental Consulting, 2012). The incorporation 
of higher-capacity culverts for embankments and bridges can mitigate the effects of seasonal 
drainage and extreme events (IMG-Golder Corporation Environmental Consulting, 2012). Some rail 
companies also have winter operating plans that include snow removal, sanding and salting, track 
and wheel inspections, temporary slow orders, and personnel training initiatives (Lemmen and Warren, 
2004). Although rail transport is limited in Canada’s North, greater rail infrastructure development may 
be feasible in the future (Yukon Government, 2013). For a more detailed assessment of impacts and 
adaptations related to Canada’s rail sector, refer to other regional chapters.

6.1 CLIMATE IMPACTS ON AIR TRANSPORTATION 

For communities in the North, many which are not connected via roads, disruptions to aviation can 
significantly impact mobility and restrict the supply of goods. For example, in 2014, when Canadian 
North grounded all of its flights to and from Iqaluit during a blizzard, passengers in Pangnirtung, 
Qikiqtarjuaq, Hall Beach, Igloolik, Cape Dorset, Pond Inlet, and Clyde River were affected (CBC 
News, 2014).

Climate stressors that have an impact on air transportation in the North include fog, freezing rain, 
heavy precipitation, high winds, and blowing snow. For example, extreme fog and condensation can 
delay flights and shut down airports, particularly in coastal communities (Klock et al., 2001). While data 
on fog and condensation is limited, firsthand accounts indicate that fog events have become more 
frequent in the territories, resulting in reduced visibility at airports (Deton’Cho-Stantec, 2013). With few 
communities possessing navigational systems, this makes approaches to airports more challenging. 
For example, as of 2013, eight airports in the Northwest Territories did not have the navigational 
systems in place to assist pilots in landing during their approach. Thus, under extreme fog conditions, 
these airports are forced to suspend operations. For example, the airport in Wekweeti, Northwest 
Territories, was shut down for a week in September 2011 due to dense fog (Deton’Cho-Stantec, 2013). 

Rain and freezing rain can also have an impact operations by decreasing traction on runways and 
taxiways, necessitating the use of de-icing products prior to take-off. Loss of friction and flooding of 
runways can also cause flight cancellations, as was the case in Inuvik in 2011 when ground personnel 
were unable to keep the runway clear (Deton’Cho-Stantec, 2013). In addition, similar to all-weather 
and winter roads, changing air temperatures can impact the structural integrity of permafrost under 
runways and taxiways. 

Gravel runways and taxiways also present unique challenges for aviation in northern Canada, as they 
can become significantly weaker following periods of heavy precipitation or spring thaw (Transport 
Canada, 2016). The weakening of these surfaces may limit or completely halt runway operations 
(Transport Canada, 2016). This exacerbates another capacity issue: many airstrips in northern Canada 
can only accommodate relatively small aircraft (Parliament of Canada, 2011).

Permafrost  degradation  can  damage  and  degrade  runways/taxiways  (Government  of 
Nunavut et al., 2011).
Increased snowfall may cause flooding in the thaw seasons, damaging permafrost under 
runways/taxiways (Deton’Cho-Stantec, 2013).

Blizzards, blowing snow, and winter storms can reduce visibility and delay flight operations 
(e.g., via the accumulation of snow on runways) (Hanesiak et al., 2009).
Increased rainfall can reduce traction on runways/taxiways (Best, et al., 2014). 

Intense  periods  of  freezing  rain  can  cause  delays  to  flights  and  could  cause  airplanes 
to  experience  issues  with  braking  and  sliding  off  airstrips  (IMG-Golder  Corporation 
Environmental Consulting, 2012). 
Increased  fog  episodes  may  require  additional  training  and  procedures  for  airport 
personnel in order to ensure safety (Deton’Cho-Stantec, 2013).

Intense periods of fog can delay flights until visibility improves (Deton’Cho-Stantec, 2013).

Rising air temperatures will continue to affect permafrost conditions, presenting a risk to the integrity of 
both gravel and paved runways. Increased precipitation may lead to reduced traction and visibility. 
These changes will increasingly affect the planning, design, and maintenance of airports in the North.  

Finally, weather extremes associated with increasing and varying wind speeds, are expected to affect 
airports. For example, high winds contribute to severe blizzards and snowstorms that limit visibility and 
have the potential to slow down airport operations. These issues are summarized in Table 4.

6.3 ADAPTATION PRACTICES

Methods to address permafrost degradation affecting paved runway and taxiway issues are similar 
to those for all-weather roads given the similarities between these types of infrastructure (see Case 
study 3). Generally, airports in the North are reacting to these changes in the absence of long-term 
strategic planning.

Airports that have gravel runways can correct for ground settlement resulting from permafrost thaw 
by adding material to the runway/taxiway. Gravel is easier to resurface/grind up and replace in 
comparison to pavement (Deton’Cho-Stantec, 2013). Gravel runways can also be reconstructed 
without having to transport heavy specialized equipment to the location. 

In cases of heavy precipitation, grooving on paved runways and taxiways can improve traction and 
drainage. This method has been applied at Norman Wells Airport in the Northwest Territories in order 
to increase drainage and improve surface friction (Deton’Cho-Stantec, 2013). The cost of grooving 
varies depending on the type of runway material (e.g., concrete or asphalt), the type and size of 
aggregate (e.g., limestone, gravel, etc.), the age and condition of the runway surface, the size of 
the project, and local factor costs (e.g., fuel costs, support equipment, mobilization costs) (Best et 
al., 2014). While runway grooving has been shown to enhance water drainage, improve friction, and 
reduce sanding requirements, this technique is relatively costly (Deton’Cho-Stantec, 2013). In the 
event that grooving and/or sanding are not sufficient to increase traction and improve drainage, 
heavy machinery has been employed to remove pooling water.

Airports have been increasingly applying sand to surfaces in order to counter the effects of standing 
water and freezing rain. Sand requirements have been growing – for instance, Norman Wells Airport 
increased its use of sand from 10 to 15 tonnes per year prior to 2000 to over 150 tonnes per year in 
2012 (Deton’Cho-Stantec, 2013).

Airports attempt to mitigate the impacts of high snowfall on permafrost (thermal insulation) by 
removing snow as quickly as possible. In order for airplanes to operate during periods of heavy 
snowfall, airport personnel continuously clear runways and taxiways to allow airplanes to take off and 
land safely. 

De-icing agents are used commonly at northern airports to address aircraft wing contamination 
(e.g., by ice, snow, or freezing rain) (Deton’Cho-Stantec, 2013). De-icing agents can also be used 
to clear contaminants from runways and taxiways. These products contain glycol, and it has been 
suggested that runoff from these compounds may result in warmer ground temperatures and other 
environmental impacts. There have been calls for the development of a glycol management strategy 
as the volume of glycol used at northern airports increases (Deton’Cho-Stantec, 2013).

CASE STUDY 3: INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS AT IQALUIT 
INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT

Iqaluit International Airport is extremely important to communities in Nunavut given the region’s lack of road 
access. When the airport was constructed in 1942, little was known about the underlying permafrost and its 
importance to the safety and viability of airport operations. However, many problems related to permafrost – 
including runway stability issues stemming from thaw settlement of ice-rich soils – have occurred at the airport 
over its lifespan. In tandem with the need for expansion and facility replacement, permafrost issues prompted 
the development of an improvement plan by public and private partners.

In  2013-2014,  the  Iqaluit  International  Airport  Improvement  Project  was  initiated;  by  then,  the  importance 
of  understanding  the  nature,  location  and  influence  of  permafrost  degradation  on  infrastructure  was  well-
understood. A number of research projects were undertaken, employing a variety of techniques – including 
ground-penetrating radar, permafrost core analysis, surficial mapping, and remote sensing – to generate site-
specific  knowledge  about  permafrost  properties  and  model  interactions  among  permafrost,  climate,  and 
airport infrastructure (both existing and proposed). A key finding of this work is that permafrost tends to be 
subject to greater warming under pavement than embankments (and other “naturalized” surfaces).  

The data collected has been used to inform infrastructure decision-making. Maps were produced to identify 
potentially-problematic  locations  for  existing  and  proposed  infrastructure  (e.g.,  thaw-sensitive  soils  and/
or difficult terrain for construction); a taxiway was relocated with an insulated barrier to reduce permafrost 
damage; the importance of removing thick snow cover in key areas was recognized; thermosyphons were 
installed  beneath  airport  buildings;  and  drainage  was  improved  to  reduce  the  infiltration  of  surface  water 
into permafrost. Overall, informed engineering and operational decisions have been made at the airport with 
respect to the integrity of the underlying permafrost.

7.0 MARINE TRANSPORTATION

7.1 CLIMATE IMPACTS ON MARINE TRANSPORTATION (INCLUDING LAKES AND RIVERS)

Climate factors affecting marine transportation in northern Canada include: changing patterns of sea 
ice; precipitation events; strong and variable winds; and changing water levels. 

As discussed in Section 4, recent decades have seen dramatic changes in the Arctic sea-ice regime 
(Bush et al., 2014; Dawson et al., 2014). While decreases in the extent and duration of sea ice present 
potential economic opportunities in terms of increased marine traffic and shipping-season length, 
several barriers remain for Arctic shipping expansion. For example, the high year-to-year variability 
of ice in the Canadian Arctic has significant impacts on marine insurance, investment, and ship 
construction standards (Ellis and Brigham, 2009). Few year-round commercial navigational vessels 
currently operate in the Canadian Arctic (with the exception of nuclear icebreakers) (Ellis and 
Brigham, 2009).

Sea ice changes are also associated with coastal erosion, navigation problems, and infrastructure 
damage. Changing distributions of multi-year ice have led to ice detaching and migrating into 
unexpected areas, creating obstacles and hazards for cargo vessels (Deton’Cho-Stantec, 2013). 
This has implications for search and rescue capacity, winter shipping, passenger safety, and coastal

aerial surveys to limit potential complications (National Snow and Ice Data Centre, 2016). 

Decreasing sea ice also creates larger expanses and longer durations of open water, which worsens 
the impacts of storm and wind events, disrupts shipping routes, and increases the difficulty of 
maneuvering through narrow channels (IMG-Golder Corporation Environmental Consulting, 2012). 
Changing ice conditions can also increase the vulnerability of northern communities: recent ice 
conditions in the Canadian Arctic have held up the annual resupply of fuel and goods in some 
communities in Nunavut, for example (CBC News, 2015a).

For port operations, storm surge and extreme rain events can lead to flash floods, disrupt shipping and 
present risks to human safety. For example, storm surges have flooded port facilities in Tuktoyaktuk, 
temporarily suspending operations (Deton’Cho-Stantec, 2013). Strong winds associated with storms 
can also cause navigational challenges, especially in narrow channels and dockings, due to ice 
jams, ice choke points (i.e. a point of congestion created by ice), and wave action (IMG-Golder 
Environmental Consulting, 2012).  

For river transportation, lower water levels have required the use of lighter barges or smaller loads 
to maintain safety standards, in some cases disrupting operations (Deton’Cho-Stantec, 2013). For 
example, low water levels in the Mackenzie River have delayed the shipment of goods to northern 
communities in recent years, leaving residents without access to necessary goods and materials until 
shipments could be secured through more costly alternatives (such as air or road transport) (CBC 
News, 2015b and 2015c). Permafrost degradation along river banks and sides of valleys has also 
caused slumping and route obstructions in some locations, forcing river transporters to adjust their 
routes (Deton’Cho-Stantec, 2013).

choke points (Mudge et al., 2011). The deepest 
route is presented in red, shallow in green, 
and the least-travelled in yellow. In addition, 
navigation choke points are shown in blue.

7.2 FUTURE RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES

The Northwest Passage is not expected to 
become a viable route in the near future due 
to “seasonality, ice conditions, a complex 
archipelago, draft restrictions, chokepoints, 
lack of adequate charts, insurance limitations, 
and other costs” (IMG-Golder Environmental 
Consulting, 2012) (see Case Studies 4 
and 5). Throughout the northern region, 
destination shipping is anticipated to increase 
to accommodate expanding resource 
development, growing communities, and 
increasing tourism. However, operational costs 
will remain high due to the presence of ice and 
associated expenses (Ellis and Brigham, 2009). 

Over the longer-term, climate projections 
forecast that by midcentury, changing sea 
ice conditions will enable new routes for ice-
strengthened ships over the North Pole and 
new routes through the Northwest Passage 
(Smith and Stephenson, 2013). If and when the 
Northwest Passage becomes a viable shipping 
route, services such as re-fueling stations, tugs, 
and emergency repair will need to be carefully 
considered. Figure 14 identifies various routes 
through the Northwest Passage.

CASE STUDY 4: HAS THE NORTHWEST PASSAGE BECOME 
VIABLE? 

On September 19, 2014, icebreaking bulk-carrier MV Nunavik made history by transporting 23,000 metric 
tons of nickel concentrate from Deception Bay, QC to Bayuquan, China through the Northwest Passage. 
Prior to this historic voyage, only one full cargo ship had ever transited the Northwest Passage, and none 
had ever done so unassisted. In recent years, traffic in the Northwest Passage has increased but has been 
dominated by adventure tourists and private yachts. Full commercial cargo transits have been extremely 
limited, despite the route being touted for its decreased distance, and potential for fuel and cost savings. 
The Nunavik transit took 27 days, about 15 days shorter than a passage through the Panama Canal. The 
DNV-GL Polar Class 4 vessel, powered by a slow-speed diesel engine capable of generating nearly 30,000 
horsepower, is one of the most capable ships globally to withstand ice-infested Arctic waters. The ship is 
equipped with a sophisticated ‘iceNav’ system with virtual marine radar to detect potential ice hazards 
and determine efficient and safe routes. 

This historic voyage, along with the first cargo trip made by the MV Orion in 2013, proves that the Northwest 
Passage has the potential to be a viable shipping route. However, the fact remains that only two cargo 
ships have made the fabled journey – and for good reason. The passage remains extremely risky to 
navigate, considering its highly unpredictable ice and weather conditions, poorly-charted waters, and a 
lack of vessels with sufficient structural and technical capabilities. It is unlikely that the Northwest Passage 
will become a major shipping route in the near-to-medium term (Mudge et al., 2011).

CASE STUDY 5: RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT IN THE BEAUFORT 
SEA REGION

Reduced sea-ice cover as a result of a changing climate has prompted the petroleum and shipping 
industries to view the western Arctic waters with new levels of interest. The Beaufort Sea Region (water north 
of Canada and Alaska) is estimated to contain 10 billion barrels of oil (Houseknecht et al., 2012), and oil 
and gas companies currently hold licenses for nearly $2 billion (CAD) worth of exploration work over the 
next 10 years (Ellis and Brigham, 2009).  

There remain several challenges associated with resource extraction in the Arctic, including a need to improve 
safety (i.e. greater search-and-rescue and disaster-response capacity) and supporting infrastructure, as well as 
issues associated with changing and difficult-to-predict ice conditions (IMG-Golder Corporation Environmental 
Consulting, 2012). There are also other issues relating to the increasing season and extent of open water, 
including more frequent dangerous fog conditions, as well as greater wind, wave, and erosion hazards. These 
issues are problematic for an area lacking complete hydrographic charts.

Coastal erosion is also affecting Tuktoyaktuk Island, which protect Tuk Harbour – the planned supply and 
support base for offshore activity. The island has been receding at a rate of approximately 2m/year. “If the 
island erodes away or is breached, there is the potential for greater negative effects such as erosion of the 
inner harbour coastline or damage to infrastructure during storm surges or normal wave action, especially 
with rising sea levels” (Mudge et al., 2011). Ironically, the climate changes that are opening the Beaufort 
Sea to exploration and shipping are also likely to make exploration challenging.

CHAPTER 3: NORTHERN TERRITORIES

55

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016While reduced sea ice may result in greater marine activity over the long term, marine infrastructure 
and operations will remain vulnerable to decreasing sea ice and changes in sea level throughout the 
21st century. Despite rising sea levels globally, most of northern Canada is projected to experience a 
decline in relative sea level due to glacial isostatic adjustment (introduced in Section 4). As a result, 
some areas of northern Canada could face navigation issues such as reduced under-keel depths, as 
well as difficulties accessing coastal infrastructure due to lower water levels (Mudge et al., 2011). Trip 
cancellations and lower load capacities as a result of unsafe vessel keel depths affect the delivery of 
critical supplies from regional distribution centres to rural communities (White et al., 2007).

Exceptions to this trend include Tuktoyaktuk and Sachs Harbour (in the Northwest Territories), which 
will experience sea-level rise (James et al., 2014). The risks associated with higher sea levels include 
greater coastal erosion, more intense wave action/sea spray, increased exposure of dock decks, 
and higher waves (affecting structures) (IMG-Golder Corporation Environmental Consulting, 2012). 
Issues associated with wave erosion and storm surge will increase in these areas as well, as a result of 
decreased sea-ice cover (creating larger stretches of open water) and sea level rise (Case study 5).

Increased coastal erosion will necessitate more frequent and costly maintenance and replacement 
of shoreline and coastal infrastructure (Couture et al. 2015). Examples of additional risks from sea 
level rise include increased wave height (resulting in structural impacts) and increased corrosion of 
infrastructure designed to withstand specific sea level conditions (Mudge et al., 2011). Conversely, 
increased under-keel depths in these regions may present opportunities for greater vessel capacity. 

In short, the opportunities associated with opening transportation routes also come with challenges 
related to safety (i.e. greater risks associated with wind, wave, and ice action) and environmental 
protection (i.e. greater shoreline erosion).

7.3 ADAPTATION PRACTICES

Adaptation approaches for marine transportation can be categorized into practices for vessels and 
navigation, and those for coastal infrastructure. 

7.3.1 ADAPTATIONS FOR VESSELS AND NAVIGATION

Commercial shipping in the Arctic over the near term will be mainly limited to seasonal passages 
using vessels suitable for ice conditions that are variable and unpredictable from year to year (White 
et al., 2007; James et al., 2014; IMG-Golder Corporation Environmental Consulting, 2012). To mitigate 
the risks posed by changing ice conditions, many companies have carried out winter-operation risk 
assessments and ship-specific winterization procedures (Patterson, 2012). In many cases, damage 
to vessels can be prevented by careful route planning and operational prudence (Deton’Cho-
Stantec, 2013). Vessels are often outfitted with additional navigation and communications equipment 
to monitor ice conditions; these include iceNav systems incorporating advanced marine radar, 
enhanced target detection radar, and satellite communication technologies for acquiring ice 
charts and electronic chart viewers (Patterson, 2012). Ships can also be retrofitted with ice-breaking 
equipment (Journeaux, Assoc., 2012). If sea ice has accumulated in a docking area, a tugboat or 
the ship can maneuver back and forth to break the ice (Journeaux, Assoc., 2012). However, the 
availability of tugs can be an issue. Risks to propellers and rudders in shallow waters (e.g., during 
community re-supply) can be mitigated by using larger and more durable cargo vessels, and 
offloading to smaller and lighter vessels along problematic stretches of coastline (a process known as 
“lightering”) (Deton’Cho-Stantec, 2013).

The Sea-ice Monitoring and Real-Time Information for Coastal Environments (SmartICE) system is an 
innovative example of an enabling technology that can be used to provide ships travelling through 
Arctic waters with accurate and timely information about ice conditions (Fournier and Caron-Vuotari, 
2013). Developed by the Nain Research Centre, SmartICE combines remote sensing and traditional 
Inuit knowledge to provide relevant and accessible information on sea-ice thickness, concentration, 

 
CHAPTER 3: NORTHERN TERRITORIES

56

industry), and other factors (NAIN Research Centre Kaujisapvinga, 2015).

Vessels travelling along rivers often need to reduce cargo loads to allow for travel through shallow 
coastal areas. In the future, reduced water levels may further affect the cargo capacity of low-
draft barges (Deton’Cho-Stantec, 2013). In this case, adjusting the loads of some barges may not be 
sufficient – route adjustment may be needed in order to traverse some areas. Along the Mackenzie 
River, barges have adjusted their routes and reduced speeds while travelling through difficult waters 
(Deton’Cho-Stantec, 2013).

Governments have an important role to play in supporting marine navigation. The following services 
have been identified as critical to safe marine transportation: the production of navigational charts; 
the deployment and maintenance of navigational aids; the provision of weather and ice information 
and ice-breaking services; and the surveillance and monitoring of marine traffic (Office of the Auditor 
General, 2014). In addition, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has developed a Polar 
Code, covering a full range of design, construction, equipment, operational, training, search and 
rescue and environmental protection matters applicable to ships operating in the waters surrounding 
the two poles (International Maritime Organization, 2016). 

7.3.2 ADAPTATIONS FOR MARINE FACILITIES

For marine infrastructure in the western Arctic vulnerable to storm surges and coastal erosion, practices 
to reduce risks may include mapping areas most likely to be affected and constructing defenses to 
limit damage. Coastlines can be protected via the construction of barriers composed of sandbags, 
sunken vessels, and rocks and gravel to reduce the impacts of erosive wave action (IMG-Golder 
Corporation Environmental Consulting, 2012). However, while sea defense structures help to protect 
the coast, changes in coastal sediment dynamics which may occur as a result of construction or a 
changing climate are important considerations. In some cases, it may be necessary to relocate shore-
based cargo resupply infrastructure (e.g., fuel manifolds and piping infrastructure) to prevent damage 
(Deton’Cho-Stantec, 2013). Studies of sea ice behavior can help determine appropriate dock locations 
and shipping lanes. Docks could then be outfitted with systems to minimize the development of sea ice. 
In the immediate future, piers and mooring structures may require repair and reconstruction as a result 
of sea-ice impacts (IMG-Golder Corporation Environmental Consulting, 2012). 

For facilities along rivers, several adaptation practices have been applied to date. Along the 
Mackenzie River, mooring points have been moved so that barges may offload in stable locations 
closer to shore where less erosion has taken place. Gravel ramps have also been re-established to 
replace eroded materials in some locations (Deton’Cho-Stantec, 2013).

In some cases, it may be necessary to dredge harbours should water levels decline. This has been 
done in several northern communities in the past, including Tuktoyaktuk and Hay River (on Great 
Slave Lake), to cope with shallow water conditions. However, dredging operations require substantial 
resources that can serve as barriers to many communities. For instance, the cost to dredge a deeper 
channel in Tuktoyaktuk to allow the passage of cargo vessels has been estimated in excess of $100 
million (Deton’Cho-Stantec, 2013). There may also be a greater need for transferring cargo between 
vessels of different sizes to allow passage in shallow harbours, and during high wind events. However, 
this process slows down ships transporting goods to further locations (Deton’Cho-Stantec, 2013).

There are a number of gaps in available information related to the determination of climate 
impacts on transportation in Canada’s northern region. These include reliable and relevant climate 
information; available training, guidance and tools; and technical information for infrastructure. 

Regarding climate information, territorial governments and others have expressed interest in 
developing regional climate change scenarios in order to improve understanding of future conditions 
(Environment Yukon, 2009). In a survey of mining and transportation practitioners in the Yukon, 
participants also identified the need for downscaled climate data – some expressed concern that 
the data they were using was not appropriate for their area. Projections related to climatic elements 
such as rain-on-snow events, snow and permafrost interactions, and relationships between snowmelt 
and rain are in particular demand (Northern Climate ExChange, 2014b). There are two notable 
challenges to obtaining these climate change scenarios for the territories: limited baseline data is 
available at the local level, and capacity in the northern territories is restricted by limited financial 
and human resources (Government of Nunavut et al., 2011). The limited number of weather stations in 
the North and short duration of climate records also present challenges to developing local climate 
change scenarios. Practitioners have also indicated they lack practical and user-friendly guidance 
tools for using climate data, as well as training for practitioners and decision-makers (Northern Climate 
ExChange, 2014b).

Further development of building standards, codes, and community planning information that 
takes into account projected changes in climate have also been identified as desirable.  These 
would need to consider existing technical guidance on factoring in future climate changes when 
building on permafrost (Auld et al., 2010), and expand upon the Standards Council of Canada’s 
Northern Infrastructure Standardization Initiative that has developed standards for: 1) thermosyphon 
foundations (CSA Group, 2014a); 2) moderating the effects of permafrost degradation on building 
foundations (CSA Group, 2014b); 3) managing changing snow-load risks for buildings in Canada’s 
North (CSA Group, 2014c); and 4) drainage-system planning, design and maintenance in northern 
communities (CSA Group, 2015). Relevant variables include ground ice content as well as 
experienced and projected ground temperatures and permafrost thicknesses. Such information could 
be used to develop maps identifying areas suitable for infrastructure development (Champalle et al., 
2013), and be used at regional and local scales to determine areas with low, moderate, or high levels 
of vulnerability (Calmels et al., 2015).

Improved channels for information-sharing among northern practitioners and residents is another 
important gap. Tools such as the Arctic Adaptation Exchange portal, developed during Canada’s 
Arctic Council Chairmanship, help facilitate the sharing of adaptation best-practices among 
circumpolar communities (Arctic Adaptation Exchange, 2014). 

For marine transportation, updating geospatial databases to account for the challenges and 
opportunities presented by a changing climate is important. This involves updating maps and 
navigational charts to reflect changes in ice coverage and traffic, as well as providing the marine 
community with information and charting strategies to deal with future climate uncertainty. Publicly 
available data on coastal erosion would be particularly beneficial (Champelle et al., 2013). For 
example, the Coastal Information System (maintained by the Geological Survey of Canada) provides 
qualitative coastal changes based on multiple years of video and aerial photography that can be 
used by communities experiencing coastal change (Couture et al., 2015). In addition, improved 
hydrological monitoring would allow better understanding of the impacts of climate change on runoff 
volumes, evaporation rates, and water levels, and would benefit community resupply operations in 
the Northwest Territories. Lastly, improved water level monitoring, including a water level-monitoring 
network and ice/debris advisory service, would benefit barge operators throughout the region 
(Deton’Cho-Stantec, 2013).

and hazards would support more appropriate infrastructure.5 As surface transportation becomes 
more costly and difficult to construct and maintain in warmer temperatures, new transportation 
technologies may also need to be considered for northern Canada. Air ships have been studied 
as an alternative to surface transporting for many goods (including food) to northern communities 
and resource extraction sites – prototypes with 10- and 70-tonne load carrying capacity are being 
developed, with testing underway for specific applications (including use in remote northern regions) 
(Canadian Shipper, 2013). However, timelines for the uptake of this technology remain uncertain. 
Finally, while information on adaptation techniques and practices for roads (both winter and all-
weather) in northern regions is readily available, further risk and adaptation research for other modes 
would be useful.

9.0 CONCLUSIONS

Given the degree of climate change observed and projected for Canada’s North, significant 
research has been undertaken to assess opportunities and challenges for transportation in the region. 
This chapter has documented some key findings emerging from this growing body of work. While 
existing research can help governments, communities, and practitioners prepare for future conditions, 
gaps remain to support the efficient and reliable movement of goods and people in the North, now 
and in future.

This chapter has described the vulnerabilities of northern transportation infrastructure and operations 
to the impacts of climate change. It has also identified adaptation actions (both existing and 
potential) to address these issues. Underlying themes include the implications of permafrost 
degradation for transportation infrastructure (including all-weather roads, winter roads, and runways/
taxiways); challenges to northern shipping resulting from greater sea-ice movement, storm surges and 
coastal erosion; and the difficulties of dealing with climate change given the region’s vast size and 
limited human and financial resources. 

As discussed throughout this chapter, numerous practices – including adaptive maintenance 
practices, technological investments, and construction techniques – have been implemented by 
both the public and private sectors to reduce the impacts of a changing climate on people and 
supply chains. Adaptive maintenance requires constant and consistent information-gathering (such 
as ensuring snow removal equipment is in place and monitoring weather conditions). Technological 
investments can range from relatively simple (e.g., pavement grooving to improve traction on 
runways/taxiways) to more significant investments (e.g., installing thermosyphons). Adaptive 
construction requires identifying the nature of the risk (e.g., thawing permafrost) and choosing the 
appropriate technique (i.e. reinforcing embankments with geotextiles). Regardless of the approach, 
it is clear that the transportation sector in Canada’s North will be faced with significant changes to 
operating conditions over both the short and long term, and that it has begun to adapt accordingly.

• 

Transportation systems in British Columbia have demonstrated vulnerability to extreme weather 
and changes in climate.  Impacts of particular concern include those associated with: 

 -

 -

 -

 -

Extreme precipitation, such as atmospheric river (Pineapple Express) events, affecting road 
and rail networks, marine transportation lanes, and airport facilities;

Sea level rise and storm surge, increasing the risks of flooding and damage to fixed coastal 
infrastructure, including Vancouver International Airport, Sandspit Airport on Haida Gwaii, and 
the Port of Vancouver;

High winds, affecting marine transportation lanes; and,

Visibility issues, affecting airport operations, particularly in the British Columbia interior.

• 

Land transportation routes within British Columbia often occupy restricted corridors through 
mountains and along coastlines. In these settings, flooding (associated with extreme precipitation 
or snowmelt) and slope failures have resulted in infrastructure failures to road and rail systems in 
the past. Events that have affected one of these modes have typically also affected the other. 

•  While previous efforts to reduce climate risks to transportation systems were often reactive, and 

based on historical information, there is indication that this is changing. Transportation entities 
are now inclined to become involved in broader future focused climate change studies and to 
incorporate these finding into their systems.

•  Climate change vulnerability assessments and revised and updated infrastructure design criteria 

can improve planning and adaptation efforts for British Columbia’s transportation infrastructure. 
The provincial government has conducted vulnerability assessments for highway systems and 
continues to monitor and assess sea level rise.  The British Columbia Ministry of Transportation and 
Infrastructure is one of the first jurisdictions to require infrastructure design work for the ministry to 
include climate change implications.   

•  Given the interconnectedness of transportation networks in British Columbia, there is opportunity to 

share research, risk analysis, and adaptation best practices across modes. 

1.0 INTRODUCTION

British Columbia is Canada’s third-largest and most westerly province, encompassing more than 95 
million hectares of land and freshwater (10% of Canada’s land surface) and 27,200 km of coastline 
(KnowBC, 2016). Its geography is rugged – vast, snow-covered mountain ranges stretch along the 
coast and through eastern and southern regions of the province, while the central interior and 
northeast are characterized by valleys and broad plains. Provincial transportation systems must 
contend with many shoreline inlets, tight corridors traversing mountain ranges with few major passes, 
and long distances between population centres. Economic activity and opportunity is distributed 
across the province, as are populations and transportation networks.

As part of the Pacific Rim, British Columbia’s transportation network provides a key link between 
North America and Asia and facilitates the movement of people and goods to support provincial, 
national, and international trade. In this context, British Columbia requires aviation, marine, road, 
and rail infrastructure that is resilient, effective, and efficient. While infrastructure in British Columbia is 
designed to withstand certain types of weather and climate conditions, building and maintaining a 
viable transportation system in the context of projected changes in climate – including temperature, 
precipitation, patterns of extreme weather, and other variables – is essential. Transportation systems 

 
CHAPTER 4: BRITISH COLUMBIA

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016in the province demonstrate vulnerability to both extreme weather events and incremental changes 
in climate conditions. While difficulties persist in identifying the location and criticality of infrastructure 
vulnerabilities and communicating them to decision-makers, progress is evident in advancing climate 
adaptation broadly. 

This chapter examines the interactions and vulnerabilities of transportation infrastructure and operations 
to changes in weather and climate in British Columbia. It has a strong focus on engineering approaches 
to climate adaptation in the transportation sector.  The science and practice of adaptation is a relatively 
new undertaking in the engineering field, with the consideration of future climate conditions remaining a 
challenge and new way of thinking for engineering professionals (see Box). 

ADAPTING ENGINEERING PRACTICES TO CLIMATE CHANGE 

While engineers have long considered climate related parameters in engineering design work, this has usually 
meant looking back at historic trends. Given the current rate of climate change, this is no longer a reliable 
approach.  Provincial Professional Engineering Associations are responding by adding new professional 
requirements to ensure that potential climate change impacts are taken into account in the design process 
for the service life expected of the infrastructure.  This is a cultural change for agencies responsible for 
infrastructure, consultants carrying out engineering design work and clients commissioning the work. It is 
expected that future engineering work related to new infrastructure design and rehabilitation will reflect such 
action and progress. 

Due to the newness of this field and current limitations of climate models in providing information to engineering 
designers, many questions cannot yet be answered. For example, a particular climate parameter like extreme 
wind will have a significant effect on the future functionality and safety of a bridge being designed today.  
Anticipating how this parameter may behave 75 years from now is a level of uncertainty most engineering 
designers have not had to deal with before. 

It will take time for engineers to develop procedures and processes to adequately deal with climate change, 
and maximize the likelihood that infrastructure being constructed today remains safe and effective for public 
use for the whole of its design life.

1.1 POPULATION

As of October 2014, British Columbia had a population of 4.7 million (Government of British Columbia, 
2015a). The population is growing and becoming more urban, with the greatest growth in Greater 
Vancouver (Government of British Columbia, 2015b). In 1981, 22% of British Columbia’s population 
resided in rural areas and by 2011 this had declined to 14% (Statistics Canada, 2011). While the total 
number of rural residents remained relatively constant over that period, at around 600,000, urban 
population grew from 2.1 million to 3.8 million.

Most of the province’s population is concentrated in southern coastal areas (Figure 1). The Capital City 
of Victoria on southern Vancouver Island has a population of 327,000, while Greater Vancouver on the 
southern mainland of the province has a population of 2.4 million and comprises almost 60% of the 
province’s population (Government of British Columbia, 2015b).

coast, while mountainous and northern areas are very sparsely populated. (Source: Statistics Canada)

1.2 ECONOMY 

In 2013, British Columbia had a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of $215 billion, which represents about 
13% of Canada’s GDP (Statistics Canada, 2011). Historically, British Columbia’s economic activity 
was based around natural resources including forestry, mining and fishing. While these sectors are still 
important, the service sector has grown in importance, now accounting for four out of five jobs. Key 
service sectors include: finance, insurance, real estate, transportation, retail and wholesale trade, 
tourism, education, and manufacturing.

British Columbia’s economy depends heavily on trade, including international and interprovincial imports 
and exports (Table 1). Trade within the Asian Pacific region has increased significantly since 2001. With the 
growth of China as a global manufacturing centre, demand for British Columbia’s natural resources has 
increased. In 2011 British Columbia exported more to the Pacific Rim than to the United States. 

Increased demand from China and India have challenged British Columbia’s transportation 
infrastructure to meet these emerging opportunities. This infrastructure has played a key role in 
international trade due to its strategic location. For example, Prince Rupert, Canada’s closest port to 
the Asia Pacific Rim, saves up to 68 hours of shipping time compared to locations to the south, such as 
Long Beach in Los Angeles (Port of Prince Rupert, 2014).

British Columbia’s unique landscape strongly influences the province’s transportation systems  
(Figure 2). Ground transportation routes generally follow river routes and mountain passes, rather  
than the straight-line alignments typical of many other areas of Canada.   Thus, routes can be 
circuitous and often involve significant changes in elevation. 

British Columbia includes ten ecoprovinces, defined as part of a provincial ecoregion classification 
system (Figure 3). Ecoprovinces are areas with consistent climate processes, oceanography, relief 
and regional landforms. Each has a unique climate and they exhibit different sensitivities to projected 
climate changes.  The ecoprovinces generally align with the physiographic features of the province, 
as do the major transportation corridors.  With this understanding, it is possible to evaluate how 
climate change trends in British Columbia may affect transportation systems based on generalized 
climate change projections for relevant ecoprovinces within the province.

Columbia. (Source: Encyclopedia of British

British Columbia’s diverse landscape, including major mountain ranges, and proximity to the Pacific 
Ocean, strongly influence climate regimes in different parts of the province (Pacific Climate Impacts 
Consortium, 2013a). An important aspect of British Columbia’s climate is a phenomenon known as 
“atmospheric rivers” that are associated with very heavy precipitation, and have had significant 
impacts on transportation systems. Atmospheric rivers are long narrow streams of high water vapour 
concentrations in the atmosphere that move moisture from tropical regions towards the poles across 
the mid latitudes.  Pineapple Express is a term used to characterize an atmospheric river with origins 
in the western Pacific, east of Hawaii, flowing to and affecting the West Coast of North America 
between British Columbia and California (Figure 4). Atmospheric rivers are typically several hundred 
kilometers wide and thousands of kilometers long, and contain between 3 cm and 6 cm of water 
vapour in the middle of the stream (Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium, 2013a).  

Atmospheric rivers occur most frequently in the fall and winter in British Columbia. Their impacts are 
greatest on coastal areas when the moist water vapor laden air rises over the Coast Mountains, resulting 
in intense precipitation. The impacts have been significant, for example, the January 2009 extreme 
event shown in Figure 4 lasted two days and cost nearly $16 million, while another two-day event in 
June 2011 resulted in flooding and cost more than $85 million. In 2012, 15 registered flooding events 
affected over 100 communities in British Columbia (Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium, 2013a).

The Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium has done extensive work characterizing the current climate, 
identifying trends, and projecting future climate conditions for many regions in British Columbia.  These 
reports provide an analysis of trends across the province for the period 1901 through 2009 (Table 2). 
Over this period, British Columbia has experienced shifts in both temperature and precipitation.  These 
trends have accelerated since the 1950s. Overall, temperature across the province has increased 
by 0.18 °C per decade since 1951, an overall increase of 1°C. At the same time, the province has 
experienced generally wetter spring, summer, and autumn periods and significantly drier winters.

Relative sea level (relative to land height), has also been changing in British Columbia, with significant 
variability across coastal areas.  For example, during the past 50 years, sea level rose by 3.1 cm 
at Victoria and 2.0 cm at Vancouver, but decreased by 8.4 cm at Tofino (Vadeboncoeur, 2016). A 
number of factors contribute to changes in ocean levels, including atmospheric and oceanographic 
effects, such as storm surges and climate-variability cycles (e.g., Pacific decadal oscillation) 
(Vadeboncoeur, 2016). One of the dominant factors affecting relative sea-level change in British 
Columbia is vertical land motion, which can be attributed to a combination of tectonic activity 
(interactions of the Juan de Fuca and Pacific oceanic plates with the North American plate), glacial 
isostatic adjustment (the ongoing movement of land that was once covered by glaciers from the 
last ice age), and changes in ice-mass in the Coast Mountains and Gulf of Alaska (Vadeboncoeur, 
2016). Other factors that contribute to regional variability in sea levels include the influence of melting 
glaciers on nearby ocean waters and ocean surface topography alterations due to changes to 
ocean currents (Vadeboncoeur, 2016).

In addition to posing a long-term threat of coastal flooding, sea-level rise increases the risk of storm-
surge flooding.  Deeper water increases the height and energy of waves.  Extreme high water levels, 
which typically occur as storm surges are superimposed on high tides, can be particularly destructive 
to coastal infrastructure.

The Plan2Adapt tool (Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium, 2013c), developed by the Pacific 
Climate Impacts Consortium, provides generalized climate change projections for British 
Columbia for three time horizons as well as for each of the ecoprovince designations based on 
a standard set of climate model projections (Tables 3 and 4).  Projections are broadly consistent 
with observed climate trends (see Section 2.1). Overall, the climate in British Columbia will shift 
over the next 80 years with upwards of 2.7 °C of annual warming, wetter winters, generally drier 
summers and significantly longer frost-free periods.  

Table 3: Projected changes in selected climate variables for the province of British Columbia for three 
time periods – the 2020s, 2050s and 2080s. Projected changes are relative to the historic baseline 
1961-1990. The ensemble median is a mid-point value, chosen from a set of 15 Global Climate Model 
(GCM) projections for each of A2 and B1. (Source: Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium, 2013c)

Climate change is not only associated with warming conditions, but also more extreme weather 
events such as high intensity rainfall (Murdock and Sobie, 2013). The Pacific Climate Impacts 
Consortium preliminary analysis indicates that the frequency of Pineapple Express events will increase 
by 2041-2070 with the largest increases on the coast.  The average number of atmospheric river days 
per year is projected to approximately double at most locations, including the interior.

Projected changes in sea level in British Columbia (Figure 5) are similar to historic patterns (Section 
2.1).  The greatest amounts of sea level rise are projected to occur along the southern mainland and 
southeast Vancouver Island. The least amount of sea level rise is projected in areas where there is 
significant tectonic uplift, a non-climatic influence, described above in Section 2.1.  Projections vary 
according to emissions scenarios, and changes in relative sea level could be negligible at some sites 
under a low emissions scenario.

3.0 OVERVIEW OF BRITISH COLUMBIA’S TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM

The British Columbia transportation system encompasses a variety of different modes, including roads 
and highways, rail, marine, air, and urban transit systems.  The diverse hubs and networks related 
to these various modes act together to provide a cohesive transportation system that supports 
the people and economy of the Province of British Columbia, as illustrated in Figures 6 and 7. The 
alignment of the major transportation corridors and hubs along coastlines and within mountain passes 
and corridors is evident. 

This chapter focuses on roads, rail, marine and air, with urban transit systems discussed in Chapter 9.  
While this chapter discusses each transportation mode individually, it is important to understand that 
they are heavily integrated. Weather impacts that adversely affect one mode of transportation can 
also have negative impacts on other modes.

3.1 ROADS

British Columbia has over 46,000 km of roads, including provincial highways (12,700 km) and side roads 
(33, 300 km) (British Columbia Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure, 2014e; Figure 7), in addition 
to other municipal and federal roads. There are also over 2,800 bridges within the road system (British 
Columbia Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure, 2014e).

CHAPTER 4: BRITISH COLUMBIA 

77
77

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016In 2013, there were three million registered on-road vehicles in British Columbia, representing 13 
percent of the Canadian total on-road vehicle registrations that year. This includes 2.7 million light-
duty vehicles (automobiles, SUVs and lighter trucks), or approximately one vehicle for every 1.7 
people in the province (Statistics Canada, 2015b). The province’s population is, therefore, highly 
dependent upon the road system. Climate-induced interruptions in road service can have a 
significant impact on the lives and livelihood of the people of British Columbia.

3.2 RAIL

British Columbia has approximately 6,500 kilometers of railway (Figure 6), primarily served by Canadian 
National (CN) Rail (~4,400 km) and Canadian Pacific (CP) Rail (~1,720 km). Regional railways comprise 
another 402 km of track. This extensive infrastructure is designed to facilitate the efficient flow of 
goods through the Asia Pacific Gateway. The railways provide 24-hour, year-round service to port and 
terminal networks in Vancouver and Prince Rupert.  

CN’s main rail routes in British Columbia run from Vancouver to Edmonton, Alberta from Fort Nelson to 
Vancouver, and from Prince Rupert to Edmonton. CN Rail employs three Intermodal terminals in the 
province, located in Vancouver, Prince George, and Prince Rupert (CN, 2015). CN also operates an 
intermodal service from Prince Rupert, British Columbia to Whittier, Alaska. Called the AquaTrain, rail 
cars are loaded onto a barge directly and transported.  Alaska is completely dependent on CN Rail 
AquaTrain service for its freight transport, as this service is connected to all Alaskan Freight train routes 
(Alaskarails, 2015). CP’s main rail route runs from Vancouver to an Intermodal Terminal in Calgary, 
Alberta, and the company has one intermodal terminal in Vancouver (CP, 2015).  

In 2013, the British Columbia rail system moved 63 million tonnes of commodities, representing over 
20 percent of the Canadian total (Statistics Canada, 2015c). Of these, the principal commodities, by 
tonnage, were coal, lumber and wood products, sulphur, cement, automobiles, and wheat.  Many 
of the commodities reflect the resource-based nature of the British Columbia economy, and indicate 
the impact of trade with the Pacific Rim.

In addition to freight services, VIA Rail offers passenger services along two corridors, from Toronto, 
Ontario to Vancouver (The Canadian) (Via Rail, 2015a) and from Jasper, Alberta to Prince Rupert, 
British Columbia (Western Canada) (Via Rail, 2015b). 

3.3 AIR

There are 39 airports in British Columbia which are federally certified for passenger service, in addition 
to 251 registered land-based airports, aerodromes, heliports and water aerodromes (Transport 
Canada, 2015; Government of British Columbia, 2016a). Certified airports include Vancouver, the 
second busiest airport in Canada, Victoria the tenth busiest and Kelowna the eleventh busiest (Travel 
BC, 2016). (See Figure 6 for principle airports). Vancouver International Airport (YVR) handles over 19 
million passengers and more than 256, 900 tonnes of cargo in 2014 (Vancouver Port Authority, 2014). 
Airport expansion plans are expected to increase capacity.

British Columbia has three international ports, four regional ports, and 40 local ports (see Figure 6 for 
principle ports).  Port Metro Vancouver is Canada’s largest and busiest marine port, representing trade 
in excess of $187 billion annually with more than 160 countries (Port Metro Vancouver, 2014), and 
adding approximately $10.5 billion to the national economy (Government of British Columbia, 2011a). 
The three container ports in Vancouver, Prince Rupert and Nanaimo are interconnected with rail 
and road systems, as are major ports at Kitimat and Squamish. The ports of Stewart, Port Alberi, and 
Victoria have only road connections. Prince Rupert is the terminus of the Pacific Gateway Northern 
Corridor with capacity of 750,000 TEUs – container shipments are measured in 20-foot equivalent units, 
or TEUs, which represent one standard-sized shipping container (Government of British Columbia, 
2011b; World Bank Group, 2016)). Vancouver is the terminus of the Pacific Gateway Southern Corridor 
handling upwards of 2.9 million TEUs of container traffic annually (Port Metro Vancouver, 2015a).

In 2010, the province’s marine ports handled:

•  85 million tonnes of cargo traffic; and

•  2.86 million TEUs of container traffic (Government of British Columbia, 2011c).

Principal exports, by tonnage were coal, forest products, grain, potash, petroleum products, and 
metals, minerals, and chemicals.  Principal imports included: automobiles, household goods, 
construction materials, machinery, produce, base metals, and beverages. British Columbia’s marine 
ports also handle a significant volume of passenger traffic.  For example, in 2014 the Port of Vancouver 
handled 812,000 cruise ship passengers (Port Metro Vancouver, 2015b).

Ferries are another key element of the province’s marine transportation system.  7.7 million vehicles 
were transported by ferry through the province’s ferry system in 2014, representing 19.8 million 
passengers on 171,000 sailings (British Columbia Ferry Services Inc., 2015). BC Ferries, formerly a 
crown corporation and now a commercial organization, has 35 vessels and 47 ports of call providing 
passenger and cargo services to coastal locations in British Columbia. Ferry connections to the United 
States from British Columbia include the Alaska Marine Highway System, providing transport between 
Prince Rupert and South East Alaska.  In the South, vessels between British Columbia and Washington 
State provide service to coastal and island locations. Inland Ferries transport passengers and cargo 
across rivers and lakes on the mainland. Other vessels such as water taxis also provide transport to 
various locations.

The next section discusses historic climate impacts, future climate risks and adaptation practices as 
they relate to road, rail, air and marine transport in British Columbia.  Discussion of historic impacts 
includes several case studies of specific climate events.

4.1 HISTORIC CLIMATE IMPACTS

British Columbia highways have exhibited clear vulnerability to extreme rain events that have caused 
road washouts, mudslide blockages and bridge closures.  Heavy precipitation can cause flooding in 
rivers and creeks and may also trigger debris flows that can block roads, and clog culverts leading 
to road washouts.  Debris can also accumulate at bridge structures, potentially leading to bridge 
failures.  In some instances, these events can isolate communities from their principle lines of supply.

Three events, which all resulted in washouts of road infrastructure systems, are highlighted here to 
illustrate the climate sensitivities of British Columbia’s highway infrastructure.  The locations of these 
events have subsequently been the focus of detailed vulnerability assessments by the British Columbia 
Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure (see Section 4.2).

BELLA COOLA - SEPTEMBER 2010 

On September 25th and 26th, 2010 an intense frontal system stalled over the Central British Columbia 
coast, bringing heavy rainfall exceeding the 1-in-200 year rainfall of 200 mm (TranBC, 2016). The 
rainfall resulted in washouts and rock falls which, along with flooding, closed Highway 20 between 
Tatla Lake and Bella Coola (Figure 8). The route was impassable at 12 locations, as 12.5 kilometres 
of Highway were damaged, underwater or simply gone.  The impact of the road closure on local 
communities was made worse by other consequences of the storm as residents depended on diesel 
to generate electricity for heat, water and other vital services. Highway access to Tatla Lake and Bella 
Coola was not fully restored for 17 days and resulted in transportation repair costs of $45 million.

Fifteen sites along Highway 97 in the Pine Pass were damaged during a 1-in-100-year rainfall event 
on June 25th and 26th, 2011 (British Columbia Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure, 2014a).  
Damages included road washouts and flooding (overtopping) of bridges (Figure 9). The storm 
affected the entire Peace Region of British Columbia, with major floods and washouts damaging 
more than 280 sites on about 140 roads.  Road access, north of Prince George was closed, restricting 
tourist travel between British Columbia and Alaska. Transportation infrastructure repairs arising from this 
storm took through the summer of 2012 to complete and resulted in repair costs of $80 million.

In early September 2011, 333 mm of rain fell in the Stewart region of British Columbia, including 111 
mm of rainfall in a single 24-hour period (Fraser Basin Council, 2015). The event caused significant 
flooding and resulted in road washouts and bridge failures, including a failure of the bridge at Bitter 
Creek (Figure 10).  Washouts and the damage at this bridge closed 61.5 km of Highway 37A from 
Stewart to the Meziadin Junction with Highway 37. The bridge failure isolated the town of Stewart 
from the rest of British Columbia, stranding 117 tourists and vehicles.  Tourists needed to be air-lifted 
to Prince Rupert while vehicles were shipped out of the region by barge.  A temporary bridge was 
constructed by the British Columbia Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure, which was later 
replaced by a permanent structure. Transportation damages arising from this storm event resulted in 
$7 million in response costs and $11 million in repair costs that continued through the summer of 2012 
to complete.

The British Columbia Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure has completed five assessments using 
the Public Infrastructure Engineering Vulnerability Committee (PIEVC) Engineering Protocol (see Box) 
to determine vulnerability to road transportation infrastructure in British Columbia from future changes 
in climate, and identify potential adaptation measures (Table 5, Figure 11) (British Columbia Ministry 
of Transportation and Infrastructure, 2014b).  The assessments covered a broad range of geographic 
and climatic conditions.

Vulnerability Committee (PIEVC) 
Engineering Protocol, led by Engineers 
Canada, was developed as a 5-step 
process to analyze the engineering 
vulnerability of individual infrastructure 
systems based on current climate and 
future climate projections (see Figure 12). 
Since 2012, the PIEVC Protocol has been 
applied to a wide variety of infrastructure 
types, including roads and airports.

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Results of these two assessments identified a common vulnerability - the impact of extreme rainfall, 
such as high-intensity, short-duration (HISD) rainfall events, on highway drainage infrastructure 
(see Box). This risk was more pronounced on the Coquihalla Highway study location, where the 
increasing future intensity and frequency of atmospheric river events was identified as a very 
significant vulnerability.  A similar pattern of risk was identified for the Yellowhead Highway (British 
Columbia Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure, 2014c).   

As a result of these findings, and in consideration of recent extreme precipitation events in British 
Columbia that had damaged highway infrastructure, the remaining three highway assessments 
focused on extreme rainfall and other drainage challenging events.

CALCULATING EXTREME RAINFALL VALUES FOR INFRASTRUCTURE VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENTS

Extreme rainfall event design values are not always readily available for vulnerability 
assessments, especially for older infrastructure or through climate projection work. The values 
used for vulnerability assessments depend on the infrastructure system design, which in the 
past has relied on historical climate information for extreme events. They can vary significantly 
depending upon the location, topography, local and historical weather and climate conditions 
and the infrastructure involved.  For example, the Coquihalla Highway assessment identified an 
extreme rainfall intensity event as >76 mm of rain over a period of 24 hours, while the Yellowhead 
Highway and highways 20, 37A and 97 assessments used 24 hour rainfall values of >35 mm 
and >98 mm, respectively, to define extreme rainfall.  While the general projections outlined in 
Section 3 provide a starting point for this type of analysis, they are only the first step of a more 
focussed analysis necessary to answer questions about specific infrastructure systems.

Summary of Findings

All high level vulnerabilities identified for this highway segment were associated with HISD 
events.  HISD events also dominated the medium vulnerability outcomes.
80% of the higher vulnerability items were related to HISD events.  Other vulnerability factors 
identified included: 

Sensitivity to freeze/thaw impacts on winter maintenance; and 
Sensitivities to spring freshet impacts on culvert systems.

•  Bridge structure sensitivities to high temperature;
• 
• 
Higher vulnerabilities were associated with the impact of freshet conditions on protection 
works and bridge end fill.

Within the medium vulnerability category, 27% were related to HISD events.  The remainder 
were associated with freshet events.  These events are seen to challenge protection works, 
stabilization works and drainage elements in a very similar fashion to HISD events.
Same results as Bella Coola; 26% of vulnerabilities related to HISD events.
High vulnerabilities were associated with the impact of freshet conditions and HISD events on 
protection works and bridge end fill and third party utilities.  Of the high vulnerabilities, five were 
directly related to HISD events while the others were associated with freshet conditions.

Within the medium vulnerability category, 53% were related to HISD events.  The rest were 
associated with freshet events.  These events are seen to challenge protection works, 
stabilization works and drainage elements in a very similar fashion to HISD events.

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016All five highway segments examined also exhibited vulnerability to snowmelt driven peak flow events 
(freshet conditions). Such conditions generated risk profiles very similar to those associated with 
extreme precipitation – with generally increased risk of failure of drainage appliances, culverts and 
stabilization works (British Columbia Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure, 2014b). These and 
other potential vulnerabilities identified through the assessments are listed in Table 6).  

4.3 ADAPTATION PRACTICES 

As a result of its climate change vulnerability studies, the provincial Ministry of Transportation and 
Infrastructure now requires infrastructure design work for the Ministry to include climate change 
implications.  This includes a design criteria sheet where the designer indicates climate design 
baseline information, any additional climate change factors, and how the design will accommodate 
these climate changes over the infrastructure’s service life.  British Columbia is one of the first 
jurisdictions to require specific climate change adaptation measures to be included in infrastructure 
design work.  

The Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure also provides tools which can reduce safety risks 
to road users posed by extreme weather. Its DriveBC program aims to improve highway safety, by 
providing better real-time travel information for provincial highways on extreme weather conditions, 
road work, and closures. Since the program started in 2005, it has become the Ministry’s most popular 
online tool (British Columbia Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure, 2015).

5.0 RAIL TRANSPORT

Severe weather conditions that affect freight rail services in British Columbia can significantly affect 
the transportation of goods in Canada and potentially international trade. The rail industry in British 
Columbia has a long history of managing the effects of weather conditions on its operations. A review 
of Transportation Safety Board of Canada (TSB) reports reveals an ongoing and evolving pattern of rail 
incidents associated with climate events, in particular high precipitation events in British Columbia’s 
transportation corridors.  The British Columbia rail system has experienced incidents related to extreme 
precipitation, spring runoff and drainage.  These events can undermine railroad beds and are 
significant factors contributing to mud and rockslides that impact rail systems and equipment. 

Three weather-related incidents, associated with varying degrees of infrastructure damage, 
environmental impacts and injuries to railroad personnel, are highlighted here and could be used 
as a foundation to evaluate the potential for climate change to exacerbate conditions that have 
historically led to interruptions in rail services.   All three incidents arose from precipitation and 
drainage issues.

CONRAD – MARCH 1997

On March 26, 1997, a Canadian National (CN) train encountered a large roadbed depression near 
Conrad, British Columbia and derailed.  The CN locomotive engineer and conductor were fatally 
injured, fourteen freight cars and two locomotives were damaged beyond repair and 1,200 feet 
of track and siding was destroyed (Figure 13). Leaking fuel ignited and resulted in a fire that made 
firefighting difficult and required helicopter water-bombing to contain.  

Figure 13: Conrad, British Columbia train  
derailment. Collapse of the railroad subgrade 
was caused by extreme precipitation.  
(Source: Transportation Safety Board of Canada)

The investigation report for this incident 
provides extensive detail about the preceding 
weather conditions that led to this derailment 
(Transportation Safety Board of Canada, 1998). 
The key points from this analysis indicate that 
the period between October 1996 and March 
1997 was the wettest six-month period in 59 
years. March 26, 1997 was the 41st day of runoff 
from melting snow in the region.  However, 
the rate of melting snow suddenly increased 
between March 17 and 19 when a rain on snow 
event occurred.  The report concluded that the 
depression was caused by:

1.  High seasonal runoff that was not managed 

by drainage systems above the adjacent 
Trans-Canada Highway; and 

2.  Water saturating the ground through the 

highway fills, infiltrating and destabilizing the 
railroad subgrade, which then collapsed.

caused by debris flow onto train tracks. (Source: 
Transportation Safety Board of Canada)

KOMO – NOVEMBER 2009

On November 17, 2009, a Canadian Pacific (CP) 
freight train travelling west between Boston Bar 
and Vancouver struck a debris slide consisting 
of rock, mud and trees.  The locomotive and 
three cars loaded with copper concentrate 
derailed (Figure 14). The locomotive engineer 
and conductor sustained non-life-threatening 
injuries. At the time of the incident, the area was 
experiencing very heavy rainfall, caused by an 
atmospheric river event.  

The slide occurred during a period of heavy 
rain (Transportation Safety Board of Canada, 
2010). Large volumes of water transited through 
a highway culvert located above the affected 
track.  While the culvert had sufficient capacity 
to handle the water volume, diversion features 
downstream of the culvert were overtopped 
and significant volumes of water established an 
alternate channel that impacted the train tracks 
at a location where there were no culverts.  The 
diversion resulted in rock, debris and mud being 
carried downslope and onto the track below.

FERNIE – MARCH 2011

On March 8, 2011, twenty-seven rail cars loaded with coal derailed near Fernie, British Columbia.  
There were no injuries.  

Figure 15: Fernie, British Columbia rail track 
showing ice build-up. (Source: Transportation 
Safety Board of Canada) 

The TSB attributed the failure to rail rollover, resulting 
in excessive wide gauge (Transportation Safety 
Board of Canada, 2012). The rail gauge canted 
outward as a result of ice build-up between the 
base of the rail and the tie plates (Figure 15). The 
area had experienced numerous freeze-thaw 
cycles over the previous four weeks, which drew 
snowmelt water to the base of the rail through the 
pumping action of passing trains.  The TSB report 
also notes that between February 11 and 20, the 
ambient temperature was above 0°C during the 
day and below freezing at night.  There were 
23 millimetres of rain, between February 11 and 
14, followed by snow accumulation of about 58 
centimetres between February 15 and 17.  After 
February 17, through the end of the month, the 
temperature was below freezing and as low as 
-32°C. While this incident was attributed to freeze-
thaw, the root cause was high levels of snow, 
contributing to snow-melt accumulation at the 
base of the tracks.  This, combined with cycling 
between temperatures above and below the 
freezing point, contributed to the failure.

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 20165.2 FUTURE CLIMATE RISKS

As rail corridors in British Columbia tightly parallel highway routing, with transportation corridors sharing 
mountain passes and routing along rivers, it is not uncommon for drainage failure events on one 
system to also negatively affect the other.  In several of the case studies considered previously, failures 
on road system components resulted in mudslides onto the rail system. Therefore, severe weather 
events that negatively affect one system may have simultaneous impacts on others.  

Climate change work by British Columbia’s Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure indicates 
that in these same corridors, highways will continue to be affected by intense precipitation events 
leading to drainage component failure and slope instability, and that these events are anticipated 
to increase both in frequency and intensity into the future.  Given the close proximity between road 
and rail in British Columbia and the history of sequential and coincident failure of these systems, it is 
reasonable to project similar patterns of vulnerability for the rail system.

5.3 ADAPTATION PRACTICES

While specific references to rail companies conducting climate change assessment and adaptation 
work in British Columbia were not identified in the literature, it was observed that rail companies in 
British Columbia are making considerable effort to address the impacts of severe climate events, 
including extreme precipitation. The recommendations that arise from these investigations and 
follow up activities are very similar to those that may arise from focussed climate change assessment 
analyses. The forensic analysis conducted as part of the TSB investigation process is a critical input to 
climate change adaptation assessment, such as the work conducted by the British Columbia Ministry 
of Transportation Infrastructure for the province’s highway system.   Examples of these actions are 
listed in Table 9.

conducting activities to reduce climate risks (see Box). The TSB and rail companies extrapolate from 
forensic analyses of climate related failure events to establish generalized actions and approaches to 
mitigate the risk of such events throughout the rail system in general.

CANADA, PERSONAL COMMUNICATION, 2015)

Railway capital investments address a variety of issues and challenges, including how extreme 
weather events such as flash flooding, avalanches, washouts, and freezing, can lead to service 
disruptions within and around the railway network.  To ensure the efficient movement of traffic, 
railways invest significantly in track infrastructure upgrades, execute seasonal readiness plans, 
test natural hazard warning systems, undertake regular rail inspections, and ensure processes 
are in place to mitigate against, and to recover from, severe weather situations. A variety of 
technologies are applied to determine the status of rail infrastructure and the landscape it 
traverses, including:

•  Radar interferometer to measure track stability,

•  Vulnerability assessment of risk area and GIS mapping,

•  Landslide mapping; temporal and spatial,

•  Geotechnical assessment of slopes,

•  Laser movement detection system,

•  Fiber optic detection for slope movement,

•  River hydraulic studies; and,

•  Beaver dam assessment and management.

For planning and operations, the rail sector generally uses short-term weather forecasts/
considerations, rather than long-term climate projections.  Rail companies are concerned about 
climate change in terms of the potential for more frequent and/or intense severe weather 
phenomena, as these may cause catastrophic risk to the railway network and its operations. 
The Railway Association of Canada and the American Association of Railroads have both 
established Environment Committees that include extreme and inclement weather events within 
their mandates.

As with other transportation modes, the rail sector requires a scientific and fact-based approach 
to help them identify where climate change impacts are expected to occur in the short, 
medium and long term.  With this knowledge, adaptation efforts within the sector can be 
targeted, and ultimately more strategic.

6.0 AIR TRANSPORT

Climate affects air transportation systems in many ways, including: 1) accidents where weather 
conditions have contributed to the causes; 2) service interruptions that have been caused by 
weather; and, 3) impacts on physical infrastructure systems.

WEATHER-RELATED ACCIDENTS

The air industry has a long history of managing and coping with weather conditions and has 
established standard procedures for accessing weather forecast information and incorporating that 
information into flight planning (Klock and Mullock, 2001). Impacts of severe weather are normally 
managed through avoidance practices, resulting in flight delays and through advancements in 
technology that incorporate advanced aircraft instrumentation systems. The result is a very low 
frequency of weather-related accidents.

In British Columbia, only seven aircraft incidents with weather related contributing factors over the last 
thirteen years have been of sufficient magnitude to warrant TSB investigation (Table 10).

The TSB reports demonstrate that, historically, weather is rarely the sole cause of aircraft incidents.  
Rather, it is weather conditions and pilot error combined which led to an incident.  Furthermore, 
the relative scarcity of weather-related aircraft incidents indicates that the air sector has effective, 
ongoing management strategies and technological development to accommodate severe weather 
conditions, and will not fly when conditions are unsafe.

Weather-related delays and cancellations in air transportation services can be very disruptive to 
individuals and the Canadian economy, as they can have ripple effects across the national airport 
system. Causes include thunderstorms, fog, snow, and icing.  In mountainous regions of the British 
Columbia interior weather-related fog and visibility issues can be problematic.  Varying topography 
can result in very different weather conditions in close proximity.  For example, the West Kootenay 
Regional Airport in Castlegar experiences frequent flight delays due to low ceilings and the 
surrounding mountains while the Trail Regional Airport, roughly 40 km south of Castlegar, offers better 
weather conditions and greater reliability in scheduled flights.  Navigation technologies can play 
an important role in reducing weather-related delays. For example, the Northwest Regional Airport 
in Terrace, in the Coastal Mountains, often experiences weather conditions very similar to the West 
Kootenay Regional Airport, but has far fewer weather related cancellations. This can be attributed 
to Instrument Landing Systems (ILS) employed at the Terrace Airport that are not installed at West 
Kootenay. These systems can cost well in excess of $1 million to install, and are often considered 
uneconomic for smaller airports. 

Changes in parameters affecting airport operations, and that can result in flight delays and 
cancellations, include extreme weather, storm surge and sea level rise over time. Fortunately airports 
in British Columbia can handle most snowstorm events, with the occasional service delay.  Having 
appropriate snow removal equipment and staff can help to manage this type of event.  

Visibility issues are more problematic. While Vancouver International Airport has an advanced ILS 
(enabling landing and departures in visibility conditions as low as 600 feet), not every airport in 
British Columbia is equipped with ILS. While other management options such as Required Navigation 
Performance may be available, they often require ongoing cooperation between regional airports 
and air carriers. The main approach to visibility issues is flight cancellation or diversion to alternative 
airports.  This can inconvenience passengers, and over the long-term, potentially compromising 
regional growth. 

IMPACTS ON PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS

Coastal airports may be exposed to the hazards of storm surge and sea level rise (see Box). For 
example, the low elevation of Vancouver International Airport’s physical infrastructure could 
potentially be affected by storm surge and sea level rises over time.  This airport is a major regional, 
national, and international hub, and disruption of service could have wide-ranging impacts on 
air mode reliability in British Columbia and elsewhere.  The airport is located on Sea Island, close 
to sea level, and is also in the Fraser River floodplain where there is flooding potential from heavy 
precipitation affecting river flow, plus Pacific Ocean storm surge and changing conditions from 
sea level rise.  A dyke system, approximately 15 km long, currently protects Sea Island.  The Airport 
Authority has an ongoing program to manage the dykes and regularly assesses flood risk, while 
working in collaboration with federal, provincial, and local governments to define appropriate dyke 
elevations (Marion Town, Vancouver Airport Authority, personal communication, 2015). Other relevant 
measures at Vancouver Airport include ensuring the airport has an in-to-wind runway in virtually all 
wind conditions; and investments in pavement snow and ice control and de-icing, to ensure aircraft 
can safety operate in severe weather conditions.

2011. The end of the runway was subject to 
severe wave overtopping during a 
significant storm event, with a sea surge 
approximately 1 metre above runway 
elevation.  A 250 m section of damaged 
riprap needed to be re-constructed. 

SANDSPIT AIRPORT

Transportation infrastructure and operations 
at Sandspit Airport, Haida Gwaii, are 
susceptible to winter storms and associated 
storm surges with potential increases and 
attendant issues as sea levels rise over time.  
The runway is located across the ‘spit’ and 
heavy and frequent winter storms have 
caused severe wave damage to riprap 
revetment, which is a sloping structure made 
of rocks or other material, protecting the 
shore. Overtopping of the revetment has 
become more frequent in recent years, with 
damage and repairs occurring on an annual 
basis, including marine debris and driftwood 
on the runway and damage to airfield lights 
and pavement (Figure 16). The airport is also 
located within the Pacific Flyway, a route 
for migratory birds. Airport operators have 
observed changes over the last decade in 
migratory and resident birds that also affect 
management of the airport.  

In light of these changes, the airport needs 
to continuously adapt its operations to 
ensure continued safety. The vulnerability of 
Sandspit Airport may need to be further assessed, along with new management approaches 
and practices, as the frequency and magnitude of storm surge events will increase as a result of 
sea level rise.

Written with input from Transport Canada staff, Pacific Region Office.

6.2 FUTURE CLIMATE RISKS

While visibility is an ongoing concern for British Columbia airports, it is presently unclear how climate 
change will affect the situation. The vulnerability assessments of highways by the British Columbia 
Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure noted that current climate models cannot project 
changes in visibility conditions in the complex landscape of the British Columbia Interior Mountains. 
This issue has been identified by the Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium as a topic for further work, 
specifically to address transportation risks in the British Columbia interior.

Warmer and wetter winters in future might suggest a decline in snow-related air travel delays: 
however, projections of changes in the frequency and intensity of snowfall events over a shorter 
winter season remain uncertain. This represents another area where additional modeling work to 
assess the nature, form, frequency and intensity of future snowfall events for major British Columbia 
airports would be valuable.

Sea-level rise, and associated increases in storm-surge flooding, is a threat to operations at both 
Vancouver International Airport and Sandspit Airport (plus river flooding at Vancouver International 
Airport).  As part of the Vancouver International Airport Authority’s work to support the Airport 
Master Plan 2057, the Airport Authority is assessing climate change impacts on airport operations. 
The objective of this work will be to review and gain a better understanding of anticipated climate 

 
CHAPTER 4: BRITISH COLUMBIA 

95
95

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016change impacts specific to Sea Island. Further work is expected to include the identification and 
quantification of possible risks associated with climate change impacts to airport operations. The 
results of these studies will culminate in adaptation plans from which any infrastructure improvements 
would be incorporated and funded through the Airport Authority’s capital program.

6.3 ADAPTATION PRACTICES

The air sector manages weather conditions on an ongoing basis, adjusting practices as changes in 
weather phenomena are observed.  In this sense, for many airports (with exceptions, such as Vancouver 
International Airport), adaptation tends to be primarily reactive, rather than performed in anticipation of 
future changes.  At the same time, aircraft technology is evolving with more frequent use of instrument 
landing systems and other innovations allowing aircraft to fly safely in less than ideal conditions.

While there is very little information available regarding climate change risk assessment studies for air 
transportation in British Columbia, this does not mean that these studies are not being undertaken, 
as they may not be published or available in the public domain. For example, there has been a 
commitment to undertake a climate change risk assessment for the Vancouver International Airport that 
addresses risks of sea level rise and implications for the ongoing review and renewal of dike systems. 

7.0 MARINE TRANSPORT

As a coastal province, and a major national hub for both passengers and goods, weather events that 
affect British Columbia marine transportation systems can have significant provincial and national 
impacts.  As with aviation, impacts of concern include:

•  Accidents where weather conditions have contributed to the causes; 

•  Service interruptions caused by weather; and, 

• 

Impacts on physical infrastructure systems.

7.1 HISTORICAL CLIMATE IMPACTS

The marine sector has a long history of managing and coping with weather conditions and has 
established standard procedures for accessing weather forecast information and incorporating that 
information into voyage planning.  As a result, impacts of severe weather are normally managed 
through avoidance practices (resulting in delays) and through improvements in technology that 
incorporate advanced weather monitoring and navigation systems.  For example, Environment and 
Climate Change Canada maintains an extensive network of weather forecasting areas, observation 
sites and marine weather radio frequencies for the British Columbia coastline (Government of Canada, 
2016). The system provides ongoing weather information to the marine sector and provides warnings of 
inclement weather that may affect marine transportation systems. This has resulted in weather-related 
marine accidents being relatively uncommon in British Columbia. A limited review of TSB reports suggests 
that any weather-related marine incidents involve strong components of human error.  

Seaports in British Columbia must be able to handle high winds and heavy rainfall, normally at the 
same time.  In 2014, four percent of British Columbia ferry sailings were delayed due to weather.  High 
winds are a common cause of delays, with heavy rain another factor (British Columbia Ferry Services 
Inc., 2016).  While the percentage is not large, it nonetheless represents 6,600 of the year’s sailings 
being disrupted by weather conditions. Severe weather can not only result in delayed or canceled 
sailings, but can also affect physical infrastructure systems. For example, on November 3, 2015, high 
winds pushed the Queen of Nanaimo (ferry service between Vancouver Island and the Mainland) out 

 
CHAPTER 4: BRITISH COLUMBIA

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016of position, causing it to crash into and damage a private floating dock (CBC News, 2013). However, 
to date damage to physical infrastructure systems arising from weather related events has been 
relatively rare.

7.2 FUTURE CLIMATE RISKS

While wind is a key parameter in climate change forecast work, predicting the nature and intensity 
of short duration wind events is technically difficult and models are not good at simulating surface 
winds (Engineers Canada, 2008; Griffin et al., 2010). Specific studies aimed at assessing the impact of 
changes in high wind intensity and frequency on marine sector operations have not been identified. 
Existing practices that utilize a sophisticated network of weather monitoring and forecasting facilities 
may be sufficient to address future risks. Nonetheless, a changing climate may result in an increase in 
cancellations and delays, with economic implications. This is an area for further study.

Preliminary analysis (see Section 2.2) indicates a likely increase in the frequency of atmospheric river 
events by 2041-2070, with the largest increases on the coast.  The average number of atmospheric 
river days per year is projected to approximately double at most locations, including the interior. 
Specific marine sector studies or activities to assess the impact of changing precipitation intensity and 
frequency on marine sector operations in British Columbia were not identified.

Studies are underway to examine flooding scenarios based on spring snow melt, coastal storm surge, 
king tides and sea level rise flooding for areas around the Fraser River, where a number of port facilities 
are located.  These studies are being developed under a Lower Mainland Flood Management 
Strategy that involves a number of entities including municipal and provincial governments, the 
Fraser Basin Council and others such as Port Metro Vancouver (Kerr Wood Leidal, 2015). As part of this 
Strategy, the Fraser Basin Council is proposing to examine the vulnerability of key infrastructure, such 
as ports, rail, airports, highways, emergency or major road networks, and BC Hydro substations, to 
flooding.

Previously, the province completed studies assessing the impact of flooding from sea level rise and 
climate change on the Fraser River (Fraser Basin Council, 2014), and also published guidelines for 
the management of coastal flood hazard land use and sea dykes (Ausen Sandwell, 2011). As well, 
the British Columbia Professional Engineers and Geoscientists have published professional practice 
guidelines for flood assessments in a changing climate (Association of Professional Engineers and 
Geoscientists of British Columbia, 2012). The Ministry of Forests, Lands and Natural Resource Operations 
provides coastal flood hazard maps that indicate the impact of sea level rise for the entire provincial 
coastline for the year 2100 (Government of British Columbia, 2016b). The maps clearly indicate that 
by 2100, the region around Port of Vancouver will be a high flood hazard area, presenting risks to port 
infrastructure facilities that may disrupt the flow of goods and services into and out of the southern 
Pacific Gateway Corridor.

7.3 ADAPTATION PRACTICES

The extensive network of weather monitoring stations and forecasting services for the marine sector 
in British Columbia represents a primary response to reducing climate risks.  The sector adjusts 
practices to accommodate inclement weather and may benefit from adjusting future practices 
to accommodate weather changes. The longer term risks to coastal infrastructure including ports, 
associated with sea-level rise are recognized by the provincial government. It has implemented a 
concrete plan of action that includes monitoring, and specific requirements for maintaining and 
upgrading sea dykes.

The Government of British Columbia has been working to better prepare the province to adapt 
to a changing climate. This includes a province-wide plan Preparing for Climate Change: British 
Columbia’s Adaptation Strategy, which aims to build a foundation of knowledge and tools, make 
adaptation a part of the Government’s decision-making, and assess risks and implement priority 
adaptation actions in key climate sensitive sectors (British Columbia Ministry of Environment, 2010). 

Of specific relevance to transportation, British Columbia Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure 
has developed a set of notional best practices based on the outcomes from their climate 
change vulnerability assessments of British Columbia highway systems (British Columbia Ministry of 
Transportation and Infrastructure, 2014e). These notional best practices are generally applicable to all 
transportation infrastructure systems, and are grouped into three primary categories: data, personnel; 
and, process (see Box).

This assessment has identified the following gaps in knowledge and information to advance 
adaptation decision-making related to transportation systems in British Columbia. 

•  Extreme Precipitation Events. Extreme precipitation events are the primary climate-related 

concern for road and rail transportation systems in British Columbia.  Work is ongoing to 
characterize the future nature, frequency and intensity of such events. This work could be 
expanded with a focus on ensuring that decision makers have sufficient information and tools 
to inform system design, operation and maintenance for future extreme weather and climate 
conditions.  Additionally, further work to characterize conditions that affect marine transportation 
and to project future precipitation event frequency and intensity would be useful.

•  Sea Level Rise Impacts on Coastal Infrastructure Systems.  Sea level rise and storm surge pose 
risks to coastal infrastructure in British Columbia, particularly to Vancouver International Airport, 
Sandspit Airport and Port Metro Vancouver.  The Province of British Columbia has an active 
program to assess these risks and provide guidance to decision makers regarding adapting to sea 
level rise. Risk assessments will continue to be a key tool in ensuring that the owners and operators 
of critical coastal infrastructure facilities in British Columbia have the appropriate information to 
build, adjust and maintain infrastructure that is adaptable to sea level rise. 

•  Marine Wind Events. High winds can lead to sailing cancellations and delays within the marine 
transportation system.  Climate change projections of high wind event frequency and intensity 
are not reliable.  More work in this area would provide decision makers with a better foundation to 
plan and implement operational changes to adapt to changes in high wind event frequency and 
intensity.

•  Visibility Issues in the Interior. Visibility can have significant impacts on road and airport operations 

in the British Columbia interior. While these issues are being managed, the causes of low visibility 
(fog) in the interior, and particularly the likely future changes in conditions that lead to these 
events, are not well understood.  More knowledge about these weather effects could aid decision 
makers in implementing new systems and procedures to adapt to anticipated changes.

Climate change adaptation in all transportation marine modes in British Columbia has generally 
been reactive, with issues being addressed only after impacts have been observed.  However, recent 
vulnerability assessments have examined longer-term climate change issues for some infrastructure.  
These studies of climate change and its effects on infrastructure will allow operators to better 
anticipate issues, and encourage the development of contingencies to adapt facilities, assets and 
operations to the risks posed by a changing climate.  Given the contribution of rail, air and marine 
sectors to the provincial and national economies, additional climate change vulnerability assessments 
in all modes could be beneficial.

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 201610.0 CONCLUSION

This chapter has demonstrated the vulnerability of British Columbia’s transportation system to extreme 
weather and the changing climate, described practices to reduce these risks, and identified potential 
areas for additional work.  The province’s transportation network is critical for the effective movement 
of people and goods through airports, ports, rail, and roads – both within the province and between 
North America and Asia. However, many of British Columbia’s transportation corridors, which traverse 
mountainous terrain and coastlines, are vulnerable to disruption and even failure resulting from 
climate events. 

This chapter also indicates that infrastructure operators in British Columbia are primarily responding 
to failures, rather than anticipating and preparing for change. As a result, infrastructure impacts 
could be more severe than if proactive adaptive measures had been taken.  Along with more 
robust data collection tools for climate and weather variables, and effective guidelines for data 
modeling and interpretation, proactive approaches (i.e. vulnerability assessments, infrastructure 
design requirements) could offer transportation decision-makers a stronger foundation for adaptive 
decisions. Sharing studies of climate vulnerability among operators and modes may improve learning 
and could benefit the transportation system as a whole.

The British Columbia Ministry of Transportation has assessed the vulnerability of several of the 
province’s highways to climate change, and is one of the first jurisdictions to require that road 
infrastructure design work for the ministry consider climate change implications.  This is an important 
indicator that adaptation efforts in British Columbia’s transportation sector are advancing, though 
more work remains to be done.

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016KEY FINDINGS:

•  Flooding associated with extreme precipitation events has been driving climate adaptation efforts 

for transportation in the Prairies, and increasing frequency and intensity of such events is a key 
future concern.  Flood-control strategies (e.g., expanded and enhanced culvert programs to 
reduce washouts, impermeable runway treatments) represent key adaptations for rail operations, 
airports (particularly in the northern Prairies), and roadways in the region to date.

• 

The high variability inherent in the climate of the Prairies means that adaptation in the 
transportation sector is likely to involve both reactive and proactive measures.  Given climate 
uncertainties and cost challenges in the transportation sector, decision-makers in the Prairies tend 
to view operational adaptations on a case-by-case basis. The importance of long-term planning 
for infrastructure (including zoning requirements), however, is illustrated by damage sustained in 
recent flood events in southern Alberta and Manitoba. 

•  Efforts are underway to address the vulnerability of winter roads to increasing temperatures in the 
Prairies.  While routing changes and technical adaptations have contributed to longer operating 
seasons in recent years, further projected warming may require more significant adaptations (i.e. 
the construction of all-weather roads).

• 

Thawing of permafrost in the Hudson Bay Lowlands will continue to challenge the operational 
viability of rail in the region. Since the track was laid in the 1930s, geotechnical engineers have 
made costly efforts to stabilize the rail bed.   Over the long term, thawing permafrost is likely 
to increase stabilization challenges, although disappearing permafrost could also improve the 
viability of some techniques. 

1.0 INTRODUCTION 

A changing climate and extreme weather present both challenges and opportunities for Canada’s 
Prairies, including the region’s extensive transportation infrastructure and operations. One objective 
of this chapter is to identify what is known about the nature of climate impacts (both positive 
and negative) occurring now and in the future in Canada’s three Prairie provinces – Manitoba, 
Saskatchewan, and Alberta. The chapter also aims to identify and describe efforts made by 
governments and transportation operators to adapt practices and improve infrastructure to enhance 
the resilience of the region’s transportation network.

While referred to as “the Prairies” for simplicity in this chapter, the three provinces are quite distinct. 
The following section reviews some of the key geographic and economic characteristics of Alberta, 
Saskatchewan and Manitoba. More specific regional context is provided, where appropriate, 
throughout the chapter. Subsequent sections focus on climate impacts and associated adaptation 
practices for each major mode of transportation – roads, rail, aviation, and marine based on 
available information and practitioner experiences.

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 20161.1 GEOGRAPHY AND THE PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT

The Prairie provinces collectively account for approximately 20 percent of Canada’s total surface 
area, including both land and water (Statistics Canada, 2005). The Prairies extend west from Hudson 
Bay to the crest of the Rocky Mountains, spanning several major watersheds and geographic areas 
(Sauchyn and Kulshreshtha, 2008).  This results in significant climatic diversity (Figure 1). 

The flat, dry plains of the south-central Prairie ecozone occupy 25 percent of the region’s land area, 
characterized by persistent and often severe moisture deficits. This ecozone is the region’s agricultural 
and industrial heartland, and one of Canada’s most extensively-modified — only remnants of the 
grasslands and less than half of the wetlands that existed prior to European settlement remain 
(Sauchyn and Kulshreshtha, 2008). This region gives way to the Boreal Plains in central Manitoba, 
central Saskatchewan, and most of central and northern Alberta, an area characterized by mixed 
and coniferous forests (Sauchyn and Kulshreshtha, 2008). The Boreal Shield lies north and east of the 
interior plains in northern Saskatchewan and northeastern Manitoba.

The four remaining ecozones are on the margins of the Prairies, accounting for small proportions of 
the region’s area and population. The Taiga Plains extend from the Mackenzie River valley of the 
Northwest Territories up the tributary valleys of northwestern Alberta, containing forests with limited 
productivity due to a cooler climate and shorter growing season (Sauchyn and Kulshreshtha, 2008). 
The Taiga Shield extends across Canada’s subarctic, including the northern reaches of Manitoba and 
Saskatchewan and northeastern Alberta. At opposite corners of the Prairies are the Hudson Plains 
in the Prairies’ northeast (containing the Hudson Bay Lowlands), which are dominated by extensive 
wetlands (Beaudoin et al., 1997), and the Montane Cordillera in southwestern Alberta. The Cordillera 
contains significant ecological diversity and landscapes of high relief, ranging from low-elevation 
fescue grassland through montane forest to subalpine forest and alpine tundra (Sauchyn and 
Kulshreshtha, 2008). Mountain snowpacks and glaciers of the Cordillera provide most of the southern 
Prairies’ river flow and water supply (Sauchyn and Kulshreshtha, 2008).

levels in the south, although the Rocky Mountains create localized variations in climate. Altitudes 
generally rise east to west. Churchill, Manitoba, is located at sea level on the shore of Hudson Bay and 
represents the Prairies’ only access to tidewater. Almost all road and rail infrastructure is concentrated 
in the Prairies ecozone, which also encompasses the region’s five largest cities.

East of the Rocky Mountains, there are few physical limitations to surface transportation in the Prairies. 
The mountains constitute an evident barrier, although corridors through the Rockies have existed 
for many years. One of the most significant is Crowsnest Pass, which acts as a conduit for rail and 
roadways between Alberta and British Columbia (Babaian, 1985). Other major mountain routes 
include the Yellowhead, Kicking Horse, Howse, Athabasca, and Vermillion Passes. The potential 
for bottlenecks in these high-elevation passes represents one of the main surface transportation 
challenges in the Prairies.

Muskeg – “a living vegetative mat [overlying] peat in the presence of a very high water table” 
(Lautala et al., 2008) – in the Hudson Bay Lowlands presents another transportation challenge. 
Permafrost contributes to the terrain’s low compressibility (Lautala et al., 2008). As a result, stable road 
and rail beds are difficult to maintain in these environments.

1.2 ECONOMY

The Prairies economic strength derives from natural resource extraction. From 2010 to 2011, the gross 
domestic product (GDP) of the three provinces collectively rose 11.1 percent to $429.5 billion, nearly 
doubling the national growth rate. By 2014, the region’s contribution to Canada’s GDP totaled 25.6 
percent. In 2014, Alberta contributed the largest share to the Prairies’ combined GDP, due primarily 
to its extensive oil and gas reserves and large population. In 2013, Alberta contributed 72 percent 
of regional GDP, followed by Saskatchewan (14.7 percent), and Manitoba (13 percent) (Statistics 
Canada, 2014a).

The Prairies’ share of GDP from transportation and warehousing remained stable from 2009 to 2013, 
ranging from 4.3 to 4.4 percent (Statistics Canada, 2014a). While the North American Industrial 
Classification System’s transportation and warehousing designation represents the most direct 
measure of transportation’s economic contributions, transportation indirectly enables many other 
forms of economic activity and growth (Ebert, 2000).

The Prairies’ transportation network is extensive, with road, rail, and aviation providing options for 
the movement of people and freight. While the Prairies’ surface transportation network supports 
significant marine activity in other Canadian regions, marine transportation plays a smaller role in 
the Prairies. Canada’s only Arctic port is located at Churchill, Manitoba. In 2016, due to reductions 
in the volume of grain being moved through the port, the owner of the Port of Churchill, OmniTRAX, 
announced the closure of the port for grain shipments. Currently, the port remains open for resupply 
to Nunavut. Figure 2 presents a visual overview of major transportation infrastructure in the Prairies.

Figure 2: Principle transportation infrastructure in the Prairies, including permafrost zones. Note that 
the National Road Network depicted in this figure includes winter roads.

2.1 ROAD TRANSPORTATION

The Prairies have a relatively high number of road-km per capita due to an extensive municipal and 
provincial road network, and a lower population density than the national average (3.3 versus 3.7 
persons per km2) (Statistics Canada, 2011). The Prairies account for 47 percent of Canada’s public 
roads, although this drops to 26 percent if only paved roads are considered (Transport Canada, 
2015). Saskatchewan accounts for almost half (48 percent) of the region’s total road-km (295,100 km), 
Alberta ranks second with 228,600 km (37 percent of Prairie road-km), followed by Manitoba, with 
91,700 km (15 percent) (Transport Canada, 2015). Figure 3 demonstrates the extent of the Prairies’ 
road network.

There is significant trucking activity in the Prairies; much of this supports an extensive agricultural 
export market. Key road-freight border crossings in the Prairies include Emerson (Manitoba), Coutts 
(Alberta), and North Portal (Saskatchewan). These crossings collectively accounted for 12 percent 
of Canada’s road trade with the United States in 2014, 9.2 percent of exports, and 14.2 percent of 
imports (Transport Canada, 2015).

2.1.1 WINTER ROADS

Winter roads (Figure 3) constitute an important part of the northern Prairies’ road network, providing 
seasonal access to remote communities and reducing the tonnage of goods requiring more 
expensive air delivery. Winter roads enable the delivery of food, fuel, medical supplies, and building 
materials (reducing the costs of these goods); support local economies; and provide access to 
healthcare and other parts of the region. 

Manitoba’s winter roads typically operate from mid-January to mid-March, extend approximately 
2,500 km, and serve 28 communities with a total population of 30,000 (Taylor and Perry, 2014). 
Comparably, winter roads in Alberta and Saskatchewan (with similar operating seasons) are modest: 
Alberta operates two routes totaling 447 km, while Saskatchewan’s three winter roads cover 274 km 
(Federal/Provincial/Territorial Sub-working Group on Northern Transportation, 2015). There is significant 
concern that warmer winters associated with changing climate conditions will result in shorter 
operational seasons for freight operators; however, as discussed in Section 4.5 and Case study 3, 
recent years have witnessed longer seasons (Sauchyn and Kulshreshtha, 2008).

Rail transportation makes a significant contribution to freight movement in the Prairies. Three Class-I 
railways3 (Canadian National - CN, Canadian Pacific - CP, and Burlington Northern and Santa 
Fe - BNSF) carry the vast majority of regional rail freight. Most tracks are located in areas without 
permafrost. One exception is the rail line connecting Churchill, Manitoba with supply-chain hubs to 
the south (Figure 2).

Although the operational length of Canada’s rail network has declined in recent years, the Prairies 
have resisted this trend. As of 2012, the regional network had retained 94 percent of its 2008 length 
(Railway Association of Canada, 2015). In 2013:

•  Alberta had 6,679 km, used by CN, CP, Great Sandhills Railway, Alberta Prairie Railway Excursions, 

Great Canadian Railtour Company, and VIA; 

•  Saskatchewan had 8,181 km, used by CN, CP, Carlton Trail, Great Western, Great Sandhills 

Railway, and VIA; and 

•  Manitoba operated 4,448 km, used by CN, CP, BNSF, Central Manitoba, Hudson Bay, and VIA. 

In all three provinces, freight comprises approximately 98 percent of track usage (based upon fuel 
consumption), with passenger traffic accounting for the remainder. In 2009, 39 million tonnes of rail 
freight originated in Alberta, 27 million tonnes in Saskatchewan, and 10.6 million tonnes in Manitoba 
(Railway Association of Canada, 2015).

In 2013, three of Canada’s top-ten freight-rail border crossings were located in the Prairies: Warroad, 
Minnesota-Sprague, Manitoba; Portal, North Dakota-North Portal, Saskatchewan; and Pembina, North 
Dakota-Emerson, Manitoba (Transport Canada, 2014).

2.3 AVIATION

Aviation is also an important mode of transport in the Prairies. There are five National Airport System 
airports in the region (serving Calgary, Edmonton, Saskatoon, Regina, and Winnipeg), which 
accounted for 22 percent (28.7 million) of Canada’s total enplaned/deplaned passengers in 2014 
(Transport Canada, 2015). Arrivals/departures at these airports accounted for 78 percent of the 
region’s passenger movements in 2014. 

Air freight is often chosen for higher-value shipments; therefore, air freight tends to account for a 
larger share of freight by value than by weight compared to other modes. Accounting for all inbound 
and outbound shipments in 2014 (both domestic and international), Manitoba moved 65,873 tonnes, 
Saskatchewan handled 12,077 tonnes, and Alberta accounted for 113,933 tonnes (Statistics Canada, 
2014b). Principal airports in Manitoba are shown in Figure 2. 

2.4 MARINE TRANSPORTATION

A review of marine transportation in the Prairies is essentially a review of the Port of Churchill in 
Manitoba (the Prairies’ only access to tidewater). Opened in 1931, the Port is an artery to northern 
Manitoba and the central Arctic region (Government of Manitoba, 2015a). In 2016, the private owner 
of the port, OmniTRAX, announced the closure of the port for grain shipments, due to the limited 
volume of grain moving through the port. Currently the port remains open, supporting resupply to 
communities located in Nunavut.

This refers to carriers with operating revenues exceeding $250 million (Railway Association of Canada, 2015).

 
CHAPTER 5: THE PRAIRIES

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Churchill is capable of handling Panamax-sized vessels with four berths totaling over 900m in length, 
although these facilities are modest compared to other Canadian ports. The Port of Churchill 
operates within (approximately) a 14-week shipping season, beginning in mid-July and extending to 
the end of October/early November. The shipping season is estimated to lengthen by two to three 
weeks over the 21st century in tandem with a shorter sea-ice season in the Hudson Strait (Hochheim 
and Barber, 2014), offering new opportunities for resource and resupply shipping (Lackenbauer and 
Lajeunesse, 2014). The seasonal duration of sea ice in this area has declined since record-keeping 
began in the 1970s (Tivy et al., 2007; Hochheim and Barber, 2014).

3.0 CLIMATE PROFILE

The Prairies are generally characterized by extreme differences in seasonal temperatures (an annual 
range of more than 70˚C), and high year-to-year variability in precipitation (resulting in frequent 
flooding and recurrent drought). Because of the region’s mid-latitude location in the rain shadow 
of the Rocky Mountains, the climate is generally cold and sub-humid (Sauchyn and Kulshreshtha, 
2008). The region’s southern core has a sub-humid climate that becomes semi-arid during periods 
of drought (Lemmen et al., 1998). Water balance increases moving west, north, and east from this 
core area. Snow is a critical form of seasonal water storage throughout the region. Chinook winds, 
that can raise air temperatures by more than 20˚C and rapidly deplete snow cover, are a common 
winter phenomenon in the foothills and prairies of the southwest. Severe summer storms and lightning 
– often associated with damaging hail (Kovacs and Thistlethwaite, 2014) and, occasionally, tornadoes 
(Environment Canada, 2015a) – are key climate risks in the Prairies.

In the context of a changing climate, increasing water scarcity represents a risk to the region. Also, 
the Prairies are likely to lose advantages associated with cold winters, particularly as they relate to 
winter roads (Sauchyn and Kulshreshtha, 2008).

3.1 PAST TRENDS

Instrumental climate records on the Prairies extend more than 120 years. Despite high year-to-year 
variability, long-term records demonstrate increasing mean annual temperatures, ranging from 
0.9˚C at Calgary, Alberta, to 2.7˚C in Swift Current, Saskatchewan for the period 1895-2005 (Sauchyn, 
2010). For the period from 1948 to 2014, the warming trend in the southern Prairies was 1.5˚C, with 
northern areas experiencing even greater warming (approximately 1.8˚C) (Environment Canada, 
2015b). This warming is similar to the average increase for Canada as a whole (1.6˚C) (Environment 
Canada, 2015b) and is about twice the increase in mean global temperature over the same period 
(Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2013). The greatest warming is evident in winter and 
spring, with the least occurring in fall (Vincent et al., 2012).

In addition to significant variability between and among years, there is also significant spatial 
variability across the region. In examining mean annual temperature trends, research (Danny Blair 
and Ryan Smith, University of Winnipeg, personal communication, 2015) demonstrates that most of 
the region experienced no statistically significant change (at a 95% confidence level) for the 32-year 
period from 1981 to 2013 (Figure 4). However, this indicates the importance of long-term records in 
defining climate trends. For the 60-year period from 1950 to 2010, Vincent et al. show statistically-
significant increases in mean annual temperature for almost all sites in the Prairies, and no sites in the 
region show a cooling trend (Vincent et al., 2012; Bush et al., 2014).

per-century trends. (Source: Danny Blair)

Trends in mean annual precipitation for the Prairies are much weaker than trends in mean annual 
temperature. This reflects, in part, the large differences in yearly precipitation, with the driest regions 
experiencing the largest inter-annual variability of any records in Canada (Sauchyn, 2010). Again, 
spatial variability is important (Figure 5). The 60-year record (1950-2010) shows statistically-significantly 
changes at only a handful of sites on the Prairies, and these show both increasing and decreasing 
precipitation (Bush et al., 2014).

Only areas in red on the inset map show statistically-significant changes. The scale bar depicts per 
century trends. (Source: Danny Blair)

While trends in total precipitation remain poorly defined, the annual number of days experiencing 
precipitation has increased. Heavy precipitation events show no strong trend, with sites recording 
both increases and decreases in the number of heavy precipitation days for the period from 1950 to 
2010 (Bush et al., 2014). Like other sites in southern Canada, the Prairies are experiencing a decrease 
in the snow-to-rain ratio (Mekis and Vincent, 2011). While no trend is evident in the frequency and 
severity of drought in the Prairies over the 20th century (Bonsal et al., 2011), global analysis shows a 
trend towards more severe drought conditions over Western Canada during the second half of the 
20th century (Dai, 2011; Seneviratne et al., 2012). 

 
CHAPTER 5: THE PRAIRIES 

115
115

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Trends in extreme weather in the Prairies are also important. Research suggests that May-June 
precipitation over the southeastern Prairies has increased significantly since the 1990s, possibly 
explaining observed changes in runoff patterns and recent extreme flood events (e.g. 2011 and 2014) 
(Szeto et al., 2015). 

3.2 PROJECTIONS

Temperatures in the Prairies are projected to rise under all climate scenarios, with associated changes 
in evapotranspiration leading to increased aridity in many areas (Sauchyn and Kulshreshtha, 2008). 
Under a low-emissions scenario, warming will increase only slightly from historic trends; however, under 
a high-emissions scenario, increases exceeding 6˚C are possible this century (Bush et al., 2014). The 
greatest warming will continue to be experienced in winter, with the least occurring during summer.  

Figure 6:  Projected changes in sea level for 
Churchill, Manitoba. Under almost all 
scenarios, sea level will fall as a result of glacial 
isostatic adjustments, despite the fact that 
global sea level will continue to rise. See 
Atkinson et al. (2016) for scenario descriptions 
and James et al. (2014) for projected sea-level 
changes by decade. (Source: Natural 
Resources Canada)

Projections of precipitation changes show 
total precipitation increasing over the northern 
Prairies, with relatively minor changes projected 
for southern areas (Bush et al., 2014). Again 
changes are more significant under higher-
emission scenarios. In the southwestern 
Prairies, decreases in summer precipitation are 
projected under high-emission scenarios. While 
the southern Prairies have been identified as a 
region with a higher likelihood of experiencing 
more frequent drought in future (Bonsal et al., 
2013), there is no strong agreement between 
projections of various climate models (Bush 
et al., 2014). Instances of extreme rainfall 
are likely to increase in tandem with warmer 
temperatures, while instances of freezing rain 
are likely to increase while snow cover declines 
over the 21st century (Kharin and Zwiers, 2000; 
Bush et al., 2014).

Sea level changes are important for the Port of 
Churchill. Currently, the land at Churchill is rising 
at a rate of 9.3 mm/year, a product of glacial 
isostatic adjustment as the earth’s crust responds 
to the melting of the ice sheets more than 10,000 
years ago (Atkinson et al., 2016). This strong 
vertical uplift means that sea level at Churchill 
will continue to fall through the current century, 
despite rising global sea level. The projected 
range of sea-level decline at Churchill is about 
35 to 40 cm by 2050, and 60 to 80 cm by 2100, 
although a decrease of more than 1 m is possible 
by 2100 (James et al., 2014) (Figure 6). Even 
under a very high global sea-level rise scenario, 
sea level at Churchill would not likely rise by more 
than a few centimeters.

Shifting climate and weather conditions will affect all modes of transportation in the Prairies. Examples 
of these impacts include:

•  Damage to roads, railways, and other structures as a result of flooding, erosion, and landslides;

• 

Increased frequencies of freeze-thaw cycles over the short term, damaging roads, rails, and 
runways;

•  Compromised frozen substrates of winter roads; and 

• 

Increased rutting of heated pavement (Sauchyn and Kulshreshta, 2008).

The Prairies may also experience benefits associated with warmer winters, including:

•  Cost reductions associated with non-ice road infrastructure;

•  Reductions in the length and severity of the frost-affected season, potentially resulting in long-term 

repair and maintenance cost savings; and

•  Reduced cold-weather damage to rails (Sauchyn and Kulshreshtha, 2008).

Each mode can be expected to respond differently to climate-related risks. Sections 4, 5, 6, and 7 discuss 
past climate impacts, future risks, and adaptation practices separately for road, rail, air, and marine. 

4.0 ROAD TRANSPORTATION

4.1 IMPACTS ON ROAD INFRASTRUCTURE

Extreme precipitation events create problems for roadway drainage. Truckers in the Prairies report an 
increased frequency of roadway flooding during extreme precipitation events, which may be partly 
attributed to inadequate culvert capacity (Kim Graybiel, Saskatchewan Ministry of Environment, 
personal communication, 2015). Washout and bridge scour may also occur as a result of extreme 
precipitation (Transportation Research Board, 2008).

Greater variability in temperature contributes to more rapid deterioration of road infrastructure. It is 
expected that the Prairies will experience an increase in the frequency of freeze-thaw cycles by mid-
century (Sauchyn and Kulshreshtha, 2008), stressing road surfaces and bridges and increasing renewal 
and replacement costs (Amiro et al., 2014). Extreme heat causes asphalt pavements to rut and bleed 
(Transportation Research Board, 2008). 

Drought has also had negative impacts on road infrastructure in the Prairies. Greater Edmonton 
experienced drought conditions from 2014-2015, leading to severe cracking of roadways as a result of 
desiccation of clay sub-soils; this can be explained in part due to the removal of water by vegetation 
(Kelm and Wylie, 2008) – damage was particularly severe in neighbourhoods with mature tree stands. 
Wildfires occurring during droughts typically do not seriously damage road infrastructure, given the 
inflammability of pavements and the relatively brief duration of these events.

Precipitation poses issues year-round to truck operators, and standing water on roadways is a 
particular concern in spring (Alberta- and Manitoba-based trucking practitioners; Alberta Motor 
Transport Association Representatives, personal communication, 2015). Increasing instances of 
freezing rain and extreme precipitation over the long term increase the likelihood of accidents and 
reduced travelling speeds (Transportation Research Board, 2008; Andrey and Mills, 2003).  

Wind is also a concern. More frequent high-intensity wind events in recent years have generated 
scheduling challenges and have increased safety concerns for trucking operators, particularly for 
long combination vehicles (LCVs) on highways (Alberta- and Manitoba-based trucking practitioners, 
personal communication, 2015).   

While changing temperatures themselves do not significantly affect trucking operations, increased 
temperatures in the long-term may positively affect road transportation efficiency in the Prairies. To a 
point, higher ambient temperatures improve diesel fuel efficiencies (Lohse-Busch et al., 2013; Natural 
Resources Canada, 2016). 

Additionally, wildfires (resulting from persistent dry conditions) continue to cause disruptions to 
road transportation seasonally throughout the region – road and highway closures often occur in 
conjunction with fire and smoke (CBC News, 2015a).

4.3 ADAPTATIONS FOR ROAD INFRASTRUCTURE

Provincial governments have been active in implementing adaptive strategies. For instance, 
Manitoba has initiated a program to flood-proof roads, focusing on key trade routes such as the 
Provincial Trunk Highway (PTH) 75 to the U.S. and routes to the west. This adaptive strategy includes 
elevating roads, increasing culvert capacities, redirecting water flows, and paving gravel roads to 
reduce washout risks (Transportation and the Environment Task Force, 2014).

Other infrastructure adaptations involve the use of flexible regulations. For example, Manitoba’s 
Spring Road Restrictions program previously enforced fixed start- and end-dates for its axle-weight 
restriction season (Manitoba Infrastructure and Transportation Staff, personal communication, 2015). 
These restrictions minimize road damage from heavy trucks during the spring thaw when roadbeds 
are relatively soft. In response to more variable temperature and weather conditions, the program 
has been adjusted to allow variable start and end dates (Government of Manitoba, 2015b). The 
complementary Winter Weight Premium Policy has been similarly modified (Manitoba Infrastructure 
and Transportation Staff, personal communication, 2015). Adjusting these programs cost very little 
relative to their benefits.

The Government of Manitoba is also reviewing its approach to water control on roadways to maintain 
traffic flow during extreme rainfall. Adaptation strategies under consideration include:

• 

• 

• 

• 

the use of larger drains and culverts to increase water-flow capacity; 

larger bridges capable of withstanding intense precipitation; 

the use of more appropriate erosion-control mechanisms such as riprap and dikes; and,

installing devices capable of monitoring bridge scour in real time during significant flood events.  

The province is also assessing design standards for provincial bridges and culverts to determine if 
updates are required to accommodate changes in climate, land use, surface water drainage, and 
flood vulnerability (Government of Manitoba, 2015c). Major floods in 2011 and 2014 catalyzed many 
of these efforts. 

 
CHAPTER 5: THE PRAIRIES 

118
118

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016With respect to possible temperature extremes, Manitoba Infrastructure and Transportation currently 
requires that bridge and large-culvert construction materials be designed to withstand a temperature 
range of 80°C (-40°C to +40°C). To mitigate impacts of freeze-thaw cycles, highly durable and 
impermeable concrete mixes are required for bridge decks and curbs/barriers, reducing moisture 
infiltration and expansion (Government of Manitoba, 2015c).

Alberta’s provincial government has undertaken climate risk assessments for road infrastructure. In 
June 2012, Alberta’s Ministry of Transportation released its “Climate Change Risk Assessment and 
Adaptation Report for the Ministry of Transportation,” a high-level assessment of risks posed by a 
changing climate to the province’s transportation sector. It also identifies potential adaptation 
measures, developed in accordance with ISO 31000 Risk Management Principles and Guidelines. 
During the department’s enterprise risk-management and business-planning processes, long-term risks 
(based on climate scenarios for the next 50 years) were considered along with risks in the near (2 -to 
10-year) term. Plans also exist to review climate risks as new and updated climate change scenarios 
become available, and identify potential options to reduce the severity of impacts (ICF Marbek, 
2012). 

In June 2013, Southern Alberta experienced heavy rainfall followed by catastrophic flooding. Five 
people were killed, more than 100,000 were displaced, and damage exceeded $5 billion (see 
Chapter 9). In terms of insurable damages, it is the costliest disaster in Canadian history (Environment 
Canada, 2014). In response, Alberta announced several risk-mitigation actions. In November 2013, the 
provincial government announced $110 million (2014-2016) for a Flood Mitigation Program, providing 
funds to upgrade, retrofit, or replace road and bridge infrastructure at high-risk sites in advance of 
scheduled end-of-life replacement. Specific repairs and upgrades to damaged sites were expected 
to account for $40 million, with the remaining $70 million dedicated to high priority sites susceptible 
to flood damage (Government of Alberta, 2013). Additional adaptive measures undertaken are 
discussed in Case Studies 1 and 2.

In addition to these long-term planning initiatives, Alberta government representatives indicate that 
a case-by-case approach to infrastructure adaptation is being taken in the province. Calgary’s 2013 
flood is often cited as motivation for efforts to reduce extreme-weather risks; however, most damage 
occurred in known floodplains. While changing climate factors may have contributed to high water 
levels, development in vulnerable areas was a factor contributing to the magnitude and costs of the 
damage (Alberta Government Staff, personal communication, 2015). 

Saskatchewan’s provincial government is attempting to build climate risks into asset-management 
processes, although budget realities often make the final determination (Kim Graybiel, Saskatchewan 
Ministry of Environment, personal communication, 2015). In response to extreme weather events, 
Saskatchewan’s culvert program alters design requirements for National Highway System infrastructure 
from 1-in-25 year flood-event thresholds to 1-in-50 year events. For vulnerable communities, standards 
are being changed from a 1-in-50 year event to a 1-in-100 year event (Transportation and the 
Environment Task Force, 2014). The objective of this strategy is to facilitate more efficient overland 
movement of water, to reduce incidences of water being held back by road or rail beds to the point 
where washouts occur.

CASE STUDY 1: ALBERTA TRANSPORTATION’S ADAPTATION 
EFFORTS IN THE ROAD SECTOR

Alberta Transportation has developed a number of initiatives that consider climate and extreme weather in 
highway and bridge design processes. Highlights include:

Bridges: Following the June 2013 flood, Alberta Transportation reviewed its standards for sizing, configuring, 
and protecting bridge openings. The Department concluded that existing standards were appropriate, 
and no changes were proposed – most damage occurred at older crossings not designed to current 
standards. Risks to stream crossings associated with increasing frequency and magnitude of storm events 
were also assessed, and were considered low for the following reasons:

• 

• 

• 

Stream crossings are sized to match the capacity of the stream channel. It takes decades (or longer) 
for natural channels to change permanently in response to climate changes. Therefore, there is a low 
risk of sudden change in bridge-opening capacity requirements.

Sizing of bridge openings is not overly sensitive to small changes in design flow (e.g. <20 percent).

The frequency of longer-duration storms that cause flooding in large natural basins is not considered 
likely to change in comparison to the frequency of high-intensity, short-duration, limited-area storms. 
This concurs with the absence of observed significant trends in frequency or magnitude of storms in the 
province’s 150-year historical record.

Bridge-deck drainage design requirements were also evaluated, focusing on sites where drainage 
blockages have occurred and maintenance is commonly required. Localized, high-intensity weather 
events are difficult to predict in timing or magnitude, and are more common than large regional floods. 
As a result, the most cost-effective method to address culvert blockages is to design infrastructure in 
ways that facilitate proper maintenance, a policy reflected in conceptual design guidelines for bridges 
in the province. For instance, a culvert structure at Malcolm Creek (built in the late 1990s) was filling with 
debris almost annually (not due to storms) and costs to clear the opening were significant. The culvert 
was recently replaced by a bridge configured to be more easily maintained (relocation was not feasible). 
Similarly, concrete box culverts at Cougar Creek were prone to blockage, and are now designed to 
be cleared by machinery. Finally, the Drystone Creek Bridge was designed with the knowledge that a 
significant portion of the opening would be filled in periodically. 

Surface engineering: Observed temperatures are considered in two design procedures related to 
roadway-surface engineering. The first is pavement-thickness design – daily ambient temperatures provide 
an input to pavement-response modeling under various traffic loads. The second is the selection of asphalt 
mixes: traffic loadings and summer temperatures are the main inputs in selecting asphalt binders and mix 
types (rutting is a primary concern). In each case, Alberta Transportation considers changes in climate 
factors minor compared to changes in other factors such as traffic loads and changes to allowable axle 
combinations or tire sizes; however, both procedures can be adjusted to reflect future temperature and 
precipitation projections. Note that increasing storm frequency and intensity is not currently considered in 
these procedures.

Geotechnical engineering: On average, Alberta experiences one “debris flood” (differing from hydraulic 
floods by the amount and type of sediment carried) per year. These events are common in mountainous 
terrain when three-day rainfall exceeds 300 mm. During the extreme rainfall in summer 2013, more than 
70 were recorded in a two-day span, blocking roadways and culverts. Alberta Transportation designs 
mountain creek bridges and culverts for hydraulic floods; however, 2013’s events provided an opportunity 
to re-evaluate conventional hydraulic sizing criteria to consider debris flooding, which were not previously 
considered in the risk-management framework. Mountain creeks behave less predictably than rivers in the 
Prairies, and require different design criteria. Alberta Transportation is in the process of determining if risk-
mitigation options are required, feasible, and economically-viable to deal with future debris flow events. 
A less-understood impact is the significant increase in tractive and erosive forces within debris floods and 
the action of these forces on mountain creek beds/banks. Predicting how streams will change course is 
difficult, as is determining the resilience of Alberta’s highways to future debris floods.

More frequent intense rainfall events also increase the risk of slope failures. Small failures may have no 
immediate impact on the driving surface, but over time may block ditch drainage (if located on the 
backslope), or eventually reach the pavement (if located on the foreslope). Alberta Transportation has not 
changed slope design criteria to meet these design conditions, as the cost to make all slopes more rain-
resistant would be prohibitive. Standard designs are in development to allow staff to repair shallow slope 
failures at minimal cost.

CASE STUDY 2: CLIMATE VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT FOR 
QUESNELL BRIDGE, CITY OF EDMONTON

The Public Infrastructure Engineering Vulnerability Committee (PIEVC) Engineering Protocol, led by 
Engineers Canada, was developed as a 5-step process to analyze the engineering vulnerability of 
individual infrastructure systems based on current climate and future climate projections.  One of the 
first PIEVC assessment projects in Canada was undertaken at Quesnell Bridge in Edmonton, Alberta. This 
assessment was unique in that the bridge had reached the end of its lifecycle and was scheduled for 
refurbishment; therefore, many components were reconsidered in light of the protocol’s recommendations. 
The study concluded that while “generally robust”, the bridge faces a number of future vulnerabilities to 
likely increases in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, such as:

•  wearing of the bridge’s exposed deck surface and water-proofing membranes, and

•  overloading of the deck drainage systems and retention pond.

The PIEVC assessment identified risks to operations/maintenance (e.g. snow clearing) and serviceability/
safety from future combinations and sequences of extreme events (e.g. road flooding, icing). As a result, 
the study recommended that the bridge’s design criteria be updated to include changing annual climate 
loadings and extreme weather events under climate change scenarios; in some cases, climate data 
contributing to the development of rehabilitated infrastructure components (surface and drainage) dated 
from the 1960s (City of Edmonton, 2008).

Reconstruction of the bridge was completed in 2011. The PIEVC assessment informed waterproofing and 
paving of the bridge’s west side, the creation of new stormwater-management facilities, and the addition 
of two general-traffic lanes and one transit-priority lane (City of Edmonton, 2011).

Trucking firms in the Prairies are adapting operations in a number of ways. For instance, truckers are 
adapting to more frequent high winds by choosing single trailer loads rather than doubles more often 
to reduce the potential for blow-over (Bison Transport Staff, personal communication, 2015). Due to 
high winds and bad weather, road tractors pulling double loads are sometimes required to drop off 
the rear trailer at a waypoint along their route, particularly if the second trailer is particularly light or 
empty (Bison Transport Staff, personal communication, 2015).

Truckers are also adopting technologies that enhance operational resilience to changing climate 
variables, although this tends to be a secondary benefit. For example, aerodynamic adaptations 
such as fairings and trailer skirts tend to be used to save fuel, but also enhance stability during wind 
events. Auxiliary power units (APUs) used by trucking firms are being refined and improved to respond 
to increased frequency of cold snaps or heat waves and reduce fuel consumption while idling. APUs 
provide non-idling power for on-board systems during the truck’s “down time” at the side of the road 
or in rest stops. New APU designs are more appropriate for a wider range of environmental conditions, 
although this adaptation represents a major expense for trucking firms. Commercial trucking dispatch 
networks and other third-party “dashboard” providers have also been proactive in forwarding road 
condition information to road-tractor fleets. 

Trucking firms have also devoted greater resources to weather monitoring, in some cases creating full-
time positions for real-time monitoring of weather events throughout a firm’s network. Some estimates 
suggest that there has been a five-fold increase in staff time spent on weather monitoring, with 
real-time linkages to dispatch offices. This enhances trucking firms’ ability to quickly redirect traffic in 
response to traffic disruptions (Bison Transport Staff, personal communication, 2015).

Provincial governments also provide monitoring services to aid traffic flow. In Saskatchewan, the 
Road Conditions Highway Hotline is regularly updated with current information provided by road users 
and Government staff, available through multiple delivery systems (high-speed and low- bandwidth 
internet, RSS feed, and plain text) (Government of Saskatchewan, n.d.). Similarly, the Government of 
Manitoba operates a Road Weather Information System (RWIS), which uses road sensors and cameras 
to supplement staff inspections. This technology primarily focuses on extreme events such as snow 
storms, flooding, and construction delays on high-traffic routes, although some lower-traffic routes and 
winter roads are within its reporting range. Travelers can monitor road conditions via websites, email 
updates, and social media (Government of Manitoba, 2015d). In Alberta, road information (including 
weather and traffic delays) is also available online.

4.5 WINTER ROADS   

Winter roads face a number of unique challenges related to increasing temperatures. While season 
lengths vary by road, most ice roads in the Prairies operate for approximately eight weeks from mid-
January to mid-March. Research suggests that warmer winters are having a negative impact on 
winter-road construction and maintenance costs, as well as reducing the reliability and operating-
season length (Federal/Provincial/Territorial Sub-working Group on Northern Transportation, 2015). 
However, recent data suggest these findings are not consistent throughout the Prairies. In Alberta, the 
Fort Chipewyan road has experienced a slightly longer season in recent years (Federal/Provincial/
Territorial Sub-working Group on Northern Transportation, 2015). In Saskatchewan, the Cumberland 
House road may have experienced slightly delayed opening dates in recent years, but closing dates 
have also been delayed (Federal/Provincial/Territorial Sub-working Group on Northern Transportation, 
2015). Manitoba is also experiencing irregularities in the winter road season (Case Study 3). 

Shorter winter road seasons can result in significant social and economic impacts. Governments and 
businesses use these roads to transport important supplies such as chemicals, fuel, and other daily 
essentials for residents, businesses, and public utilities (CBC News, 2012a). Residents use ice roads to 
access urban areas and purchase supplies in bulk, reducing the household impact of high living-costs

from trucks to aviation for essential goods is required, at great expense to all users (Taylor and Parry, 
2014). When ice roads eventually open in mild winters, load restrictions can be applied (CBC News, 
2012b). Recent winter-road experiences in Manitoba are discussed in Case Study 3.

CASE STUDY 3: WINTER ROADS IN MANITOBA

Manitoba has the majority of the Prairies’ winter roads (78 percent of winter road km), serving 30,000 
people in 28 remote communities (Taylor and Parry, 2014). In Northern Manitoba, winters from 1998 to 2003 
and 2009 to 2012 featured below-average operating seasons on most roads (Taylor and Parry, 2014; Table 
1). Between 2007 and 2011, the average cost of the winter-road network rose to $13 million annually, and 
funding for winter roads has tripled since 1998 (Rabson, 2012; Manitoba Infrastructure and Transportation, 
2011). In 2012, the province’s 2500 km network opened several weeks later than normal, prompting 
Northern Chiefs to declare a state of emergency (CBC News, 2012b). 

Despite a decline in season length from 2009 to 2012, data for routes in Manitoba (Table 1) suggest 
operating windows have recovered in recent years. Seasons from 2013 to 2015 slightly exceeded the 
12-season average from 2003 to 2015 (48 operational days). Over this period, MIT recorded opening and 
closing dates for up to 50 distinct road segments operated in the major East Side Lake Winnipeg (ESLW) 
area. Routings were frequently changed, often to move the roads off ice-covered waterways and onto 
land routes (Taylor and Parry, 2014). Routing changes presented some challenges in efforts to quantify 
winter-road operating days, but these changes likely extended operational seasons for many routes. A shift 
towards more land-based roads has also offered greater safety during construction, maintenance, and 
use (Taylor and Parry, 2014). However, operating days are not the only relevant variable – many factors are 
involved in determining the relative success of different winter road seasons in moving goods to remote 
areas in recent years.  These include routing changes, the polar vortex breakup of 2013-2014, varying 
weight restrictions, frost depth, snow cover, etc. 

Future projections estimate average loss to the province’s future ice-road season at eight days by the 
2020s, 15 days by mid-century, and 21 days by the 2080s (Sauchyn and Kulshreshtha, 2008). In light of 
these expected impacts, more drastic adaptation efforts – beyond shifting routes from waterways to land 
– are being made to improve reliability, particularly for remote communities.  For example, Manitoba is 
undertaking a large-scale infrastructure program ($3 billion over 30 years) to build permanent, all-weather 
roads in the ESLW area to serve remote communities with a collective population of approximately 
36,000 individuals (Manitoba East Side Road Authority, n.d.). The proposed routing of this network closely 
approximates the current winter-road network. While the rationale for this undertaking is multi-faceted, the 
following supportive statement was made by the Eastside Road Authority “ … over the years, the reliability 
and length of time that the winter roads are open has been lessening, resulting in hardships for local 
residents” (Manitoba East Side Road Authority, n.d.). 

Other potential adaptations being considered include shifts to modes less costly than conventional 
aviation such as, enhanced rail and ferry services (Manitoba Infrastructure and Transportation Staff, 
Government of Manitoba, personal communication, 2015). Manitoba Infrastructure and Transportation 
currently operates four ferries during open-water season. These ferries serve remote communities reliant 
on winter roads, in the areas of South Indian Lake, Split Lake, York Landing, Bloodvein, and Norway 
House (Taylor and Parry, 2014). Others have proposed airships as a potential substitute for ice roads 
and conventional aviation (CBC News, 2015b).

5.1 PAST IMPACTS AND FUTURE RISKS

EXTREME PRECIPITATION

Rail company geotechnical engineers cite challenges with surface water and drainage related to 
extreme precipitation, including the fouling of track ballast and increasing risks of washouts. Fouling 
limits the ballast’s ability to shed water away from the track area (Michael Hendry, Canadian 
Rail Research Laboratory, University of Alberta, personal communication, 2015) and reduces 
the resistance of rail infrastructure to frost heaves (shifting soil or rock during freezing conditions) 
(Nurmikolu and Silvast, 2013). 

Anecdotally, standing water is an increasing problem. One long-time regional geotechnical 
expert indicated seeing water against-grade in Saskatchewan in places not seen in 30 years in the 
business (Tom Edwards, Canadian National Railway, personal communication, 2015). The situation is 
particularly problematic if culverts freeze in spring. Frozen culverts restrict water flow, increasing the 
risk of washout and the likelihood and severity of track damage (Figure 7) (Michael Hendry, Canadian 
Rail Research Laboratory, University of Alberta, personal communication, 2015). 

These consequences affect reliability and efficiency of rail movement, as well as profitability, as rail 
companies typically own infrastructure and incur any necessary costs to maintain tracks to federal 
standards.

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016EXTREME TEMPERATURES

The ideal temperature range for freight-rail operations is -25°C to +25°C (Miller, 2014). While thermal 
rail expansion (buckling due to heat) has rarely been cited as an issue in the Prairies, extreme cold 
is a major concern for winter rail operations (Boyle et al., 2013). In cold temperatures, steel tracks 
(continuously welded rail) and wheels become more brittle and susceptible to breakage, and air-
braking systems become more prone to leaks and freezing. A review of Transportation Safety Board 
of Canada rail incident reports suggests that cold weather-related rail fractures have contributed to 
some derailments in the Prairies (Transportation Safety Board of Canada, 2013). Cold temperatures 
also create operational issues by limiting the safe length of trains. According to the Rail Association 
of Canada, the maximum safe length of an intermodal train with distributed power decreases by 15 
percent below 25°C and 39 percent below -35°C. Shorter trains operating in a network near capacity 
with relatively long cycle times results in cascading effects throughout the rail system. Increased 
congestion in terminals limits efficiency, while greater train density in a given area results in more trains 
encountering one another, increasing use of sidings and further reducing average speeds (Miller, 
2014). Extreme cold temperatures were an important contributing factor to delays in grain handling in 
the winter of 2013-2014 (Case Study 4).

While instances of extreme cold are projected to decrease in the Prairies, these periods will still occur 
at unpredictable intervals (Bush et al., 2014). During periods of extreme heat in the 21st century, rail 
buckling risks will also increase (Transportation Research Board, 2008). These impacts illustrate both 
current and future risks posed by temperature extremes to rail-freight transportation.

CASE STUDY 4: RAIL-FREIGHT MOVEMENT IN WINTER 2013-2014 

Moving grain to port via rail in the Prairies in the winter of 2013-2014 has been described as a “perfect 
storm” of issues (Cash, 2014). Grain handling in the region is a complex process involving many actors. In 
this particular year, a series of events and conditions complicated the process further, including:

•  an above-average Prairie crop yield;

• 

• 

the removal of the Canadian Wheat Board single-desk marketing mechanism;

increased orders for car placement by grain companies wishing to move product;

•  delayed initial orders for car placement; and

•  an extremely cold winter in the Prairies (Miller, 2014; Atkins, 2014).

As illustrated in Figure 8, most of the Prairies experienced lower-than-average temperatures in winter 
2013-2014 – up to 4.5°C lower in some areas. The following discussion is based primarily upon information 
regarding CN operations during this period.

In the 2013-2014 winter season, trains operated below the -25°C threshold more frequently than normal (Miller, 
2014). Rail companies experienced several difficulties, including air brake hose leaks (compromising braking 
capacity), more frequent rail breaks (200 percent higher than non-winter norms), and more frequent steel 
wheel breaks. 

In response, rail companies reduced train lengths and speeds. Average grain-train length was reportedly 
70 percent as long as it could have been under ideal temperature conditions. This caused a cascading 
effect, primarily driven by increased network congestion.  

Average train speed was also reduced over this period. In winter, trains normally operate at speeds approximately 
8 percent lower than in other seasons. In 2013-2014, this reduction was approximately 13 percent. As a result of 
shorter and slower trains, the car-order fulfillment rate (the ratio of orders filled on schedule to orders placed) 
decreased by over 30 percent compared to non-winter seasons, compared to the winter norm of 15 percent.

dispatch systems are down, requiring slower train movements and positioning until the system is normalized. 
The bar graph shows the significant increase in CTC outages in 2013-2014, creating systemic vulnerability.

Increasing freeze-thaw cycles (a trend expected to continue) are generating more frequent 
rockslides, affecting rail operations in mountainous areas (Middleton, 2000). Freeze-thaw cycling also 
creates problems for track stability, particularly in the region’s northern reaches (Middleton, 2000). 

Extreme snow and wind events can delay rail services, particularly in combination. Strong winds are 
expected to present scheduling challenges in future, requiring trains to reduce speeds or move to 
sidings (Miller, 2014). 

Hudson Bay Railway is uniquely affected by permafrost thaw. This line is critical to operations at the 
Port of Churchill, and also for local residents – grain-car derailments have resulted in passenger service 
cancellations due to the absence of alternate routes (Wang et al., 2016). Reliability may become 
increasingly difficult to maintain if adaptations are not made (Case Study 5).

CASE STUDY 5: RAIL IN THE HUDSON BAY LOWLANDS: A SPECIAL 
CIRCUMSTANCE

Manitoba’s most northerly rail line (terminating in Churchill) faces challenges associated with thawing 
permafrost and muskeg (Tweed, 2015). Muskeg provides a poor base for rail, primarily due to its low 
compressibility (Lautala et al., 2008). Rail shifts, sinks, or even rises as a result of frost heaves in these 
areas. The Hudson Bay Railway Rehabilitation program, an initiative jointly funded by the governments 
of Manitoba and Canada in partnership with the line’s operator, OmniTRAX, is a 10-year undertaking 
specifically designed to reduce the impacts of permafrost degradation and warmer temperatures on rail 
service, particularly from The Pas to Churchill. This initiative involves stabilization of the rail bed – to date, 
about $50 million has been spent on rehabilitation of the Bay Line since the program began in 2008 (Wang 
et al., 2016).

However, rail-line rehabilitation has not been as successful as initially hoped, due to challenges associated 
with the discontinuous permafrost and muskeg terrain. The rail line (and its original ballast) was laid over the 
winter of 1928-1929 atop frozen muskeg, the season when track stability is greatest. As temperatures warm, 
the ballast has been dissipating into the muskeg, resulting in more frequent remediation.  For example, in 
June-July 2014, OmniTRAX added 40,000 tonnes of ballast under the Gillam-to-Churchill section of the rail 
line (Tweed, 2015), following the previous year’s remediation effort, which added 15,000 tonnes of ballast.  
The company now considers backfilling an operational rather than a capital cost.  Recent research 
(Addison et al., 2015) confirms that stabilization measures have not been effective, and that deterioration is 
accelerating.

Given projections for long-term warming in the Hudson Bay Lowlands, supporting the rail bed will become 
increasingly difficult. In response, geotechnical engineers are developing adaptation strategies. 

As permafrost thaws, some technical efforts to stabilize the railway will increase in costs and difficulty 
(Wang et al., 2016), although others may become more feasible. One proposed measure involves lifting 
the track and adding a layer of gravel to insulate permafrost (enhancing stability), although the continued 
maintenance required makes this option challenging (Wang et al., 2016). Another approach to stabilizing 
muskeg in the rail bed involves mixing cement with the vegetative mat (provided shifting muskeg can be 
controlled); however, this option requires further testing and evaluation given that frozen substrate makes it 
difficult to mix cement into the muskeg (Eddie Choi, Canadian Pacific Railway, personal communication, 
2015). Permafrost thaw may enhance the viability of this stabilization technique, although the long-term 
effectiveness remains uncertain.

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 20165.2 RAIL ADAPTATIONS

A common adaptation to extreme rain events in the Prairies is to enhance culvert capacities. For 
example, the Canadian National Railway (CN) is planning to install main-line culverts with a capacity 
for 1-in-100 year rain events and enhance the capacity for branch lines culverts to a 1-in-50 year 
threshold. Some municipalities promote a 1-in-500 year threshold when negotiating culvert upgrades 
with railways (Mario Ruel, Canadian National Railway, personal communication, 2015). Geotechnical 
engineers indicate that while decisions are made on a case-by-case basis using the project 
engineer’s best professional judgment, a shift in perspectives is underway. While 1-in-100 year events 
have been the standard in the past, 1-in-200 year criteria are becoming a more common benchmark 
(Tom Edwards, Canadian National Railway, personal communication, 2015).

In some parts of the Prairies, rail and rail bridges are also being raised to higher grades in response 
to seasonal flood risks (Manitoba East Side Road Authority Representatives and Manitoba Floodway 
Representatives, personal communication, 2015). For example, along Winnipeg’s Red River Floodway, 
rail (and road) bridges have been raised to a 1-in-700 year event threshold (see Case Study 6).

In response to the increasing frequency of high-intensity wind events (both experienced and 
projected), wind sensors are being affixed to some rail bridges in the Prairies, particularly on the 
highest structures (Mario Ruel, Canadian National Railway, personal communication, 2015). With 
advance warning of high-intensity wind, train operators can delay passage over rail bridges, or adjust 
speeds accordingly. 

BNSF reports a greater use of snow fences on its network (Amiro et al., 2014). These assist in keeping 
tracks clear of snow drifts in the winter.

CASE STUDY 6: ROAD AND RAIL CONSIDERATIONS IN THE RED 
RIVER FLOODWAY EXPANSION PROJECT 

The Red River Floodway is designed to protect the City of Winnipeg, including its transportation 
infrastructure, from spring runoff flooding along the Red River, although it can be utilized during other 
times in response to extreme precipitation events in the watershed. Since 1968, it is estimated that the 
artificial floodway has prevented more than $40 billion (in 2011 dollars) in flood damage to Winnipeg. The 
structures and systems associated with the Floodway are collectively recognized as a National Historic Civil 
Engineering Site and considered one of the world’s 16 engineering marvels (Government of Manitoba, 
2011).

While the Floodway has operated well since its completion in 1968, recent severe flood events have 
caused planners to rethink the expected frequency of flood-disaster potential. The structure was designed 
to handle 60,000 cubic feet per second (cfs) of water, considered sufficient to protect Winnipeg from 
a 1-in-90 year event. Later upgrades brought the channel capacity to 90,000 cfs. A major flood in 1997 
reinforced concerns about the future frequency of extreme flooding, and planners began to consider that 
events formerly referred to as 1-in-200 year events may become 1-in-20 year events. In response, floodway 
capacity was further increased to 140,000 cfs to provide protection for a 1-in-700 year event, a capacity 
beyond the river’s largest flood on record (which occurred in 1826).

Expected shifts in climate and extreme weather were the main drivers behind the expansion of the Red 
River Floodway, but these changes were made for economic reasons as well. In the absence of road 
and rail bridge upgrades over the floodway channel, east-west road and rail movements and access to 
the Mid-Continent Corridor could be stopped or seriously curtailed during a flood event. This would have 
serious economic implications beyond Manitoba. A significant percentage of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and 
(to a lesser extent) Ontario trade destined for U.S. markets is routed through the I75/I29 portal.

Adaptive road and rail measures formed a major part of this expansion. Bridges were raised and piers 
modified to ensure road and rail traffic could continue unimpeded on the road network traversing the 
now-expanded floodway channel. Examples include:

•  PTH 59 South Highway Bridge: Two existing northbound and southbound road bridge structures were 

replaced. The new bridge structures are 4 m higher and 50 m longer than the previous structures.

• 

Trans-Canada Highway Bridge: The original bridge was replaced with two new bridge structures, 3.9 m 
higher and 98.6 m longer than the original bridge. 

•  PTH 15 Highway Bridge: The PTH15 Highway Bridge was replaced with a new structure approximately 

1.9 m higher than the previous bridge, with additional modifications. 

•  PTH 44 Highway Bridge: The PTH 44 Highway Bridge was replaced with a new structure 0.9 m higher and 

16 m longer than the previous structure, along with intersection improvements.  

•  CN Sprague Railway Bridge: The Sprague Railway Bridge, carrying the CN line, was replaced by a new 

bridge approximately 77 m longer and 2.7 m higher than the previous structure.

•  CN Redditt Railway Bridge: The new CN Redditt Railway Bridge is approximately 34 m longer and 2.3 m 

higher than the previous structure.

•  CP Keewatin Railway Bridge: The new CP Keewatin Railway Bridge is approximately 37 m longer and 

1.3 m higher than the previous structure.

While not specifically part of the Red River Floodway expansion, plans are underway to raise the level of 
PTH 75 south to the U.S. border in line with the level of Interstate-29 south of the Canada-U.S. border. This, in 
conjunction with the expansion of the Red River Floodway, will enhance the reliability of trucking along the 
Mid-Continent Corridor and its east-west linkages that connect Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba to 
central U.S. markets.

6.1 PAST IMPACTS AND FUTURE RISKS

Aircraft operators in the Prairies report several operational challenges associated with changing 
climate conditions and extreme weather, including:

• 

increased de-icing requirements,

•  greater frequency of flight delays occurring because the destination airport is closed,

•  wind events affecting approach-scheduling, and

•  cargo weight restrictions due to soft runways.

Greater frequency and severity of extreme weather (particularly precipitation) events are a major 
concern for aviation in the Prairies. Some air carriers operating in the Prairie provinces have reported 
an increased frequency of flight delays or cancellations, mainly in response to precipitation and fog 
events.  Airport representatives and provincial administrators of non-National Airport System airports 
and aerodromes have similarly cited concerns with a greater frequency of these events.   

Air operators in the northern Prairies have observed more significant changes than have operators 
in the south, and practitioners suggest that the costs of weather variability have been particularly 
difficult for small operators to internalize. The resilience (or adaptive capacity) of southern airports 
is generally higher than their northern counterparts as a result of more readily-available ground 
equipment and system redundancies (Calm Air Representatives, personal communication, 2015). 

Smaller airports in the northern Prairies have experienced specific challenges with standing water 
on runways. Particularly in springtime, precipitation percolates into the runway base, softening 
the surface area. When aircraft land on these softened runways, depressions are formed, 
allowing greater opportunity for the accumulation of standing water. In an effort to minimize 
the formation of depressions, carriers reduce their payloads (Calm Air Representatives, personal 
communication, 2015).

One carrier indicated that over the past few years, their operation had experienced a significant 
increase in delays due to weather variability, particularly in the northern Prairies. This has partly 
contributed to an increased need for aircraft de-icing. Increased variance in temperature has 
resulted in a greater frequency of ideal conditions for ice formation on the control surfaces of aircraft 
(Calm Air Representatives, personal communication, 2015). De-icing stations are rare in northern 
Prairie communities, often resulting in prolonged delays for aircraft departures.

Extreme cold also affects aviation operations. All aircraft have a range of temperature for which 
they are certified. This temperature range varies by aircraft, and by variant within an airframe type. 
An aircraft may be grounded, and prevented from making its return flight if temperatures drop 
quickly during its flight. In the Prairies, low temperatures currently pose a greater operational risk 
than high temperatures. For instance, in the cold winter of 2013-2014, some U.S. carriers’ scheduled 
flights to western Canada were cancelled because the aircraft were only certified to -30°C. Such 
scheduling disruptions have been reported to occur with greater frequency in response to more rapid 
temperature shifts, something to which the Prairies is prone. 

 
CHAPTER 5: THE PRAIRIES 

131
131

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 20166.2 ADAPTATION PRACTICES 

INFRASTRUCTURE 

Modifications have been made at airports in the Prairies to improve the ability of runways to shed 
precipitation (Perimeter Aviation Representatives, personal communication, 2015). For example, 
certain types of sealants are being used on gravel airstrips. These involve applying a ¾” to 1” thick 
layer of a water-shedding material, although the runway is still classified as a treated gravel airstrip. 
These sealants are used on some runways in Saskatchewan and Alberta, although are not yet 
reported on Manitoba gravel airstrips. The sealant assists in reducing the percolation of moisture into 
the runway base material, and instances of standing water, which helps to reduce traction issues for 
aircraft trying to land on shorter runways (International Civil Aviation Organization Secretariat, 2010). 

OPERATIONS

Air carriers operating in the Prairies report some changes to operations and equipment to better 
manage the challenges posed by weather and changing climate conditions. As an adaptation to 
scheduling disruptions in remote northern communities, carriers have expanded ground facilities 
(warehousing) so freight aircraft that have been delayed can offload outside the community’s normal 
business hours and continue on their route. Ground transportation services can then pick up and 
distribute freight during business hours.  Carriers in northern communities that lack de-icing stations are 
also using portable de-icing mechanisms to deal with more frequent icing. 

To adapt to more frequent fog events, one carrier in Saskatchewan has reported making scheduling 
changes to allow fog to dissipate, moving early morning departures to late morning for some 
communities (Lloyd Epp, West Wind Aviation, personal communication, 2015).

A potential adaptation to disruptions caused by temperature certification issues is to reduce the 
number of different aircraft types or configurations in a given fleet. While there are other operational 
reasons for minimizing the number of aircraft types in a fleet (i.e. simpler maintenance requirements), 
consistency in air temperature certification is a factor in the Prairies. 

7.0 MARINE TRANSPORTATION

This section identifies risks faced by vessels and ports in the context of a changing climate and 
patterns of extreme weather, and describes adaptive efforts to cope with these impacts. As the 
Prairies’ only access point to tidewater, the following discussion of issues focuses specifically on 
Churchill and its unique situation.

7.1 FUTURE CLIMATE IMPACTS AND OPPORTUNITIES 

The effects of global sea-level rise will not be experienced consistently across the globe. Certain 
areas in the higher northern latitudes, including Hudson Bay (and Churchill, Manitoba), are likely to 
continue to experience sea-level decline throughout the 21st century as a result of isostatic adjustment 
(glacial uplift) (Bush et al., 2014). Therefore, Churchill is likely to be one of the few ports in Canada not 
adversely affected by sea-level rise and more severe storm surges. At present, Churchill experiences 
3 m tides. Increased mean temperatures are likely to result in a shorter sea-ice season, extending 
Churchill’s shipping season (currently about 14 weeks). However, sea-level decline along Hudson Bay’s 
western coast could increase navigational challenges for large vessels attempting to take advantage 
of the extended season.

Transition measures were put in place to help the port adjust to the end of the Canada Wheat Board 
in 2012. Capital improvements funds were designed to encourage some diversity in port operations, 
expanding port capacity beyond its traditional focus on outbound bulk-grain handling to include 
other movement systems, including intermodal operations (Transportation and the Environment Task 
Force, 2014). Although these improvements are unlikely to be explicitly linked to climate change 
adaptation, a shift in short-sea shipping capacity may have implications for an extended marine 
resupply season.  The owner and operator of the Port of Churchill reports that water levels at the 
wharves have been trending downwards, suggesting the only adaptation that would be required is 
dredging of the harbour (Jeff McEachern, OmniTrax Canada, personal communication, 2015).

The Port of Churchill’s capacity to load vessels has been idle for much of each year, as the shipping 
season normally covers about 14 weeks from mid-July to late October. If the ice-free season is 
extended, more activity could be supported without substantial infrastructure improvements. 
Challenges remain for the Port of Churchill, although these are primarily inland, and deal with surface 
access to the port from southern shipping distribution points (discussed in Case Study 5). 

Case Study 7 describes the results and recommendations of a recent PIEVC assessment completed 
for transportation infrastructure connecting Manitoba and Nunavut, including Churchill’s marine 
components.

CASE STUDY 7: CLIMATE CHANGE VULNERABILITY AND THE 
MANITOBA-NUNAVUT SUPPLY CHAIN

A recent study (Duguid et al., 2015) examined key infrastructure supporting the supply of goods and 
services between Northern Manitoba and Nunavut’s Kivalliq region. The project aimed to identify potential 
vulnerabilities associated with a changing climate, northern economic development, and growing 
populations. Climate change is likely to put direct physical stress on this northern supply-chain infrastructure, 
while simultaneously increasing demand and performance expectations. The study’s recommendations 
included:

1.  Development and use of an integrated supply chain model that supports a systematic understanding 

of how decisions could affect the supply chain as a whole. 

2. 

Integrated governance for transportation infrastructure supporting the North. 

3. 

Integrated planning and strategic investment strategy for northern transportation infrastructure. 

The study analyzed the engineering vulnerability of the Port of Churchill, the Thompson Freight Services 
Hub, and the Rankin Inlet Airport to current and future conditions via the Public Infrastructure Engineering 
Vulnerability Committee (PIEVC) protocol. The assessment determined that none of the assets are at high 
risk of impact, although all three had numerous medium risks. It was recommended that medium risks 
be closely monitored and that most of these risks would affect operations, while very few would affect 
infrastructure. While some risks may be managed by increasing materials, labour, and costs, others cannot 
be controlled and in these cases, preparedness for interruptions and delays and regular maintenance of 
infrastructure were recommended.

However, while individual transportation facilities themselves may be relatively robust, the overall system 
may be vulnerable. The infrastructure – built with reference to historic levels of demand and climate trends 
– has been expanded on an ad hoc basis and focused on local needs, often without consideration for the 
impacts on the broader system and the communities it supports.

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016…

Examples of infrastructure vulnerabilities (“medium risks”) that could have significant implications for the 
supply chain include:

• 

the rail line between Thompson and Churchill, which has been heavily and repeatedly affected by 
permafrost degradation and is vulnerable to delays and disruptions; and

•  Highway 6 into Thompson, which may be vulnerable to closures due to forest fires or flooding.

8.0 INFORMATION GAPS AND CONCLUSIONS

This chapter summarizes the state of knowledge on climate impacts, risks, and adaptation 
practices for transportation systems in the Prairies, based on available literature and practitioner 
experiences. Several gaps were identified during the course of research. 

There is a lack of documented information on specific climate impacts and adaptation practices for 
transportation in the Prairies, suggesting few researchers have focused on this topic in the region.

There are gaps in climate data important to transportation operators. While long-term climate 
projections (temperature and precipitation) may be useful for long-term infrastructure planning, 
additional information would be useful on projected changes in the expected frequency and severity 
of extreme weather events. Prairie governments and operators have been investing in weather 
monitoring and communications to reduce risks from extreme weather, but more accurate predictions 
of the locations and timing of these events would be useful for short- and medium-term operational 
planning.  

There are gaps in transportation data that make it difficult to analyze trends, particularly for specific 
modes at the provincial and regional level. For example, data is not reported on the frequency of 
aircraft being redirected to alternate airports, or the frequency of aircraft “go-arounds” (i.e. aborted 
landings), so it is difficult to determine if there have been changes in the impacts of extreme weather 
events on  operational indicators at airports.

Despite these information gaps, governments and operators in the Prairies have been making efforts 
to reduce future climate risks to infrastructure and operations, particularly those associated with 
precipitation. Flood-control strategies, intended to reduce future risks of washout, represent key 
adaptation strategies in all three Prairie provinces.

At the same time, transportation operators in the Prairies have tended to take a reactive, case-
by-case approach to climate and weather adaptation. As information and knowledge improves 
on longer-term climate risks, transportation decision-makers in the Prairies will be able to be more 
proactive in their adaptation efforts.

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016KEY FINDINGS

•  Recent extreme weather events (in both summer and winter) demonstrate the vulnerability of 

Ontario’s transportation networks to climate-related impacts. The flooding of roads and rail 
lines in July 2013 and the ice storm of December 2013 in Southern Ontario resulted in significant 
damage and travel disruption, but also spurred greater organisational awareness of the region’s 
vulnerability to more frequent extreme weather. Multiple resilience-enhancing initiatives have 
been undertaken in the wake of these events by public agencies, particularly for roads and rail.

•  Warming temperatures and changing precipitation patterns are expected to contribute to altered 

(increased or decreased) water levels in the Great Lakes basin, with implications for shipping 
capacity in the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Seaway. Fluctuations over the past 20-30 years make it 
difficult to predict the direction of long-term change; however, freight transportation may shift to 
other modes should trends toward lower water levels throughout the Great Lakes occur again.

• 

The access period for winter roads in Northern Ontario is likely to decrease as a result of warming 
temperatures. This carries economic impacts for remote northern communities; a modal shift from 
truck to air transportation is likely to be necessary if significant investments are not made in more 
resilient road infrastructure in Northern Ontario. 

•  Practitioners in Ontario have begun to assess the vulnerability of their assets, and in some cases, 

adapt their infrastructure and operations in preparation for changing climate conditions. Efforts 
made by the Ontario Ministry of Transportation (roads and bridges), Metrolinx (rail), the Greater 
Toronto Airport Authority (aviation), and the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Seaway Management 
Corporation (marine shipping) reflect a diversity of adaptive practices employed in Ontario. 

1.0 REGIONAL INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW

Ontario is Canada’s second-largest province in terms of area, and largest in terms of population. 
While its population density (14.1 persons per km2) is significantly higher than the national average 
(3.7 persons per km2) (Statistics Canada, 2012), many areas of the province are remote, isolated from 
employment centres, urban markets, and international transportation hubs. Maintaining efficient and 
effective surface, marine, and air transportation systems for passengers and freight in this context 
is complex. A changing climate makes these challenges greater. Temperature and precipitation 
patterns are projected to shift considerably by mid-century, and projected increases in the frequency 
and intensity of severe weather events present serious risks for Ontario’s transportation system (e.g. 
flooded roadways, lower water levels) and potential socioeconomic consequences (e.g., costs, 
disruptions), in the absence of effective adaptation action. 

Not all effects of a changing climate will be negative. Most research has focused on the potential 
negative impacts of climate change, and positive impacts may not be well-understood (Chiotti and 
Lavender, 2008). While this chapter identifies potential opportunities and benefits as applicable, the 
primary focus is on transportation-related risks.

Ontario’s transportation network will be discussed with reference to three distinct sub-regions 
(northern, central, and southern [see Figure 1]) in order to capture the province’s geographic, 
social, and economic diversity; different capacities for climate change adaptation; and the unique 
adaptive measures required. While Ontario’s adaptive capacity is relatively high due to its aggregate 
economic wealth, education levels, infrastructure, social capital, and institutions, this capacity is not 
evenly distributed throughout the province (Chiotti and Lavender, 2008). Each sub-region is described 
briefly in the following section in terms of environmental, social, and economic characteristics. 
Note that while this chapter recognizes the importance of urban transportation networks in Ontario, 
municipal climate impacts and adaptation practices are discussed in Chapter 9.

as well as interviews with transportation practitioners across the province. The findings and discussion 
reflect the current state of knowledge on climate adaptation in Ontario; however, they should not be 
considered an exhaustive inventory of experiences, impacts, and adaptations.

1.1 GEOGRAPHY

SOUTHERN SUB-REGION

Ontario’s southern sub-region extends from Canada’s southernmost location (Point Pelee) east to the 
Quebec border. The topography ranges from flat in the southwest and southeast to rugged and hilly 
in the Niagara escarpment region (Chiotti and Lavender, 2008). It contains eight of Canada’s 16 most 
densely-populated metropolitan centres, including the urban regions of the Greater Golden Horseshoe 
(centered around the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area), and the City of Ottawa in the east. This 
sub-region features significant landscape modification for transportation networks, urban development, 
and agriculture.  Southwestern Ontario has a temperate, humid climate, with warm summers and 
cold winters. For communities in this area, the Great Lakes have a moderating effect on temperature, 
influence patterns of atmospheric convection (and therefore precipitation distribution and intensity) 
during the summer, and produce a “snowbelt” effect in the winter (Baldwin et al, 2011; Gula and Peltier, 
2012). Southeastern Ontario is characterized by relatively longer winters and shorter summers than in the 
southwest, although annual precipitation levels are comparable (Baldwin et al, 2011). 

 
CHAPTER 6: ONTARIO

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016CENTRAL SUB-REGION

The central sub-region, which includes Sudbury, Thunder Bay, and Timmins, is composed almost 
entirely of the forested and rocky terrain of the Precambrian Shield. Its summers are humid and mild, 
and precipitation is distributed evenly throughout the seasons (Baldwin et al, 2011). There are many 
low-density, resource-dependent communities, notably in the forestry, pulp-and-paper, mining, 
and tourism sectors. It contains two-thirds of Ontario’s highway system, which along with the rail 
network, is important in connecting the area’s resource producers to markets in other areas of the 
province, country, and continent (Chiotti and Lavender, 2008). The sub-region’s remote communities 
and extractive industries also depend greatly on more than 3,000 km of seasonal-access roads for 
economic well-being, social stability, and surface freight movement in winter (Ontario Ministry of 
Northern Development and Mines, 2013).

NORTHERN SUB-REGION

The northern sub-region extends from the upper boundary of Central Ontario to the coasts of Hudson 
and James Bay. The topography and landscape are largely low-lying and poorly-drained, containing 
the majority of the province’s permafrost in the cryosolic (i.e. frozen) soils of the northwest (Baldwin et 
al, 2011). Northern Ontario has a subarctic climate, with long, severe winters and short, cool summers. 
Temperatures of -40˚C are common (although temperature is highly variable year-round), and annual 
precipitation is lower than in other sub-regions (Baldwin et al, 2011). Northern communities are also 
remote, and many rely solely upon aviation for connectivity.

1.2 SOCIAL AND DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS

Ontario is the fastest-growing province in Canada, with an estimated population of 13.8 million in 2015 
(Statistics Canada, 2014, Table 1). Significant growth is expected to continue well into the 21st century, 
with implications for future demands on passenger and freight transportation systems throughout the 
province. Approximately 17.4 million people are projected by 2036 (Ontario Ministry of Finance, 2013).

Eighty-nine percent of the province’s population lives within Census Metropolitan Areas (CMAs) or 
Census Agglomerations (CAs) (Statistics Canada, 2012). Most of the province’s future growth will 
continue to be concentrated in urban areas; therefore, Ontarians will increasingly live and work in 
denser, more transit-accessible neighborhoods. The Greater Golden Horseshoe (GGH) in Southern 
Ontario will absorb most of this growth, primarily through immigration (Ontario Ministry of Finance, 2013).

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Ontario is also home to the country’s largest population of Indigenous people, approximately 242,495 
of Canada’s 1,172,785 First Nations, Inuit, and Métis (Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development 
Canada, 2014). Indigenous populations in the central and northern sub-regions have unique 
vulnerabilities to climate-related impacts. For example, one in four First Nations communities in Ontario 
are accessible only by air year-round or ice- or winter-road seasonally.

1.3 ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS

The economies of Central and Northern Ontario are similar in many respects. While traditional economic 
activities, like mining, remain important in both sub-regions, diversification efforts are being made (Ontario 
Ministry of Infrastructure and Ministry of Northern Development, Mines and Forestry, 2011). 

Central Ontario contains the majority of the province’s 40 operational mines, representing significant 
economic opportunity (Ontario Ministry of Northern Development and Mines, 2013). Thunder Bay 
is a key transportation hub for air, rail, and marine-shipping traffic, while Sudbury’s economic base 
includes mining, resource-processing, tourism, and education. Northern Ontario’s main industries 
include mining and tourism. The province’s Growth Plan for Northern Ontario (Ontario Ministry of 
Infrastructure and Ministry of Northern Development, Mines and Forestry, 2011) covers the geographic 
range of both sub-regions, and proposes actions for further diversification (i.e. enhancing the service 
sector and increasing value-added manufacturing for raw materials destined for export).

Unlike the other two sub-regions, the economy of Southern Ontario is driven primarily by the 
service and manufacturing sectors (Hutton, 2010). Predominantly urban (albeit with many rural 
and agricultural communities on the urban fringe), the economy is influenced in part by provincial 
legislation supporting the concentration of infrastructure, jobs, and residents, as well as its proximity to 
trading partners in the United States.

Ontario’s transportation system is extensive, with all four major modes playing important roles in 
moving people and goods. Figure 2 presents a snapshot of Ontario’s transportation system, including 
principle airports, ports, roads, and rail lines. The following sections introduce and explore each mode 
in greater depth.

CHAPTER 6: ONTARIO 

145
145

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 20162.1 ROAD TRANSPORTATION

Ontario’s highway system includes over 16,600 km of provincially-managed highways, 2,756 bridges, over 1,800 
km of the TransCanada Highway system, and an extensive regional/municipal road network (Ontario Ministry of 
Northern Development and Mines, 2012). There is an extensive user base for this network, which is presented in 
Figure 3. In 2013, Ontario had over 11 million active road vehicle registrations, including 7.6 million light vehicles 
(e.g., cars, pickup trucks, and vans) and 237,000 heavy vehicles (e.g., buses and tractor-trailers); the rest of this 
figure includes trailers, motorcycles, and farm/construction vehicles (Statistics Canada, 2015a).  

The road system is an essential component of Canada’s international and interprovincial trading network. 
In 2015, trucking accounted for 68.9 percent of the value of Ontario’s trade with the United States (Transport 
Canada, adapted from Statistics Canada, International Trade database). The Ambassador Bridge border 
crossing is especially critical, accounting for 23.3 percent of cross-border truck traffic between Canada and the 
United States in 2015 (Transport Canada, 2016).

Northern and Central Ontario features more than 3,000 km of winter roads, linking remote communities to the 
provincial highway network (Federal/Provincial/Territorial Sub-Working Group on Northern Transportation, 2015). 
Ontario’s winter roads are built and maintained by 29 First Nations communities and the Town of Moosonee, 
with financial and technical assistance from provincial and federal governments. While these roads provide 
only seasonal access (typically from December to March), they are far less costly than constructing all-weather 
roads on Arctic terrain, which has been estimated at USD$85,000 (CAD$111,758) per road-km and USD$64,000-
150,000 (CAD$84,147-197,220)4 per bridge (Prowse et al, 2009; Dore and Burton, 2001).

A number of operators provide rail services in Ontario. Canadian National (CN) and Canadian Pacific 
(CP) provide freight services within the province, while CN, CP, and CSX (a US company) operate 
internationally. The most significant commodities moved by rail in Ontario include fuel, metals, 
chemicals, and manufactured products (Statistics Canada, 2015b).

VIA Rail Canada provides passenger services along the Windsor-Quebec City corridor, from Toronto to 
Vancouver, and on the Lake Superior route (White River to Sudbury), while Amtrak crosses the border 
at Niagara Falls and provides service to Toronto. While VIA operates on a 12,500 km rail network, 98 
percent of this track is owned and operated by CN, CP, and other partners (VIA Rail, 2015). Ontario 
Northland also offers freight and passenger services from Cochrane (in the central sub-region) to 
Moosonee (in the North).

Ontario’s rail network also includes: 

•  10 local and regional freight operators; 

•  11 tourist railways; 

• 

• 

Three light-rail and metro (i.e. subway) systems (Toronto, Ottawa, and Kitchener-Waterloo by 
2017); and

The GO Transit system, providing regional passenger services in Southern Ontario (Railway 
Association of Canada, 2014). 

Metrolinx, a provincial agency responsible for regional transportation planning in the Greater Toronto 
and Hamilton Area (GTHA), has been upgrading rail throughout Southern Ontario in recent years 
(Transport Canada, 2014). Notable projects include the Union-Pearson Express, Eglinton Crosstown LRT, 
and the Regional Express Rail (RER) initiative, a 10-year plan to provide faster and more frequent GO 
Transit service and electrify core segments of the rail network.

Ontario’s rail sector is relatively stable, although operational track-kilometres are declining (Statistics 
Canada, 2015b). In total, Ontario operated 16 thousand km of track for both freight and passenger 
services in 2013 – a 15.5 percent decrease from 2009 (Statistics Canada, 2015b). Other recent trends 
in Ontario’s rail sector include:  

•  Cargo originating in Ontario and destined for other provinces and international markets declined 

20 percent from 2001 to 2013 (Statistics Canada, 2015c). 

•  Goods transported by rail into Ontario from other provinces and North American jurisdictions 

declined 18 percent from 2001 to 2013 (Statistics Canada, 2015c).  

•  Passenger movements along VIA’s Ontario corridors have declined significantly in recent years, 

contributing to changes in service patterns (Transport Canada, 2015). 

• 

In contrast, ridership on the GO Transit network increased approximately 28 percent from 2007 to 
2013, representing a growing segment of Ontario’s commuter market (Metrolinx, 2014). 

2.3 MARINE TRANSPORTATION

The Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Seaway (the Seaway) is the most important stretch of navigable 
water in Canada, encompassing four Great Lakes with Ontario shoreline and the St. Lawrence River. 
Hundreds of other lakes and rivers in Ontario, particularly in the northern and central sub-regions, also 
provide shipping, tourism, recreation, and subsistence benefits.

 
CHAPTER 6: ONTARIO 

147
147

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016The Seaway is a 3,700-km managed watercourse that became fully navigable in 1959. It operates 
through a series of locks, and contains other valuable infrastructure (including harbours, and 
navigation equipment) that enables direct international trade with the United States, Europe, and 
beyond. Approximately 30,000 tonnes of freight originates in or is destined for Ontario by domestic 
waterways annually (Statistics Canada, 2010).

The Seaway has historically been a critical path for Prairie exporters shipping grain to eastern markets, 
with the most important transcontinental transfer and access point to the Great Lakes system located 
on the north shore of Lake Superior at Thunder Bay (Martin Associates, 2011). Most shipping journeys 
are significant. A typical route for marine freight running from Thunder Bay to the Port of Montreal 
is approximately 1,967 km (102 hours of sailing and 17 hours in the locks) (St. Lawrence Seaway 
Management Corporation, 2014). Important commodities transported through Ontario’s segment of 
the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Seaway include: 

•  Agricultural crops (40 percent), 

•  Mining products (40 percent), 

• 

Iron and steel products (10 percent), and 

•  “Other” goods, including forestry, animal, and petroleum products (10 percent) (Martin 

Associates, 2011).

2.4 AIR TRANSPORTATION

Air travel has been gaining importance and market share for both passenger and cargo movement 
in Ontario. In 2013, 452,000 tonnes of cargo were loaded and unloaded at Ontario’s airports (an 
increase of approximately 5,000 tonnes from 2010), and approximately 45 million passengers passed 
through Ontario terminals (see Figure 2 for principle airports).  Approximately 35 million of these 
boardings and departures occurred at Toronto’s Pearson International Airport, which is Canada’s 
busiest airport (Transport Canada, 2015). Passenger volume in the province has increased by almost 1 
million passengers annually since 2010 (Statistics Canada, 2016). 

An important influence on the evolution of aviation in Ontario was the 1987 deregulation of 
Canada’s air industry and airport divestiture program. As a result, private interests and quasi-public 
authorities are now responsible for the capital and operational demands of air infrastructure in many 
communities (for example, regional airports), although provincial and federal governments continue 
to contribute significantly to airport infrastructure and upkeep (Transport Canada, 2014). This means 
that climate adaptation efforts for air infrastructure will involve many levels of government, with a 
major role for the private sector.

This section provides a brief overview of some observed and projected changes in Ontario’s climate 
in order to convey the direction and magnitude of future changes. More detailed information is 
available from several sources, including the Ontario Centre for Climate Impacts and Adaptation 
Resources and the Ontario Climate Consortium.

3.1 OBSERVED CLIMATE TRENDS 

Throughout Ontario, mean annual surface air temperatures have increased by a range of 
approximately 1.0-1.5°C from 1948 to 2012, while central and northern regions experienced slightly 
larger increases (Vincent et al., 2015). The greatest warming has occurred in winter. Reflecting these 
warmer winters, average annual ice cover throughout the Great Lakes declined by 71 percent from 
1973 to 2012 (Kahl and Stirrat, 2012). 

Annual total precipitation also increased in Ontario from 1948 to 2012, with the most significant 
increases occurring in the North (Vincent et al., 2015). Snow cover and annual snowfall (as a 
proportion of precipitation) has decreased in all regions, with the most significant declines in the 
central and northern sub-regions (Vincent et al., 2015).

It is generally more difficult to recognize changes in extreme weather (i.e. frequency of intense wind, 
rain, and heat events) than changes in average conditions, although the relationship between 
increased air temperatures and storm intensity is well-documented (Zwiers and Kharin, 1998; Westra et 
al., 2015).  Analysis in trends of short-duration extreme rainfall for Canada (research including regional 
and provincial analysis for Ontario) shows that increasing trends are more common than decreasing 
trends, and that many increases are statistically significant (Shepherd et al., 2014). 

The Great Lakes are not considered susceptible to sea level rise, given their respective elevations 
above sea level (74 metres in the case of Lake Ontario and 183 metres for Lake Superior) coupled 
with the lakes’ outward flow to the Atlantic Ocean (see Figure 4). However, water levels in the Great 
Lakes are prone to fluctuation. Levels below long-term monthly means were witnessed from 1997 to 
2012 (Shlozberg et al, 2014); however, the cold winters of 2013 and 2014 (which featured extensive 
winter lake-ice coverage and cooler temperatures) broke this trend, with water-level increases 
in all lakes (Dorling and Hanniman, 2016; Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory, 2015). 
Regardless, the long-term impacts of climate change on water levels will not be clear for some time, 
as results of the International Upper Great Lakes Study suggest that “natural variability” in Great Lakes 
water levels may mask the effects of climate change over the next 30 years (Brown et al., 2012).

3.2 CLIMATE PROJECTIONS

Ontario’s climate is projected to change in all three sub-regions, with some variations. Projected 
changes in annual and seasonal precipitation and temperature for the province as a whole are 
shown in Table 2. Figures 5a-b and 6a-b capture sub-regional variation, presenting a gradient of 
possible changes for the years 2016-2035, 2046-2065, and 2081-2100, in relation to a baseline period of 
1986-2005.

and Climate Change Canada)

Figures 5a and 5b suggest that warming is projected to continue in all three sub-regions under all 
future scenarios, with the most drastic increases expected in Northern Ontario during winter. Projected 
precipitation changes show greater variability, with annual increases in all three sub-regions but 
seasonal (summer) decreases projected in Central and Southern Ontario under some scenarios. While 
not captured in the preceding tables and figures, average daily wind speed is projected to increase 
throughout the province (Cheng et al., 2012b).

 
CHAPTER 6: ONTARIO 

153
153

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016In Northern Ontario, snow as a proportion of winter precipitation is likely to decrease, and freezing 
rain events are expected to increase in frequency by 60-85 percent (Cheng et al., 2007). This creates 
the potential for road, rail, and runway disruptions and safety issues in Northern Ontario. Warming 
and thawing of permafrost will most affect the hydrology of peatlands and surface stability in areas 
where permafrost is currently present (Prowse et al, 2009). Areas along the coast of James Bay and 
Hudson Bay will experience earlier break-up and delayed freeze-up of sea ice, and will also continue 
to experience falling relative sea levels throughout this century and beyond, due to a phenomenon 
known as “isostatic rebound” in which land previously depressed by glaciers rises gradually (Atkinson 
et al., 2016).

Figures 6a and 6b demonstrate that under most scenarios, precipitation volumes will increase across 
the province in winter, with more areas experiencing declining precipitation in the summer. In the 
central and southern sub-regions, the intensity, duration, and frequency of some extreme weather 
events will likely increase in both summer and winter (Ontario Ministry of Transportation, 2013a; Chiotti 
and Lavender, 2008; Colombo et al., 2007; Deng et al., 2015). These events include ice storms, heat 
waves, freezing rain (increasing 40 percent), and intense rainfall (Reid et al, 2007; Cheng et al., 2007). 
While annual snowfall volumes will likely decline under warmer winter conditions in the next few 
decades, winter storms may increase in intensity (although decrease in frequency), yielding heavy 
accumulations of snowfall in singular storm events (Auld et al., 2006). Research focused specifically on 
Toronto also suggests that while the season in which  freeze-thaw events occur (where temperatures 
fluctuate above and below freezing in a short period of time) may contract, there is likely to be 
significantly more “freeze-thaw activity” during winter months (Ho and Gough, 2006; Federal Highway 
Administration, 2015).

2012). Warmer temperatures over the 21st century will likely be associated with a continued decrease 
in winter ice cover on the Great Lakes, consistent with observed trends (Kahl and Stirrat, 2012), and 
an increase in lake-effect snow in some locations. Increased temperatures (and evaporation) and 
a longer ice-free season could lead to water-level decreases of 0.5-1 m in the Great Lakes and St. 
Lawrence River by 2055 (Shlozberg et al, 2014; Brown et al., 2012). However, long-term future trends 
toward lower water levels may be overestimated due to the limitations of traditional modeling 
efforts (MacKay and Seglenieks, 2013). As of February 2015, water levels in Lake Ontario and the St. 
Lawrence Seaway were 20 cm below monthly historical averages (International St. Lawrence River 
Board of Control, 2015).

4.0 ROAD TRANSPORTATION IN ONTARIO 

4.1 PAST IMPACTS

Historical examples of climate impacts to transportation networks, particularly extreme weather 
events, can affect public and political perceptions of risk and the likelihood of adaptation 
action. Major events that have affected transportation in Ontario include Hurricane Hazel in 1954 
(Environment Canada, 2013b; see Chapter 9) and the North American Ice Storm of 1998. During the 
latter event, ice accumulation on electrical infrastructure, roadways, and rail lines caused significant 
damage and disruption, shut down transportation and signalization networks, and stranded travelers 
(Environment Canada, 2013b). 

In December 2013, another severe winter weather event caused road obstructions throughout 
Southern and Central Ontario, due to fallen branches, transmission lines, and heavy ice. The City of 
Toronto (2014) estimates its municipal agencies incurred costs and lost revenue of approximately $106 
million as a result of the storm. A number of important adaptive practices were identified following this 
event, including the need to:

• 

Improve information-sharing between provincial and municipal governments; 

•  Enhance coordination between emergency personnel and the infrastructure sector;

•  Provide backup power for traffic signals; and 

•  Update Ontario’s emergency response plan (Office of the Fire Marshal and Emergency 

Management, 2014).

Recent extreme summer storm events have also caused widespread disruption and damage. In 
2002, Northwestern Ontario was struck by intense rain, resulting in $31 million in estimated damages to 
highways, as well as lengthy closures to TransCanada highways (Chiotti and Lavender, 2008). Damage 
would likely have been more severe had this storm occurred in a more urbanized area.  

The impacts of these events on connectivity are greater for regions dependent on roads and 
highways with few alternate routes for mobility (such as in Central and Northern Ontario). Washouts 
from extreme weather events have stranded travelers for extended periods of time in some cases, 
affecting economic flows and delaying emergency-response personnel.

EXTREME AND CHANGING PRECIPITATION

Research suggests Southern Ontario is likely to experience more frequent and severe extreme 
weather events by late-century (Cheng et al., 2012a). Past impacts of heavy or prolonged 
precipitation, including flooding and bridge scour in summer, and icy roadways and fallen power lines 
in winter, have been disruptive to Ontario’s roads, bridges, and supporting infrastructure, and similar 
occurrences pose future risks. 

Changing patterns of precipitation will also likely affect Ontario’s roads. The province can expect 
more instances of flooding and washouts as rainstorm frequency increases, which pose safety risks 
(Boyle et al., 2013). Vehicle accidents are up to 45 percent more likely during severe precipitation 
events (Andrey et al., 2003). Additionally, freezing rain (as a proportion of winter precipitation) is likely 
to increase throughout the province (Bruce, 2011; Cheng et al., 2011), creating safety and winter road 
maintenance challenges (i.e. increased salt and sand requirements).

RISING TEMPERATURES AND EXTREME HEAT

Rising annual temperatures and more frequent extreme heat events have increased instances of 
pavement softening, rutting, flushing, and bleeding in Southern Ontario in the past (Mills et al., 2009; 
Woudsma et al., 2007). These impacts are likely to be exacerbated in the future considering projected 
temperature trends (see Section 3). High temperatures causing thermal expansion of bridge joints 
(“blow-ups”) have also resulted in bridge closures and detours in some jurisdictions (Transportation 
Research Board, 2008), although the risk of this impact remains low in Ontario.

Warmer winter temperatures and more short-term (i.e. daily) temperature variability are likely to 
produce more freeze-thaw cycles throughout the province, resulting in pavement deformation 
and shearing (Boyle et al., 2013; Ho and Gough, 2006). Resulting road damage could interrupt 
economically important transportation activities, such as heavy-lift/special project cargo movement, 
logging, and mining, affecting rural communities in Central and Northern Ontario.

Research suggests that while the impacts of climate change on pavement may be modest overall 
in Southern Ontario, changing conditions should be considered when selecting highway pavement 
materials (Tighe et al., 2008). For low-volume roads, research indicates that longitudinal cracking 
and rutting of pavement will worsen as a result of freeze-thaw cycles and extreme heat in the South, 
while transverse cracking will become less problematic (Mills et al., 2009). Roads will generally require 
maintenance earlier in their life spans.

Higher temperatures are likely to shorten operating seasons for winter roads in Central and Northern 
Ontario. For instance, Deloitte (2014) projects that operating windows for winter roads serving 
Ontario’s central and northern First Nations’ communities will decline 12 to 20 percent by 2050 from 
present conditions, and 20 to 40 percent by 2100. Potential socioeconomic consequences include: 

•  A shorter seasonal window for the movement of freight and people (Deloitte, 2014); 

•  Higher maintenance costs (Boyle et al., 2013; Transportation Association of Canada, 2010);

•  Reduced load capacity (due to decreased ice thickness) (Prowse et al, 2009); and, 

•  Road embankment failure (Transportation Association of Canada, 2010; Transportation Association 

of Canada, 2011).

 
CHAPTER 6: ONTARIO 

157
157

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Warmer temperatures also provide some opportunities for Ontario’s roads, including:

•  Greater fuel efficiency for many vehicles in warmer winters (Maoh et al., 2008); 

•  Longer construction seasons (Andrey and Mills, 2003); and,

•  Reduced winter maintenance requirements (Fu et al., 2009).  

CHANGING WATER LEVELS AND ICE PATTERNS

Fluctuating water levels and changing ice patterns in rivers and lakes may also result in roadway 
flooding. In Ontario, this risk is highest during spring river-ice breakup (Andrey and Mills, 2003). Seiche 
events (referring to temporary changes in lake levels caused by fluctuating atmospheric pressure) 
also present flood risks throughout the Great Lakes basin for roads adjacent to bodies of water. More 
frequent Seiche floods may affect set-back requirements for roads and other critical infrastructure in 
vulnerable areas over the long term (International Joint Commission, 2014a).

WIND

Wind speeds throughout the province are projected to increase in coming years (Cheng et al., 2012b; 
Environment Canada, 2014), presenting risks to road transport. Strong winds disperse chemical road 
treatments; produce drifting snow that reduces visibility, stability, and maneuverability; and damage 
signals and other tall structures (OFCM, 2002).

4.3 ADAPTATION PRACTICES

PRECIPITATION AND FLOODING 

Several practices identified in the literature may reduce the impacts of extreme precipitation on 
Ontario’s roads. These include using alternative routes; conducting risk assessments for new road 
infrastructure; widening culverts and making other drainage improvements; and conducting more 
frequent maintenance (Savonis et al., 2008). Some of these practices have been adopted in Ontario: 
for instance, Toronto has increased regular monitoring and clearing of blocked drainage culverts to 
address the increased flow of debris (City of Toronto, 2015). The Ontario Ministry of Transportation (MTO) 
has also undertaken research to update Ontario’s intensity, duration, and frequency (IDF) curves to 
more accurately characterize precipitation in the province, and has assessed the vulnerability of 
Ontario’s highway drainage infrastructure to more severe precipitation events (see Case study 1).

Efficient management and use of de-icing materials (including salt, sand, and brine) reduces the 
impacts (and associated costs) of freezing rain. For instance, York Region treats rock salt with beet 
juice to increase its melting capabilities, yielding budget savings of approximately 8 percent annually 
(Clean Air Partnership, 2012). 

Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) can also support adaptation on an operational level. Variable 
message signs can warn motorists of roadway safety concerns in real time to prevent accidents 
during precipitation events (Andrey and Mills, 2003). Similarly, Ontario’s Road Weather Information 
System (RWIS) (deployed in the 1990s) provides MTO and its contractors with real-time environmental 
information to inform responsive winter highway maintenance practices (Buchanan and Gwartz, 2005).

CHANGING WATER LEVELS AND ICE PATTERNS (FLOOD RISKS)

In areas particularly vulnerable to flooding, road infrastructure can be relocated or elevated to 
reduce risks (Savonis et al., 2008). However, elevating roads is costly, and relocation may raise 
issues related to land expropriation. Therefore, it is often more prudent to enhance the capacity of 
stormwater management and other flood-prevention infrastructure, such as breakwaters or dykes 
(Andrey and Mills, 2003). 

 
CHAPTER 6: ONTARIO 

158
158

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016WIND

To reduce the impacts of wind, structures can be designed to withstand more turbulent conditions 
(OFCM, 2002). In some rural Ontario communities, living “snow fences” (rows of trees lining open tracts 
of farmland) have been used to reduce soil loss due to intense wind; however, they also provide 
co-benefits for transportation by reducing the impacts of blowing snow on roadway visibility in winter 
(Huron County, 2014). 

EXTREME HEAT AND RISING TEMPERATURES

Some parts of the province, including the City of Toronto, use heat-tolerant pavement mixtures 
to enhance roadway heat-resiliency (Andrey and Mills, 2003; City of Toronto, 2011). The Ontario 
Ministry of Transportation (MTO) and some Ontario municipalities have also used an asphalt materials 
characterization system called “SuperPave” since 1997. This system was designed to improve long-
term pavement performance (reducing rutting and cracking) under diverse environmental conditions 
(Ontario Ministry of Transportation, 2013b). The SuperPave system considers high- and low-temperature 
performance for pavement lifecycles, using detailed weather station data to determine appropriate 
asphalt mixes for specific locations. While the system does not include projected climate parameters, 
MTO is implementing an enhanced “mechanistic-empirical” pavement design method for some 
projects, taking into account pavement performance predictions, detailed weather station data, and 
traffic levels.  The MTO believes this will facilitate the use of road materials and designs that are more 
responsive to changing climate conditions (Ontario Ministry of Transportation, 2013b).  

Finally, reduced seasonal operating seasons for winter roads in Ontario, resulting from warmer 
temperatures, could require a shift to other modes of transportation (e.g., air) for some shipments, 
given the prohibitive cost of replacing Ontario’s winter roads with all-weather infrastructure (estimated 
at approximately $1.5 billion) (Deloitte, 2014). Changes to shipment-scheduling and resource 
exploration activities have also been proposed as adaptations, along with specific operational 
and maintenance practices (see Chapter 3 for more detail on these practices) (Prowse et al., 2009; 
Transportation Association of Canada, 2011).

Table 3 provides an overview of the impacts and adaptations identified in this section.

CASE STUDY 1:  ASSESSING THE RESILIENCE OF HIGHWAY 
DRAINAGE INFRASTRUCTURE AT THE ONTARIO MINISTRY OF 
TRANSPORTATION 

There are concerns that an increase in the severity of precipitation events may threaten the future design 
capacity of Ontario’s highway drainage infrastructure. The Ontario Ministry of Transportation (MTO) 
undertook two interrelated research initiatives to assess this vulnerability and determine appropriate 
adaptation strategies.  

PROJECT 1:  UPDATING INTENSITY, DURATION, AND FREQUENCY (IDF) CURVES FOR 
ONTARIO

This project aimed to update Ontario’s intensity, duration, and frequency (IDF) curves to more accurately 
characterize precipitation in the province. 

In partnership with the University of Waterloo, researchers developed IDF curves for all locations in the 
province. These curves use Environment and Climate Change Canada’s most recent historical climate 
data, and are available via an easy-to-use online platform.5 The MTO continues to partner with the 
University of Waterloo to identify trends in the historical rainfall record, which can provide an alternative 
method of developing future scenarios.

PROJECT 2:  ASSESSING HIGHWAY DRAINAGE AND STORMWATER MANAGEMENT 
INFRASTRUCTURE

This project assessed the resilience of existing highway drainage infrastructure to future precipitation loads, 
and identified adaptation strategies for a variety of infrastructure components, over their design life.  

Researchers sampled two sections of provincial highway, representing different levels of use (Highway 37 
near Belleville and Highway 417 near Ottawa). They analyzed the capacity of 25 pipe runs in each section, 
as well as 46 culverts. The project had three key stages.  

Stage 1:  Identifying reliable (i.e. likely) precipitation projections under future climate conditions. Based on 
a review of climate studies in Ontario, and analysis of data, the researchers determined that projected 
precipitation intensity varies across the province. Accordingly, the researchers considered three climate 
change scenarios feasible for the infrastructure resilience analysis: 10-, 20-, and 30-percent increases in 
rainfall intensity. (Note that horizons for change were not defined in this study.) 

Stage 2: Assessing design capacities of sewers and culverts. This stage identified the proportion of existing 
infrastructure that will meet future capacity requirements based on the three precipitation scenarios – that 
is, the proportion of infrastructure with “hydraulic resilience.” While researchers identified minor impacts on 
sewers for the two sample highway networks, most infrastructure was deemed to possess sufficient capacity 
for future conditions.

Stage 3:  Identifying adaptation measures to alleviate potential drainage issues. This stage required 
researchers to match adaptations to the risks identified. It was determined that where an increase in the 
flow velocity presents erosion risks to culverts, more erosion-resistant materials can be used to protect 
drainage structures. If headwater elevation is a concern, the chosen adaptation will depend on severity.  
In general, MTO does not allow drainage designs which permit overtopping (i.e. flooding) on Ontario 
highways; however, if overtopping is unavoidable, twinning existing sewers and culverts to increase 
capacity is useful.  

Bridges are typically designed with limited excess drainage capacity, due to the greater expense of these 
structures. However, this study determined that precipitation increases up to 30 percent do not pose a 
threat to bridges. If bridge scour or erosion is likely, physical protection can be provided.

SUMMARY

Overall, the results of this study are good news for Ontario highways. It was concluded that MTO’s existing 
design standards for highways are resilient to overtopping within the projected range of precipitation, and 
increases pose no serious risks to road safety. Specifically, 40 per cent of the pipes demonstrating excess 
capacity were sized to meet regulatory minimums, rather than to deal with expected rainfall levels. Thus, 
no infrastructure should need replacing before the end of its lifecycle to account for rainfall increases.

This analysis was limited to possible climate change impacts on the rainfall intensities used in design. Areas 
that could be considered in future include the impacts of increasing precipitation intensity and duration on 
foundational materials, and changes to the classification of “regulatory storms” in Ontario (as defined by 
the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry).

Despite these findings, many roads throughout the province remain vulnerable to flood events, including 
rare occurrences that exceed design capacity. The impact of such disruptions to roads may be reduced 
via redundancies in the road network (i.e. alternative routes on nearby municipal roads). (See Chapter 9.)

5.0 RAIL TRANSPORTATION IN ONTARIO

5.1 PAST IMPACTS

Examples of past climate events resulting in impacts on rail transportation include: 

•  A July 5-17, 1936 heat wave, exceeding 44˚C in parts of Manitoba and Ontario, resulted in steel 

rail lines buckling, and bridge girders twisting (Environment Canada, 2013a).  

•  A December 1942 freezing rain storm in Eastern Ontario coated telephone wires, trees, and 

railway tracks with thick ice, forcing 50,000 workers in Ottawa to walk to work for five days 
(Environment Canada, 2013a).

•  Hurricane Hazel (1954) caused considerable damage and disruption to rail transportation 

throughout Southern Ontario (Environment Canada, 2013b).

• 

The 1998 North American Ice Storm disrupted rail service within and between major cities 
(Environment Canada, 2013a).

•  Severe rain events in 2013 in Toronto flooded rail lines in the Don Valley and in one case stranded 

GO Transit passengers (CBC News, 2013).

5.2 FUTURE RISKS

Rail transportation faces a variety of unique risks due to changing climate conditions and more 
extreme weather. Changes to the range of experienced temperatures present challenges for the 
integrity of rails – this risk is particularly pronounced in Southern Ontario where extreme temperatures 
will be highest. For example, buckling may occur in extreme heat, increasing travel times (as a result 
of slower train speeds) and enhancing the potential for derailment, track-sensor malfunction, and 
hazardous-material spills (OFCM, 2002). High temperatures also result in overheated cargo (Andrey 
and Mills, 2003). In the North, permafrost thaw weakens rail embankments (Caldwell et al., 2002); in 
combination with heavy precipitation, washouts and embankment failure may increase in Northern

162

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Ontario (Transportation Association of Canada, 2010). However, warmer winters could reduce cold-
weather rail maintenance for Ontario’s railways (Andrey et al, 2003).

Wind also poses risks to rail transportation, such as more schedule disruptions and delays; hazardous 
material spills; railcar blow-over (albeit only during extremely rare events); and disruptions and 
damage to signalization equipment (OFCM, 2002). Given increasing daily average wind speeds 
throughout the province (see Section 3), these risks may increase in the 21st century.

More frequent and intense rainfall events may flood rail track, create service disruptions and delays, 
and reduce on-time performance (Woudsma et al, 2007; OFCM 2002; Koatse and Rietveld, 2012). 
Rail lines near watercourses are vulnerable to flooding associated with changing water levels and 
changing patterns of lake ice (Koatse and Rietveld, 2012). 

5.3 ADAPTATION PRACTICES

A number of practices to reduce rail vulnerabilities exist in the literature. In the case of extreme heat 
and rail buckling, approaches include imposing speed restrictions, reducing service frequency, and 
conducting more frequent track inspections (Savonis et al., 2008). Cargo cooling and refrigeration 
may reduce product loss and damage for freight carriers (Andrey and Mills, 2003). Researchers have 
also reported reductions in peak rail temperature by using low-solar absorption rail coatings in sunny 
conditions (Wang et al., 2015). GO Transit has changed its engineering practices to reduce the 
vulnerability of its rail to extreme heat (Case study 2).

To reduce infrastructure flooding near watercourses, approaches in the literature include: improving 
flow management processes, constructing dikes, along with other flood-prevention engineering 
solutions (Savonis et al, 2008), and elevating track segments (Koatse and Rietveld, 2012). During 
extreme precipitation events, rail providers may reduce service frequency and increase the timeliness 
of travel and service advisories (Savonis et al., 2008). Operations can also be modified for forecasted 
conditions (OFCM, 2002). For example, following various extreme events in the Greater Toronto 
Area, Metrolinx and GO Transit undertook a number of adaptive measures to enhance rail-corridor 
resiliency, including:

•  Flood-prevention efforts in the Don Valley, installing rail embankment-failure and high-water 

detectors; 

•  Service-planning for extreme winter weather (which involves running fewer trains, but reduces the 

likelihood of delays or cancellations, to ensure business continuity in snowy conditions); and 

• 

The installation of emergency electricity backup at their rail maintenance facility.

CASE STUDY 2: PREPARING FOR HIGHER TEMPERATURES AND 
RAIL BUCKLING AT GO TRANSIT

Metrolinx is a provincial agency responsible for public transportation in the Greater Toronto and 
Hamilton Area (GTHA). Its authority extends to capital investments, strategic decision-making, and 
operational planning for GO Transit (Canada’s highest-volume commuter rail and bus service), as well 
as improving, coordinating, and integrating these services with municipal transit and other modes. 
Metrolinx and GO Transit have begun to broadly identify threats to the organisation posed by changes 
in climate and extreme weather events, and to assess vulnerabilities and risks to facilities, practices, 
and protocols. A corporate climate adaptation policy is also being developed, due to be completed 
in 2018 (Metrolinx, 2015).

In the near-term, the organisation is responding to the most immediate climate-related concerns with 
available resources and expertise. These “low-hanging fruit” mainly fall under the operational umbrella, 
since disruptions to front-line services and road and rail infrastructure pose risks to the quantity and quality 
of commuter service Metrolinx is able to provide. 

For instance, the Railway Corridors division of GO Transit is preparing for the extreme summer temperatures 
projected for Southern Ontario by the middle of the 21st century. There is a tendency for rail lines to expand 
and “buckle” in temperatures exceeding 27˚C, which poses risks to operating speed, safety, and line 
capacity. Minor buckling has been observed along select network segments on hot summer days over 
the past 10 years. GO engineers have opted to proactively lessen buckling risks to rail lines and service by 
increasing the preferred rail-laying and rail-distressing temperatures for Southern Ontario from 32.2˚C to 
37.8˚C (90 to 100 degrees Fahrenheit). This simple adaptation involves no extra cost – only minor equipment 
adjustments – yet it has yielded maintenance benefits. Rail buckling has decreased significantly in affected 
areas since this change was made. While no organisational standards have been changed (largely due to 
the time and resources required) the practice has been adopted beyond Railway Corridors. For instance, 
GO Transit is using this higher rail-laying and rail-distressing temperature in the construction of the Union-
Pearson Express. This represents an example of a “no-regret” adaptation strategy, referring to actions 
involving few additional costs, produce co-benefits, or prevent future damage and costs (see Chapter 9). 

Practitioners also suggest that updated rail-laying and -distressing temperatures have not significantly 
affected the tolerance of GO rail infrastructure to colder temperatures. While extreme cold has caused 
rail contraction in more northern jurisdictions, GO Transit rail lines have not been significantly affected. 
Practitioners do not expect rail contraction in winter to be as much of a problem in coming decades, given 
that on average, Southern Ontario is expected to experience warmer winters in the 21st century.

delays and cancellations at airports in Ontario. Events affecting one airport can also have a ripple 
effect, disrupting air travel in other parts of Canada and North America.  

For example, from January 5 to 9, 2014, an unusual combination of rain, snow, snow squalls, and wind 
chills/extreme cold in Eastern Ontario and other parts of Canada severely disrupted passenger travel 
at many airports, including Toronto Pearson International. Extreme cold (reaching -39°C with wind 
chill) and ice build-up slowed ground crews and caused some equipment (e.g., fueling) to fail or 
operate intermittently. The sudden drop in temperature also caused snow and slush, from earlier rain, 
on taxiways, apron, and gate areas to freeze. Temperatures were too cold for chemical treatments 
to effectively melt the ice and snow. These operational impacts in tandem with other factors (such 
as the airport receiving high numbers of diverted flights from other airports), created delays and 
disruptions in passenger travel throughout Canada. In response to this event, the Greater Toronto 
Airports Authority (GTAA) reviewed and developed recommendations on the airport’s operations, 
customer service, and communications (GTAA, 2014a).

6.2 FUTURE RISKS

Literature suggests air transportation is affected by a changing climate and extreme weather in 
several ways. The following climate risks are relevant to airports and aviation in Ontario.

•  More variable temperatures increase the risk of ice build-up on wings (GTAA, 2014b).  

•  Warmer conditions result in decreased air density, which provides less lift for aircraft. This can 

increase requirements for fuel and runway length (Andrey and Mills, 2003). 

• 

Increased freeze-thaw cycles can cause runway buckling (Transportation Research Board, 2008). 

•  Extreme cold and heat can affect airplane engines and airport operations, resulting in service 

delays and reduced on-time performance (OFCM, 2002; Woudsma et al, 2007). 

• 

Thawing permafrost poses a risk to the stability of runways in northern communities dependent 
upon aviation (Transportation Association of Canada, 2010).

•  Flood-prone areas face an increased risk of runway flooding associated with extreme precipitation 

events and seasonal changes in water levels (Andrey and Mills, 2003; ICAO Secretariat, 2010). 

•  Greater wind intensity (both daily and during extreme events) increase incidences of foreign 

objects on runways, taxiways, and maintenance facilities, and impede maintenance of airplanes 
(especially high on the body, including snow removal and de-icing procedures) (OFCM, 2002). 

•  Warming temperatures will also lead to more “mixed” precipitation events (for instance, freezing 

rain combined with snow and rain) during winter operations (GTAA, 2014b). 

Airports are also affected by weather events in other areas, since flights may need to be grounded or 
rerouted, further straining infrastructure and operations.

While air operators in Ontario are already applying some adaptive practices, others could be applied 
under future conditions. For example, remote airports in Northern Ontario have long used portable 
forced air heaters to combat ice build-up on aircraft (Transport Canada, 2004). To cope with a 
projected increase in extreme winter weather and freezing rain events, operators could also adopt 
changes to engine and wing de-icing procedures in future. This could include a greater use of glycol-
based de-icing and anti-icing agents (Transportation Research Board, 2011).  

Increasing average temperatures over the long term may also offer benefits to Ontario operators, 
such as by reducing de-icing requirements in southern locations (Andrey and Mills, 2003). As 
temperatures increase, however, airports may use more heat-resistant pavement materials for 
runway construction (similar to asphalt roads) (Andrey and Mills, 2003). Over the longer term, future 
temperatures may need to be considered when determining runway length requirements. 

To enhance the braking and handling ability of aircraft on wet surfaces during periods of heavy 
precipitation, Ottawa International Airport grooved one of its runways in the summer of 2013. 
Grooving minimizes the potential for hydroplaning when landing, and construction is relatively non-
disruptive. (The runway remained in use during the day while construction was completed over ten 
nights).  After a year of operating on this new surface, pilots reported improved control.  The airport 
then moved forward with plans to groove its longest runway in the summer of 2015 (Schwanz, 2014).  

Runways experiencing issues associated with permafrost thaw are common in Northern Canada 
(Transportation Association of Canada, 2010) (see Chapter 3), although these issues were not 
identified in literature specific to Ontario.  Should permafrost issues arise in future, relevant adaptations 
include relocating damaged or unusable infrastructure or reconstruction with geosynthetic barriers to 
enhance stability (Savonis et al., 2008; Transportation Association of Canada, 2010). Thermosyphons – 
mechanical systems designed to transfer heat from the ground away from infrastructure – also reduce 
the impacts of thawing permafrost on runways, although the installation costs may be prohibitive for 
small airports (Transportation Association of Canada, 2010).

CASE STUDY 3: ASSESSING THE VULNERABILITY OF 
STORMWATER MANAGEMENT INFRASTRUCTURE AT PEARSON 
INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT

In 2012, the Greater Toronto Airports Authority (GTAA) assessed the vulnerability of selected stormwater 
infrastructure at Toronto Pearson International Airport to climate change, using Engineers Canada’s Public 
Infrastructure Engineering Vulnerability Committee’s (PIEVC) Climate Vulnerability Assessment process. 
The assessment was chiefly motivated by potential threats to infrastructure under future conditions.  These 
include: 

• 

Flooding of runways, taxiways, and manoeuvring areas; 

•  Wind damage to terminals and navigational equipment; 

• 

Stormwater runoff exceeding drainage capacity; 

•  Disruption of operations and ground access; and 

•  Changing requirements for plane de-icing and snow removal. 

The PIEVC protocol gives infrastructure operators a method to assess the vulnerability of their assets in 
relation to historic, recent, and projected climate parameters. It operates in five stages. 

Stage 1 involves project definition. The GTAA chose to focus on selected stormwater infrastructure and the 
Spring Creek Triple Box Culvert (see Figure 7). The GTAA selected a total of 27 climate variables for impact 
assessment, including temperature fluctuations, precipitation intensity, duration, and frequency, freeze-
thaw cycles, fog, wind, and major storm events, among others (GTAA, 2014b). Stage 2 involved collecting 
historical climate data for these variables. 

Stage 3 assessed risk. GTAA staff determined risk scores by multiplying the probability of an impact by 
its severity. According to this assessment, the risk-probabilities of 90 per cent of climate-infrastructure 
interactions did not increase from current to projected climate conditions. GTAA staff also analyzed 11,640 
climate-infrastructure interactions, and 27 per cent scored high enough to merit further technical inquiry.

Pearson Airport. (Source: Toronto Pearson - Spring 
Creek Culvert, 2010 - Photo taken by Morrison 
Hershfield Limited and provided courtesy of the 
Greater Toronto Airport Authority)

…

In Stage 4, the engineering analysis, staff calculated 
the relationship between current and future climate 
stress levels and the capacity of stormwater 
infrastructure. Seven vulnerable interactions were 
identified, related primarily to heavy, extreme-
heavy, and prolonged rainfall events (see GTAA, 
2014b for definitions of these events).

Stage 5 identified recommended actions. These 
included reviewing existing GTAA emergency plans 
for rain, snow, ice, and high winds; emergency 
planning for low-probability, high-impact events 
(e.g., hurricanes and tornadoes); ensuring regular 
inspection and maintenance of stormwater facilities 
(despite a generally positive prognosis); and revisiting 
climate data frequently (i.e. new IPCC scenarios). 

Since most assessed facilities were open ponds or 
very large structures, the analysis concluded that 
slight temperature and precipitation increases 
by mid-century (seasonally, annually, and in the 
frequency and intensity of extremes) will not likely 
produce serious and specific infrastructure impacts.

The PIEVC application suggests that under higher-temperature future conditions, there is a lower 
likelihood of extreme cold events. However, the probability of high-intensity rainfall events will be greater. 
During the process, staff became familiar with both extremes – July 2013 brought extreme rain, while 
December 2013 and January 2014 brought heavy snowfall, significant ice accumulation, and cold 
temperatures to the region.

GTAA staff suggested that the PIEVC process was useful in identifying both threats and opportunities for 
airport operations. As a bond-issuing entity, the GTAA has a responsibility to make investors aware of issues 
that might affect investment decisions, including climate risks. Challenges the GTAA faced when applying 
the PIEVC protocol included:

•  Maintaining consistency and continuity in staff responsible for carrying out the assessment; 

• 

• 

Time- and cost-overruns of approximately 30 percent due to reorganization. 

Ensuring organization-wide buy-in. 

Staff suggested that while baseline climate data were somewhat outdated (only historical data for the 
period 1971-2000 was available; climate normals from 1981-2010 had not yet been released), there was a 
consensus that more recent data would have shifted trends included in the vulnerability assessment only 
incrementally.

Overall, the GTAA’s PIEVC assessment has raised awareness and understanding of climate risks among 
operators and shareholders alike. Since the project assessed only $90 million of Pearson’s $6-7 billion in 
assets, the organization is now developing a streamlined process based on the PIEVC model to apply to 
other infrastructure more rapidly, at a lower cost, and at an appropriate level of detail.

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 20167.0 MARINE TRANSPORTATION IN ONTARIO

7.1 PAST IMPACTS

There are several instances of extreme weather and climate affecting marine operations in Ontario. 
For example, during the Great Lakes Storm of 1913 (November 7-13), two converging storm fronts 
created snow squalls and winds of approximately 145 km/h, sinking 34 ships and killing 270 people 
(Environment Canada, 2013a). The damage, which most affected Lakes Huron, Erie and Ontario, 
was estimated at $5 million ($119.3 million in 2015 dollars) (Brown, 2002). The nature of Great Lakes 
navigation during this period increased the risk of ships capsizing, as boats were constructed with 
the narrow width of the St. Lawrence Seaway and the shallow depth of many Great Lakes tributaries 
in mind (Catton, 1984). The storm catalyzed boat-hatch and other safety requirements, and ship-
to-shore communication technology has since improved significantly, helping to prevent casualties 
during high-intensity events (Catton, 1984). 

Low water levels in the Great Lakes have also negatively affected shippers in the past. In 1964, lower-
than-normal water levels damaged harbor infrastructure, requiring $843 million in repairs (in 1988 
dollars, or $1.49 billion in 2015 dollars) (Shlozberg et al., 2014). 

7.2 FUTURE RISKS

Throughout the 21st century, the Great Lakes will likely experience significant annual warming, greater 
evaporation, a longer ice-free season, and changing precipitation patterns. These changes will 
likely affect water levels (see Section 3). For shippers, fluctuating water levels in recent years have 
affected vessel draft capacities and annual shipping volumes throughout the Great Lakes system. 
A continuation of this trend would reduce the loads ships can carry (or produce greater variation in 
seasonal shipping capacity), increase costs, lead to more frequent shipping-schedule disruptions, 
and reduce shoreline access (Boyle et al., 2013; Shlozberg et al, 2014). Economic losses would be 
significant. Recent analysis suggests the regional economy would suffer impacts of approximately 
$1.18 billion by 2030 and $1.92 billion by 2050 as a result of reduced shipping productivity in low-water 
conditions (Shlozberg et al, 2014). While low water levels are not unprecedented – the 1960s also 
featured below-average levels in many lakes (Dorling and Hanniman, 2016) – the potential for far-
reaching economic impacts make this a key concern for Ontario’s economy. 

Fluctuations in water levels also affect infrastructure stability, requiring additional dredging of harbour 
navigational channels and interior facility slips. Such measures carry significant environmental 
implications. Low water levels can also cause infrastructure decay, as wooden structural elements 
become increasingly exposed to oxygen (Clark, 2012). Ontario has experienced these issues: low water 
levels in 2013 caused problems at docks in Tobermory and South Baymouth on Georgian Bay, when 
ferries sat too low for the fenders (designed to prevent vessels from damaging wharves). Ferry services 
could not begin as scheduled until these fenders were modified (The Manitoulin Expositor, 2013). 

Other risks to marine transportation identified in the literature include flash-flooding of inland 
waterways as a result of extreme precipitation and overland flow from ice-jams (Andrey and Mills, 
2003). High winds during storms also make ship handling more difficult, and ice build-up on structures 
from more freezing rain and extreme weather events may increase ice-scour damage on dock 
structures and visual navigational aids during winter (OFCM, 2002). 

Practitioners also suggest that “seasonal shift” of the navigable period is another important issue 
for shippers in the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Seaway, pushing traditional construction and 
maintenance schedules out of alignment with operational demands. For instance, extended or year-
round shipping in the Great Lakes would shorten or eliminate the “lay-up” period for operators in the 
Great Lakes, when fleet maintenance and preparation typically occurs.

 
CHAPTER 6: ONTARIO 

170
170

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Seiche impacts (which result from temporary changes in lake levels caused by fluctuating 
atmospheric pressure) also pose significant risks to marine infrastructure and operations in the Great 
Lakes. For instance, a recent Seiche event in Lake Michigan changed water levels by more than 3 
metres in under an hour, leaving marinas completely dry before flooding them suddenly, destroying 
vessels and infrastructure (International Joint Commission, 2014a). 

The changing climate also creates opportunities for the marine transportation sector. These include: 

•  A longer float plane season in some areas of the province (Andrey and Mills, 2003) (most notably 

the central and northern sub-regions in Ontario); 

•  A longer spring and summer shipping season; 

•  Less ice accumulation on vessels and rigging (Transportation Research Board, 2008); and, 

•  Possible new shipping routes (including the potential opening of shipping routes through the 

Arctic, although these face limitations – see Section 2.4) (Prowse et al, 2009).

7.3 ADAPTATION PRACTICES

A number of adaptations for marine transportation are identified in the literature. In cases where lower 
water levels affect navigability, shippers may shift freight to road or rail (Savonis et al., 2008). Other 
responses to lower inland water levels include changing navigation procedures; investing in flow 
augmentation technologies; and increasing dredging of channels (Andrey and Mills, 2003). The St. 
Lawrence Seaway Management Corporation (SLSMC) is taking an adaptive management approach 
to changes in climate, which includes monitoring water levels and ice patterns (see Case study 4).  
Commercial shippers operating in the Great Lakes also possess a degree of adaptive capacity and 
flexibility; operators take water levels into account when loading vessels, typically three to four weeks 
before arriving in Canadian waters (for international transits). 

A cost-benefit analysis of flow-regulation alternatives for portions of the St. Lawrence Seaway 
found that the most cost-effective solution involves constructing a series of sills, or speed bump-
like structures, in the Upper St. Clair River that would reduce the speed at which the river flows. This 
would yield net economic benefits upwards of $250 million (Dorling and Hanniman, 2016). Plan 2014, 
a flow-management plan for Lake Ontario and the Seaway developed by the International Joint 
Commission (2014b), aims to reduce damages for property owners, including ports and harbours by 
controlling the possible range of water levels. Largely, these planning initiatives attempt to reduce the 
risks associated with uncertain future water levels (International Joint Commission, 2014b; Dorling and 
Hanniman, 2016).

E-Navigation (electronic navigation) refers to modern navigation technologies and services that may 
help operators adapt to periods of lower water levels in Ontario. Potential improvements to these 
systems include establishing internet connections to provide basic ship-to-shore communication 
channels along navigable waterways. Modern “under-keel optimization systems” have also been 
implemented in some locations between Quebec City and Montreal along the St. Lawrence Seaway 
(Canadian Coast Guard, 2015), allowing operators to adjust speed (and draft) in order to pass 
through constrained channels, better managing the risks of fluctuating water levels (Galor, 2007). 
This system has also been proposed for parts of the Seaway passing through Ontario, including the St 
Clair-Detroit River, and the St. Mary’s River. 

Addressing the possibility of ice-jam flooding during early spring thaws, may require more frequent use 
of ice-breaking vessels. Practitioners in Ontario suggest that the past two winters have demonstrated 
the need to account for increased hours of operation for these vessels. For ports at risk of flooding 
(such as in those on the Great Lakes vulnerable to Seiche events), investments in some flood-proofing 
infrastructure (i.e. breakwaters and dikes) may be prudent (Savonis et al., 2008).

impact may be reduced by using ice curtains (which restrict ice moving into locks) and air bubblers 
(including compressors and fuel). However, as ice cover decreases throughout the 21st century, issues 
posed by ice breakup should become less problematic for operators.

CASE STUDY 4: WATER LEVELS, ICE REMOVAL, AND ADAPTIVE 
MANAGEMENT AT THE ST. LAWRENCE SEAWAY MANAGEMENT 
CORPORATION

A changing climate is likely to produce significant impacts for transportation operators in the Great Lakes-
St. Lawrence Seaway. The Seaway is an important international marine shipping route spanning 3,700 km 
over many jurisdictions. Critical stretches include the Welland Canal (connecting Lakes Ontario and Erie) 
and the segment from Lake Ontario to Montreal. The St. Lawrence Seaway Management Corporation 
(SLSMC) is the Canadian agency responsible for ensuring marine traffic moves safely and efficiently through 
13 of the waterway’s 15 locks.

There is much uncertainty regarding water levels throughout the Seaway, as they tend to vary year-to-
year. Some studies suggest lower water levels will be the norm through the 21st century (Shlozberg et al., 
2014). Other studies suggest that increased precipitation may cause periodic fluctuations in these levels 
(MacKay and Seglenieks, 2013). Either way, strategies to deal with uncertainty are recommended.  For 
shippers, lower water levels pose risks to shipping capacity and efficiency, reducing the volume of freight 
that can be moved. Andrey et al. (2014) suggests that for each centimetre of water lost, the capacity of 
an average ship decreases by six containers (60 tons). 

Over the short-term, significant ice formation has been problematic for shippers and infrastructure 
operators in the Seaway, including the SLSMC. Ice build-up delays seasonal opening and increases 
removal, break-up, and flushing requirements. While flow-management infrastructure upgrades are 
considered too costly and difficult to implement (Andrey et al, 2014), the SLSMC has adopted a number of 
adaptive procedures in light of observed and projected impacts.

For instance, the SLSMC collects extensive climate data to determine how environmental conditions will 
affect infrastructure performance over the short and long term. It also monitors water levels, temperature 
and wind conditions, and ice patterns. The organization uses this data to predict seasonal Seaway opening 
and closing dates, secure requisite ice-breaking services and assets, and rent an appropriate volume of 
ice-management equipment for channels and locks. 

However, practitioners have observed increased variability in weather along the Seaway in recent years, 
making it difficult for the SLSMC to accurately predict opening and closing conditions and associated 
processes. During the navigation season, the SLSMC has procedures to deal with extreme (short-term) 
events, including wind causing low water levels. These include: 

• 

Suspending navigation and temporarily redirecting vulnerable vessels to safe anchorage areas until 
conditions become acceptable again. 

•  Activating “no-meet zones” when required (prohibiting two-way marine traffic), 

•  Restricting speed and draft to reduce navigational risks (i.e. striking bottom).  

Reduced maximum permissible shipping draft6 is an especially problematic impact of declining water 
levels, since the costs of reduced efficiency are transferred to shippers and businesses further down 
the supply chain. To increase safety for deep-draft vessels, many vessels have installed onboard Draft 
Information Systems. This software application provides graphical representations of the anticipated under-
keel conditions for a vessel given its position, speed, and heading in relation to surrounding water levels 
and bathymetry. The system allows vessels to take proactive, draft-altering measures to ensure safe transit 
by adjusting speeds. In 2014, 39 inland commercial ships used this application in the Seaway, though there 
is potential for greater uptake.

Ice is another major consideration for the SLSMC, and caused delays opening the Montreal-Lake Ontario 
Seaway section in 2014, increasing removal, break-up, and flushing requirements. Ice management

 Draft refers to the vertical distance between the waterline and the bottom of a ship’s hull. This affects the  
depth of a ship in the water.

depends heavily on coordination with the Canadian and U.S. Coast Guards for support from their ice-
breaking vessels. The SLSMC also contracts tugboats with scrapers and excavators for ice management 
when needed. 

Ice does not typically delay opening of the Welland Canal. However, at the beginning of the 2014 season, 
ships travelling through the passage from St. Catharines to Port Colborne had nowhere to go because of 
ice on Lakes Erie, Superior, and Huron. Ice was also blown into locks, causing temporary delays.  

Ice is a more significant concern from Lake Ontario to Montreal, due to greater geographic diversity and 
more severe conditions overall. Ice curtains and air bubblers are used to keep locks free from ice where 
and when it is feasible to do so. Increasing ice-management capacity has proven useful for adapting to 
changing patterns of winter weather extremes, but may become less costly as winters gradually warm 
throughout the Seaway.

Written in collaboration with Shari Grady (St. Lawrence Seaway Management Corporation).

8.0 A MULTI-MODAL APPROACH TO TRANSPORTATION AND ADAPTATION

A changing climate will affect Central and Northern Ontario differently than the South, and 
adaptive capacity varies considerably among municipalities within these sub-regions. Compared 
to the South, these two sub-regions encompass a larger area, and have fewer data and resources 
available to support adaptive decision-making for transportation (Chiotti and Lavender, 2008). The 
provincial government has taken steps to determine appropriate climate adaptation strategies for 
transportation in these regions, and has initiated a multimodal study of Ontario’s “near north” and 
“far north” (approximating the central and northern sub-regions) (Caroline De Groot, Ministry of 
Transportation of Ontario, personal communication, 2015). 

This study will identify short-, medium-, and long-term improvements for all modes of transportation. 
It will also provide transportation users and service-providers with tangible adaptation solutions and 
decision-makers with a foundation for action, by identifying:

•  Strong analytical evidence (i.e. rigorous, scientific climate data) to support anecdotal evidence 

of climate change (i.e. shorter winter-road access seasons); 

•  Possible effects of climate change on Northern Ontario’s construction, operations, and 

maintenance standards for roads, railways, airports, and marine infrastructure; and, 

•  Best-practice alternatives and strategic directions to address the challenges mentioned above.

Despite progress on a number of initiatives in the province, barriers to adaptation in the transportation 
sector persist. Limited resources and expertise can be are obstacles to developing and implementing 
meaningful adaptation strategies, particularly in Central and Northern Ontario. 

The cumulative impacts of climate change on transportation infrastructure, referring to two or more 
simultaneous impacts, are understudied and difficult to predict. For instance, increasing numbers of freeze-
thaw cycles in Ontario may combine with non-traditional, mid-winter flood events exceeding stormwater 
thresholds, creating destructive lifting and shearing forces on highways, bridges, locks, and harbours, with 
potentially costly and damaging effects. While concrete examples of these impacts are lacking in Ontario, 
recent winter storm events in the United States and United Kingdom suggest that infrastructure damage 
resulting from flooding on frozen ground may be severe (Oh et al., 2010; Met Office, 2014). 

Treating adaptation as an issue separate from other aspects of transportation is an additional 
constraint.  Communities and practitioners in Canada have not yet integrated adaptation goals into 
much of their transportation planning and decision-making (Newman et al., 2013; Henstra, 2015). 
Some initiatives in Ontario, such as those highlighted in case studies, represent noteworthy exceptions. 

Constraints also exist within the climate science and adaptation community, the transportation sector 
(broadly considered), and the integration of efforts across these two fields. The variety and complexity 
of available climate model data makes it difficult for decision-makers to assess vulnerability and 
determine appropriate adaptation options. Engineers Canada (2012) also argues that a lack of 
localized climate projections makes it difficult for decision-makers to justify investing in more expensive 
adaptive infrastructure over cheaper infrastructure, which is typically designed for historic climate 
pressures (often with the use of outdated data). Remedies to this situation include maintaining and 
developing more robust historical records and climate modeling processes, and training engineers in 
dealing effectively with climate uncertainty. 

A further challenge is the traditional complexity of the freight system and different jurisdictional 
responsibilities. Considering the range of actors and agencies at play in international road freight 
activity, it is often difficult to determine how to undertake climate adaptation, and who is responsible. 

10.0 CONCLUSIONS

Ontario faces diverse and potentially costly risks associated with changing climate conditions 
and evolving transportation requirements. While Ontario’s adaptive capacity is generally high, 
vulnerabilities to extreme weather and gradual changes in climate present challenges to 
transportation decision-makers and infrastructure operators. 

The adaptation practices described in this chapter speak to the willingness of decision makers to 
confront the risks to efficiency and safety posed by a changing climate to both infrastructure and 
operations. The challenge at all levels is to provide coordinated, timely, and effective responses to 
these risks.

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016KEY FINDINGS

•  Climate change will affect the natural environment of all regions of Quebec and may damage or 

cause service interruptions to transportation systems. Nunavik has, and will continue to, experience 
significant climate change and will have to deal with the thawing of the permafrost on which 
transportation infrastructure is built. In eastern Quebec, the increase in relative sea level, loss of ice 
cover, freeze-thaw cycles and changes to storm systems will contribute to further erosion of riverbanks 
and shorelines. For all regions of Quebec, Surface runoff management is a challenge.

• 

The vulnerability of transportation systems to climate change varies according to regional 
characteristics, the type of infrastructure and its use. The condition and maintenance of 
infrastructure, the current use of transportation systems and the availability of alternatives during 
service interruptions, are all factors that influence the scope of climate change impacts on 
transportation systems.

•  Extreme weather events represent one of the greatest risks for the transportation sector, in all 

the regions of Quebec. Episodes of heavy rain, floods, coastal erosion and landslides will affect 
both the transportation infrastructure and the mobility of people and goods. The isolation of 
communities that depend more on one particular mode of transportation could be accentuated 
by extreme weather events.

•  Although thawing permafrost is the most significant climate change impact affecting Quebec’s 

northern communities, similar to the northern territories, rising temperatures are also reducing winter 
mobility due to shorter freezing periods.   The shorter winter season and loss of ice cover make access 
to the region and its resources more difficult for individuals who depend on them for their way of life.  

•  Climate change adaptation issues represent significant social, institutional, environmental 

and economic challenges. Success stories in this area are the result of multisectoral initiatives, 
involving players from the public and private sectors and civil society, and their inclusion in 
existing planning efforts. 

•  Acquiring data to monitor the condition of infrastructure and efforts to search for effective 
solutions for transportation systems are key means of adapting to the inevitable changes. 
Adaptation options will affect both the design and management practices for the operation and 
maintenance of infrastructure.  Analysing the potential performance of these options depends on 
a solid knowledge of the transportation systems and the environment in which they operate.

In Quebec, transportation plays a major role in supporting the vitality of regions, the distribution of 
goods and services, and the exploitation of natural resources. Most transportation infrastructure (road, 
rail, marine and air) was designed with a stable climate in mind, but climate change is affecting both 
the lifespan and condition of the infrastructure. The size of the province, the remote nature of certain 
Quebec communities, and the limited redundancy of the transportation system,4 in the regions most 
affected by climate change, are also factors that increase its vulnerability.

For nearly 20 years, the Quebec government, carrier associations, expert panels, and companies 
have been making greater efforts to adapt transportation systems to climate change and thus 
strengthen its resilience. These efforts have enhanced knowledge about the impacts and potential 
solutions to improve the management of transportation infrastructure. 

This chapter describes the organization of transportation in Quebec by mode and by region, and 
identifies its main vulnerabilities to climate change, based on existing literature and studies. The 
chapter also identifies adaptation practices that could be used to address these challenges. 

1.1 REGIONAL PROFILE 

DEMOGRAPHICS AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC CONTEXT

Quebec covers more than 1.6M km2 (Institut de la statistique du Québec, 2014) and has 
approximately 8,263,600 residents (Institut de la statistique du Québec, 2015; see Figure 1), making this 
province the second most populated in the country.  More than half (60%) of the Quebec population 
is concentrated in an area 10 km wide on either side of the St. Lawrence river (Institut de la statistique 
du Québec, 2014). 

More specifically, the Quebec population is concentrated in a few large urban areas in the southern 
part of the province (Montréal, Québec City, Gatineau, Sherbrooke, Trois-Rivières). In other regions, 
the population is more dispersed. For example, Nunavik makes up a little less than one-third of the 
territory and has approximately 12,700 residents in 14 northern villages and the Cree community of 
Whapmagoostui.

Population growth is expected in 13 of the 17 administrative regions of Quebec by 2061 (Girard, 
B-Charbonneau and F-Payeur, 2014). The regions which are expected to see this population growth 
will be those supported by international migration (Montréal and Laval), inter-regional migration 
(Outaouais), internal migration (Laval, Lanaudière), and a rising fertility rate (Nunavik).

As shown in Table 1, the urban areas of the National Capital,5 Montréal, Montérégie, Laval and the 
Outaouais are characterized by their significant industrial diversity, and account for 67.4% of the Gross 
Domestic Product (GDP). The proximity of these areas to waterways and international transportation 
infrastructure is vital to their success. Other regions depend more on the extraction of raw materials 
or tourism. The area of the gulf and estuary of the St. Lawrence is home to close to 5% of Quebec’s 
population and accounts for a similar share of the province’s economy (Beaulieu, 2014).

 The redundancy of a transportation system refers to the alternatives the system provides, ensuring additional routes and services 
if the first option is disrupted. A system with little redundancy provides few options.

2.0 ORGANIZATION OF TRANSPORTATION IN QUEBEC

The transportation of goods and people in Quebec is multimodal and interconnected (CPCS, 2013). 
While trucking is the preferred mode for transporting goods; railways and waterways that connect the 
St. Lawrence to the Great Lakes, also play an important role. Air transport, meanwhile, carries a lesser 
volume of goods, but remains a strategic mode when delivery must be done quickly and the weight 
of the goods is not an issue (CPCS, 2013: 2-29).

In Canada, the St. Lawrence is a key continental gateway. This multimodal axis of transportation is 
strategic for the economy, demographics and geography of the country, making Quebec a hub 
for the transportation of goods to other provinces and to the United States. The Quebec-Windsor 
corridor concentrates approximately 80% of the activities of VIA Rail Canada (2014). The St. Lawrence 
drainage basin, which includes the Great Lakes, is the largest drainage system in the world, draining 
more than one quarter of the world’s fresh water reserves (Institut de la statistique du Québec, 2014). 

Other regions of Quebec are connected to the southern part of the province by strategic corridors 
that allow for the exploitation of resources, such as forests, hydroelectricity and minerals. These regions 
depend primarily on roads for the transportation of goods and people. There are also air connections 
for each of these regions. The size of the area and the dispersed population result in major challenges 
in planning and managing transportation networks (Ministère des Transports du Québec, 2013a).

 
CHAPTER 7: QUEBEC

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Finally, the 14 Inuit communities and the Cree community of Whapmagoostui in Nunavik are only 
accessible from the southern part of the province by air or sea, as are the Magdalen Islands and 
certain communities located in the far eastern portion of the lower North Shore. 

In Quebec, the planning, design, and management of transportation infrastructure; as well as 
construction, repair and maintenance work, are the responsibility of several institutional and private 
partners. Various Quebec government departments, public transportation agencies, public transit 
agencies, federal government departments and agencies, carrier associations, inter-municipal 
councils and municipal transportation agencies, local municipalities, regional county municipalities, 
metropolitan communities and First Nations communities are all involved to varying degrees. 

Quebec’s Ministère des Transports, de la Mobilité durable et de l’Électrification des transports 
(MTMDET)  plays a central role in the management and sharing of responsibilities for transportation 
infrastructure. Highways; national, regional and collector roads; and some access roads to remote 
resources and communities fall under Quebec’s jurisdiction (Ministère des Transports du Québec, 
2015b). The MTMDET shares the management of these networks with carriers and private operators, 
as well as some local and regional authorities.6 The main railway networks are primarily under federal 
jurisdiction, but are also under provincial jurisdiction (short lines), as well as under the responsibility 
of a dozen private organizations, or large railway companies such as Canadian National (CN) or 
Canadian Pacific (CP). Quebec ports and airports are owned and managed by a wide range of 
public and private stakeholders.

Furthermore, the MTMDET produces manuals and guides to direct the design, management and 
maintenance of transportation structures and systems. These manuals are used as the main reference 
guide by Quebec municipalities for roads under their responsibility. 

Figure 1 presents Quebec transportation infrastructure and shows the diversity of the main 
infrastructure in Quebec and the many organizations that share in its management.

The Quebec-Ontario Continental Gateway and Trade Corridor initiative was undertaken jointly by the 
Quebec, Ontario and Canadian governments in 2007. It aimed to create an integrated multimodal 
transportation system that was reliable, sustainable and competitive to support international trade. In 
this respect, the St. Lawrence valley can be considered the main corridor in Quebec’s transportation 
infrastructure network, and provides for much of the exchange between Quebec and its main 
economic partners. It includes the major urban hubs of Montréal and Québec City. Figure 2 illustrates 
this intermodality across Quebec.

2013 (data from 2010))

 

2.1 ROAD TRANSPORTATION 

Road transportation is one of the most flexible and accessible modes and is proving to be the 
preferred mode for short-distance, inter-regional and inter-provincial transportation of goods and 
people (Ministère des transports du Québec, 2013b). In addition to ensuring access to much of 
Quebec, road infrastructure facilitates intermodal connections with rail terminals, ports and airports 
(CPCS, 2013).

There are approximately 319,000 km of roads in Quebec, including highways, national roads, 
collector roads, streets, bridges and overpasses, access roads and local roads (Ministère des 
Transports du Québec, 2015b; see Figure 3). There are also more than 300,000 kilometers of multi-use 
roads in forest settings. 

Aging of infrastructure increases its vulnerability and maintenance costs. The average age of 
infrastructure provides a means of evaluating the condition of the network and the need for investments 
to ensure its maintenance. Reinvestment in this area since the early 2000’s has reduced the average 
age of roads in Quebec from 18 years in 2000, to 13 years in 2009 (Gagné and Haarman, 2011). 

Certain regions are heavily dependent on a single road link for their regular supply and mobility 
needs. Accessibility to these regions could be significantly compromised after a major weather event 
(e.g., flood, landslide, erosion etc.,) causes damages to the road link.

Although user behaviour is often the cause of accidents, the contribution of weather conditions must 
also be considered in road safety management (Andrey, 2010). Moreover, the number of collisions 
increases during times of precipitation (Andrey and Mills, 2002). However, the number of road 
accidents has been on the decline since 2007, in Quebec and elsewhere in Canada.

 
CHAPTER 7: QUEBEC

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Some tourist regions such as the Gaspé, the Magdalen Islands, the North Shore and the lower St. 
Lawrence have developed facilities and activities to promote the region and attract visitors. Theme 
routes,7 such as the Route des baleines or the Route des Navigateurs, and national parks that draw on 
their relationship with the river (such as the Saguenay-St. Lawrence Marine Park and the Parc National 
du Bic) are pillars of tourist development in these regions. Loss of access to these parks due to erosion 
of roads bordering the river would affect economic and social development. The same is true for 
the Routes bleues, another theme route, and its related infrastructure, which are also affected by 
changes observed along the St. Lawrence (coastal erosion, decreasing water levels, etc.). 

Finally, some portions of the Quebec road network are highly congested with traffic, especially 
in the two metropolitan areas of Québec City and Montréal (MTQ, 2013a). Reduced speed due 
to congestion increases transit time as well as the cost of road transportation. It also reduces the 
dependability or perceived dependability of the mode of transportation. Traffic congestion combined 
with the projected rise in summer temperatures and increased frequency, duration and intensity of 
heat waves, could also have important implications for road freight management systems in the 
future, particularly concerning new refrigeration requirements, choices of materials for pavement, 
and other factors. (Goodwin, 2004; James and James, 2010).

Marine transportation is closely tied to a number of key sectors of the Quebec economy, and plays a 
major role in the movement of goods along the St. Lawrence corridor. Marine transportation activity, 
including shipping, port and cruise tourism services, has been increasing in Quebec since 2000. In 
2011, these activities represented sales of more than $2.3 billion. 

Ports along the St. Lawrence primarily move mineral ore, forestry products, agricultural and food 
products, manufactured goods, fuel and chemical products, and machinery (St. Lawrence Economic 
Development Council, 2015), in addition to supplying industries and communities (see Figure 2). 

Nunavik, the coastal communities in the Eeyou-Istchee James Bay region and several municipalities 
along the North Shore are also equipped with marine infrastructure consisting of breakwaters, access 
ramps, beacons, or floating pontoons that serve the local population. In most cases, this infrastructure 
is the main supply link for remote communities. Some larger marine infrastructure serves industrial 
activity in these same regions. For example, a private deep-water wharf at Baie Déception in Nunavik 
serves a mining operation, and other private industrial dock projects could be developed in the 
region with increased mining activity.

The main commercial ports in Quebec include the ports under the jurisdiction of Canadian port 
authorities in Montréal, Trois-Rivières, Québec City, Saguenay and Sept-Îles. Other ports and marine 
infrastructure play an important role in supporting recreational tourism activities and other local needs.

The port network in Quebec handled 130.4 million tonnes of goods in 2011, three quarters which 
were international goods (Statistics Canada, 2011). The Port of Montréal is the largest container port 
in eastern Canada (Port of Montreal, 2015), receiving more than one million 20-foot equivalent unit 
containers annually. Playing a pivotal role in the transportation of goods, it is directly connected to rail 
and road networks. Each week 80 trains pass through the port, with 5,000 trucks arriving and leaving 
each day (Port of Montreal, 2015). The ports of Sept-Îles-Pointe-Noire, Port-Cartier, Baie-Comeau and 
HavreSaintPierre on the North Shore are among the ten largest ports in Quebec in terms of tonnage 
of goods handled (Ministère de l’Énergie et des Ressources Naturelles, 2011). The deep water port in 
Québec City that specializes in transshipment serves as a true intermodal hub for trade in the Great 
Lakes – St. Lawrence River corridor. The port in Sept-Îles is the third largest port in Canada in terms of 
bulk tonnage handled. 

Ferries managed by the Société des traversiers du Québec are linked to the land transportation 
system to enhance people’s mobility. In some urban areas, connections to public transportation 
networks also facilitate intra-regional and inter-regional travel. Ferry activity, however, is subject to 
economic fluctuations (ROCHE-Deluc, 2010). Ferries are also exposed to weather conditions and the 
impact of climate change. On the St. Lawrence, 18 ferries operate year-round and serve more than 
five million passengers and more than two million vehicles (Société des traversiers du Québec, 2014). 

2.3 RAIL TRANSPORTATION 

The Quebec rail network mainly follows the St. Lawrence valley and extends to the north of the 
province toward regions of Abitibi-Témiscamingue, Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean and Chibougamau, the 
North Shore, and Labrador (see Figure 2). Among other services, it transports intermodal containers 
for forestry products, mining products and aluminum. A large number of rail cars run through the 
Montréal and Québec City regions on their way to other Canadian provinces and the United States 
(Ministère des Transports du Québec, 2008).

Several rail freight service companies serve Quebec. The largest are Canadian National (CN), 
Canadian Pacific (CP) and CSX Transportation, which together make up close to 58% of the current 
network in Quebec. A few manufacturing or resource extraction companies, such as Arcelor Mittal or 
Rio Tinto Alcan, also operate some of the province’s railway lines. With a few exceptions, railways with 

 
CHAPTER 7: QUEBEC

190

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016tracks extending outside of Quebec are under federal jurisdiction, whereas all other tracks are under 
provincial jurisdiction. Transportation of people is primarily provided by Via Rail Canada Inc., but also 
by the Québec North Shore and Labrador Railway, by Amtrak for sections in the southernmost part of 
the province that lead to the United States, and by commuter trains and tourist trains. 

Demand for rail services has increased somewhat since 2001, both for the transportation of goods and 
travelers (Réseau des chemins de fer du Québec, 2011). The rail network under provincial jurisdiction 
has grown in the last 20 years, from 564 kilometers of rail in 1993, to more than 1,700 km in 2015 
(Ministère des Transports du Québec, 2015a). 

2.4 AIR TRANSPORTATION 

The airline sector provides transportation for passengers, freight and other activities, such as 
aeromedical evacuations, ice patrols, aerial application of products and more. Regarding 
freight services, close to 146,000 tonnes, equivalent to $3.7 billion, were transported by the 380 air 
transportation companies in Quebec in 2010 (MTQ 2013a).

There are two international airports (Montréal and Québec City) and various regional airports, 
26 of which are owned by the Ministère des Transports (see Figure 2). There are also close to 150 
aerodromes, approximately 50 seaplane bases and approximately 50 heliports. 

Passenger air traffic in Quebec increased by 4% between 2013 and 2014, reaching 16.5 million 
passengers. (Statistics Canada, 2014). Passenger air traffic should continue to increase, according to 
2012-2022 forecasts.

3.0 A CHANGING CLIMATE8

Climate risks for the transportation sector (infrastructure and services) vary by location and season. 
These considerations are important to better understand the potential impacts of expected changes, 
as they could accentuate the sector’s vulnerabilities.

Québec’s large territory and varied topography (altitude of up to 1,652 m) help to create different 
climates (Ouranos, 2015).  These range from a cold and humid continental climate in the southern 
and eastern parts of the province to a sub-polar continental climate in the central regions, a polar 
tundra climate up north and more of a maritime climate in the coastal areas towards the Gulf of 
the Saint-Lawrence. All of Québec is affected by climate change and certain trends are already 
being observed. 

3.1 RISING TEMPERATURES

Since 1950, temperature trends for both average and extreme temperatures have shown an increase 
in practically all regions in Québec, with extreme cold temperatures showing the most significant 
change. Over the period 1951-2010, decreases were recorded in the number of cold days and 
cold nights as well as in the length of cold spells (Donat et al., 2013). A significant increase was also 
observed during this same period in the number of hot days, hot nights and length of heat spells.

Projections suggest that these trends will continue, with northern latitudes being even more affected. 
Moreover, warming trends will be more prominent for extreme minimum and maximum temperatures

 This chapter presents the current and future climate conditions for Québec for the indicators most relevant to the transportation 
sector. Unless otherwise indicated, all information is from the reference document “Towards Adaptation” (Ouranos, 2015), a 
state of knowledge document published by Ouranos in 2015. More information can be found in Chapter 1 of this document.

temperatures for all of Québec.

and projected (right panels) for the 2050 horizon (2041-2070).  The observed average is calculated 
from CRU TS 3.21 dataset (CRU TS = Climatic Research Unit Timeseries, 3.21 dataset is the name of the 
release). Future maps present the ensemble median (i.e., the median of all the available projections) 
as well as the 10th and 90th percentiles (i.e., lower and higher bounds) of 29 future climate scenarios. 
Future climate scenarios were produced using the “delta” method calculated from the CMIP5 
(Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5) simulations (RCP 8.5) and applied the observed 
data (see Charron, 2014). (Source: Ouranos)

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Warming temperatures will also bring changes to other indicators that affect the transportation sector. 
For example, the cold season will begin later and end earlier, resulting in a season close to one month 
shorter in the south of the province by 2050 (Logan et al., 2016, in press). Projections of degree-days of

Recent observations show a rise in the number of daily freeze-thaw cycles during warmer years 
(Chaumont and Brown, 2010). However, projections for mid-century suggest a decrease in the 
number of freeze-thaw cycles. Indeed, from 2050, it is likely that the cold season will shorten to the 
extent that it will be difficult to reach the same number of freeze-thaw cycles currently observed in a 
given season.

 Note that in this case the historical climate normal values are not calculated from observed data, but instead from simulated 
climate model output which has been corrected to consider observed values using a post-processing method.

Total annual precipitation from observed data shows significant upward trends for many of the 
weather stations located in the south of the province. For some of these stations, the trends are 
associated with increases in spring and fall precipitation.

Increases in precipitation are expected in winter and spring throughout Québec. In the northern 
and more central regions, this would also be the case in the summer and fall seasons. As in the case 
of temperatures, these increases will be more significant for extreme precipitation events than for 
averages. In fact, all climate models agree on future upward trends for extreme precipitation events, 
everywhere in Québec, although these changes are more substantial moving northward. This applies 
for maximum annual amounts in addition to all durations and frequencies. For example, a maximum 
annual rainfall event with a 20-year return period over the 1986-2005 timeframe could occur more 
frequently by 2046-2065 with a return period of around 7 to 10 years. Preliminary studies suggest that 
future climate conditions could be more conducive to thunderstorms, which are usually accompanied 
by larger quantities of precipitation, although the robustness of these projections is uncertain.
For winter precipitation, the proportion of snow and rainfall relative to total accumulation depends 
on temperature. Given that the climate has been warming in the recent past, downward snow 
precipitation trends are already being observed in the south of Québec. An analysis of several 
different data sources reveals that snow cover duration has decreased by approximately 2 days per 
decade in the south of Québec between 1948 and 2005.

Even if snowfall events decrease due to a shorter cold season, rainfall events during this season should 
increase with warming temperatures in winter (see Figure 6). Changes in snow cover with respect 
to these trends will vary according to the region, altitude, climatic regime, type of surface and 
vegetation. Compared to the 1970-1999 average, snow cover duration by 2041-2070 could decrease 
by up to 25 days in the North of Québec, from 25 to 45 days in the central region, from 45 to 75 days 
for the Gulf of the St. Lawrence and between 45 and 65 days for the south of Québec.

With respect to freezing rain, this is a phenomenon that predominantly affects the Saint-Lawrence 
valley due to its morphology and position (Ressler et al., 2012).  While great progress has been made 
to improve knowledge in terms of the conditions likely to generate this type of event, it remains 
uncertain whether the number, duration and intensity of these events will change in Québec over the 
coming decades.

Average observed wind speeds for the great majority of weather stations varies only slightly from 
one season to another. With the exception of a few stations that show minor increases, most stations 
in Québec show downward trends in average wind speed throughout the year over the 1953 to 
2006 period. 

Projections of future winds remain uncertain since very few studies exist on this subject. Additional 
analyses based on a greater number of climate simulations at finer resolutions would be required.

3.4 FLUCTUATING AVERAGE RIVER FLOWS 

Average river flows are expected to increase in winter throughout Québec by 2041-2070. Conversely, 
for the same time period in the south of Québec, decreases in average flows are likely to occur in the 
summer, spring and fall seasons although consensus between model outputs is not as high. Figure 8 
shows expected changes in spring freshet, the spring thaw resulting from snow and ice melt in rivers. 
More information on future changes to watersheds in southern Québec can be found in the “Atlas 
hydroclimatique du Québec méridional” (Centre d’expertise hydrique du Québec, 2015).

Figure 8: The hydrological indicator Q14max20p provides an indication of the volume of spring freshet 
for the 20-year return period. (Source: Centre d’expertise hydrique du Québec)

3.5 RELATIVE SEA LEVEL 

Changes to relative sea level vary at regional scales because of several factors including marine 
currents, atmospheric circulation, seawater density (itself affected by surface temperatures, 
freshwater supply through waterways or glacier melt), the proximity to ice sheets and glaciers 
(gravitational effects) and other geophysical phenomena (rotational effects). Some of these 
phenomena occur in combination and cancel each other out or fluctuate in time over inter-annual 
or decadal scales, making it difficult to detect significant trends. As a result, rising relative sea levels 
will affect the marine estuary and Gulf of the St. Lawrence. In the Hudson Bay, a drop in relative sea 
level is expected due to postglacial isostatic adjustment in this area diminishing the effect of sea level 
rise.  More information on this can be found in Chapters 3 and 8.

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 20163.6 A PROGRESSIVE LOSS OF SEA ICE COVER

Warming temperatures will also affect sea ice cover (see Chapter 3). More specifically for Québec, 
a study of the marine estuary and Gulf of the St. Lawrence shows ice cover reductions between 1998 
and 2012. The freeze-up season is shorter than in the past despite the fact that interannual variability is 
quite high (Senneville et al., 2014). This same study showed that the proportion of maximum ice cover 
in the region diminished from approximately 47 % (1968-1998) to 36 % (1998-2013). 

These trends are likely to continue and projections indicate that freeze-up could arrive about 10-20 
days later while thawing could begin 20 to 30 days earlier by 2041-2070, compared to 1982-2011 in the 
Gulf of the St. Lawrence. In the Hudson Bay area, the ice-free season could extend up to two months 
longer towards mid-century. Other regions in Québec could also be affected however, existing studies 
on the subject do not make it possible to determine the magnitude of expected changes.

3.7 THAWING PERMAFROST

Québec’s northern region is located in an area of permafrost as illustrated in Figure 9. Permafrost is 
very sensitive to warming temperatures and changing precipitation patterns (see Chapter 3). 

Figure 9: Permafrost distribution in northern Québec. (Source: Allard and Lemay, 2012) 

These conditions will affect the transportation sector at different levels. The following section 
will describe in more detail the main vulnerabilities for the different modes of transportation 
throughout Québec.

Although the projected climate outlook shows that all regions of Quebec can expect rising 
temperatures and heavier precipitation events, the consequences will affect each economic activity 
differently, including transportation infrastructure and mobility. Extreme weather events are likely one 
of the greatest risks for all regions of Quebec. In addition, the built environment in Quebec is aging, 
and certain transportation infrastructure is reaching the end of its useful life or needs considerable 
refurbishment (Canadian Infrastructure Report Card, 2012). It may therefore be more vulnerable to 
the impacts of climate change.

The following sections present the main climate vulnerabilities identified for road, marine, rail and air 
transportation in Quebec. One section also deals with the telecommunication networks on which 
these modes of transportation depend. The vulnerabilities described are those of infrastructure, but 
also, more generally, those of transportation services operations and management. More information 
is available on road transportation, which underscores the importance of this mode in terms of modal 
share, as well as current research and development efforts. 

4.1 GROUND TRANSPORTATION

4.1.1  VULNERABILITIES OF ROAD TRANSPORTATION IN SOUTHERN QUEBEC AND ALONG 

THE ST. LAWRENCE 

In the area that extends to the east of Québec City to the lower North Shore (covering the Lower 
St. Lawrence, the Gaspé Peninsula and the Magdalen Islands), roads and villages are located along 
the coast. One third of the population in this region and close to 60% of national roads are located 
less than 500 metres from the shoreline (Drejza et al., 2014; Boyer-Villemaire et al., 2014). Some portions 
of Route 132 that follow the entire south shore of the St. Lawrence, from the United States border west 
of Montréal to Gaspé, are located anywhere from a few meters to a few dozen meters from the shore 
(McHugh et al., 2006). 

In the 20th century, this proximity to the river was seen as favourable for transportation, due to the 
supply of natural resources and marine exploitation. However, the establishment of roads and facilities 
along the St. Lawrence now appears to be a factor that exacerbates their vulnerability (Drejza et al., 
2015). The rise in annual average temperatures and especially rising winter temperatures recorded since 
the 1980’s (Bernatchez et al., 2008, Bernatchez, 2015; Savard et al., 2008) have various consequences 
such as a reduction in ice cover, a relative rise in sea level and an acceleration of cryogenic processes, 
which contribute to erosion (Bernatchez et al., 2011; Bernatchez et al., 2015; Boyer-Villemaire et al., 
2014). More than half of the St. Lawrence estuary and gulf coastlines are prone to erosion (Drejza et 
al., 2015). Along the estuary and gulf coastal zone, 294 kilometers of roads are considered to be at risk 
by 2065 (Bernatchez et al., 2015). The growth in the built environment along the St. Lawrence estuary 
increases the magnitude of the impact (Bernatchez and Fraser, 2011; Bernatchez et al., 2015; Ouranos, 
2015).  The impacts of climate change are already being felt on road infrastructure (Drejza et al., 2014). 
Several studies have found that erosion problems have required considerable investment to move roads 
or build remedial works (Ouranos, 2015; Bernatchez et al., 2015).

Freeze-thaw cycles are also causing the erosion of several rock cliffs in the St. Lawrence estuary 
and gulf, in southern Quebec (Bernatchez et al., 2014) (see box on coastal erosion in the Magdalen 
Islands), especially in the middle of the cold season by contributing to the continuous expansion of 
water in the ground, in cliffs or in road surfaces, which can cause cracks, splitting and detachment of 
cliffs or mud slides (Boucher-Brossard and Bernatchez, 2013; Drejza et al., 2015).  Although surfaces are 
usually designed to resist frost for approximately four months and to withstand large quantities of snow 
and melt, rapid snow and ice melt renders these surfaces more vulnerable. Mild temperature periods, 
which are projected to rise in frequency (Ouranos, 2015) also increase and intensify roadway damage 
(Chaumont and Brown, 2010; Doré et al., 2014). Roadways currently have a reduced useful lifespan 

 
CHAPTER 7: QUEBEC 

198
198

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016specifically because of the cracking phenomenon that lets rain water penetrate and consequently 
increase the saturation level of the soil and of roadway materials (Masseck, 2014).

The relative rise in sea level of approximately 40 centimeters since the beginning of the 20th century 
exposes several portions10 of the Quebec road system, in particular along Highway 20 and Route 
132 (Bernatchez and Fraser, 2011). The rise of relative sea level, among other things, reduces soil 
stability under buildings, infrastructure and roads in Quebec (Bernatchez et al., 2012). It decreases 
the stability of the transport system as a whole and, consequently, that of the supply and mobility 
system. The acceleration of this phenomenon is likely to increase the risk of road flooding from storm 
surges in the St. Lawrence corridor (Savard et al, 2016. Lemmen et al., 2008; Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change, 2013). The problem of waves and tides on the Quebec coast along 
the Gulf and up the middle estuary is further compounded by the fact that the coast will be less 
protected by decreasing ice cover. In addition, submersion events could become increasingly 
frequent and intense and reach areas that, until now, were not highly affected. Without adaptation 
measures that respect the coast’s geomorphology, erosion will continue to affect the natural 
system, the integrity of the built environment and the quality of life for most communities living in 
coastal areas (Bernatchez, 2015; Ouranos, 2015).

Riprap11, seawalls, jetties, etc., are forms of protection that reinforce the public’s sense of safety 
(Cooper and Pile, 2014; Friesinger and Bernatchez, 2010; Linham and Nicholls, 2010). That said, these 
methods are costly and may be a factor in the breakdown of some natural slopes and beaches 
(lowering, shrinking, etc.), especially if they are used to protect slopes in loose zones (Bernatchez et 
coll., 2008; Bernatchez, 2015). Where sediment is loose, riprap reduces beaches’ natural ability to 
absorb the energy from storm surges. It is therefore likely to contribute to erosion (Drejza et al., 2014; 
Bernatchez et al., 2011; Bernatchez and Fraser, 2011) and scour at the edges of riprap and other 
artificial linear structures. Furthermore, turbulence that occurs when water hits the edges of a structure 
erodes the sand of any unprotected neighboring areas (Bernatchez and Fraser, 2011). 

In the SeptÎles and Percé regions, the width of beaches has shrunk by 85% and 44% respectively, where 
the shoreline was artificially enhanced by a rigid protective structure (Bernatchez and Fraser, 2011).
Other effects of climate change on terrestrial infrastructure are associated with the increased intensity 
of rain precipitation in the winter that could create negative impacts, in particular for the management 
of surface water runoff (Groleau et al., 2007). For example, existing drainage systems on coastal roads 
can sometimes contribute to the formation of ravines where water collects (Ministère de la Sécurité 
publique du Québec, 2012), and this may trigger landslides and speed up erosion. On the other hand, 
in the south of the province, around the St. Lawrence Valley, rising average temperatures and changes 
in precipitation patterns could have a positive impact due to less snow and ice on roads, which could 
translate into lower costs for ice and snow removal of roads (Webster et al., 2008).  

Other effects of climate change on land infrastructure are summarized in Table 2. 

10  A portion of road corresponds to a route itinerary. It can be regional or local.

 Riprap is an adaptation option built by dumping of stones of various size with a soft slope in order to absorb and dissipate wave 
energy before it reaches the shore (Circé et al., 2016)

dépôts  sableux  probablement  peu  épais  mais  présentant  un  contenu  en  glace  lié  à  la  présence  d’une 
fraction  silteuse  dans  le  profil  stratigraphique.  L’accumulation  de  neige  dans  ce  secteur,  en  cuvette  à 
proximité  du  remblai,  a  certainement  causé  un  réchauffement  du  pergélisol  dans  le  secteur,  ce  qui  a 
accentué  le  problème.  Néanmoins,  il  est  raisonnable  de  penser  que  le  phénomène  ne  devrait  pas 
s’amplifier dans les années à venir et que les mesures habituelles de resurfaçage devraient suffire à le 
compenser.  Les  seuls  problèmes  rencontrés  sur  la  piste  sont  mineurs  et  semblent  attribuables  aux 
procédures d’entretien de la piste.

also by snow and drainage management, decreases the structural integrity of roads (Doré et al., 
 
2014; Ouranos, 2015). The differential settlement associated with permafrost thaw, and its structural 
consequences on embankments specifically, affect drainage networks and alter their integrity 
(Beaulac, 2006; Dumais and Doré, 2013) by causing cracks or settling that require more frequent 
maintenance, as is the case for access roads to the Umiujaq (Figure 10) and Salluit airports.

CHAPTER 7: QUEBEC 

 

200
200

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016A changing climate also affects the mobility of local populations in Nunavik. In winter, frozen lakes 
and streams offer various possibilities for travel by all-terrain vehicle, snowmobile and dog sled. As 
the frost period shortens, these possibilities are reduced (Tremblay et al., 2006; Nickels et al., 2005; 
Bernier et al., 2014). Changes in ice conditions and the shortening of the period when ice is present 
complicate access to natural resources and to subsistence activities (Clerc et al., 2011; Tremblay 
et al., 2006). Access to hunting, gathering, and fishing territory is essential to northern communities, 
and their local economy. Alternative trails can be used, but this change in traditional land reduces 
possibilities to exploit quality nutritional resources (Barrett, 2013). Moreover, local know-how and 
experience no longer allow snow and ice conditions to be predicted as reliably to plan and organize 
travel (Nickels et al., 2005; Samson et al., 2013). These consequences are likely to affect the cultural 
identity and health of northern populations, in addition to their economic development.

4.1.3 EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS AND ROAD TRANSPORT

Extreme weather events will affect road transportation in all regions. Events such as heavy 
precipitation, storms and temperature variations (e.g., freeze-thaw cycles) cause accelerated 
wear of road infrastructure (Auld and MacIver, 2005; Case, 2008; Larrivée, 2010). Moreover, when 
infrastructure nears the end of its useful life it becomes more vulnerable to extreme weather events 
(Ouranos, 2015). This could increase road maintenance requirements. The integrity and performance 
of culverts and bridges may also be affected. 

In Nunavik, an increase in the occurrence of extreme weather events will have an impact on 
transportation. Some events (e.g., blizzards, wind, heavy snow) reduce visibility, affecting driving conditions 
and the safety of travel on land, causing delays and isolating communities from essential services.

Extreme weather events can also isolate communities, particularly those that depend on a single mode 
of transportation. The absence of alternative transportation services contributes to the vulnerability 
of populations in these regions. For example, the strong waves and storm surges produced by strong 
winds that hit the shores of the Lower Saint-Lawrence, Gaspé, Magdalen Islands and the North Shore on 
December 5th and 6th, 2010 generated tides 5.54 meters above chart datum in Rimouski, an exceptional 
height (Quintin et al., 2013). The storm flooded several roads, including Routes 132, 199, 299, 198, rendering 
them impassable to traffic.  The assault of the waves and strong rains damaged roadways, certain 
retaining walls, and the area surrounding walls and culverts (see Figure 11). On the basis of replacement 
costs per kilometer and taking into account the existing geographical situation and means of coastal 
protection (Bernatchez et al., 2015), damage was estimated at several million dollars and several 
hundred people had to be evacuated (St-Amour, 2011). This winter storm demonstrates the effects that a 
combination of factors, such as a reduction in ice cover, a relative rise in sea level, and wind direction and 
storms, can have on natural and built environments.

CHAPTER 7: QUEBEC 

201
201

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Storm surges are related to the height of the sea above the astronomical tide during heavy storms. 
More frequent storm surges could increase marine submersion events as well as erosion of natural 
environments such as beaches and dune ridges. Storms can also cause the collapse of breakwaters, 
dams and other hydraulic structures (Bernatchez et al., 2012).

If sandy beaches are exposed to strong winds for long periods of time in the spring and fall, the winds can 
carry sand and contribute to moving dunes. This affects road maintenance in the Magdalen Islands.

The main meteorological factors that can affect forest fires include temperature, wind speed and 
direction, relative humidity, precipitation and atmospheric stability (Ordre des ingénieurs forestiers 
du Québec, 2009). These factors vary in time and space, and will likely have a greater adverse 
effect in the northwest region of the province (Boulanger et al., 2013). The section of the road system 
located within the limits of commercial forestry operations primarily serves this industry. Fires caused by 
lightning can have a major impact on road access to resources and at the same time, on the vitality 
of these industries’ operations and the communities that depend on them. 

In 2013, the Société de protection des forêts contre le feu (SOPFEU) fought 84 fires (SOPFEU, 2014). 
During the summer of that same year, major fires at the northern limit of the commercial forestry 
operations required protection of the Eastmain and Baie-Johan-Beetz communities. In the James 
Bay region, the only road connecting Matagami to Radisson was closed for over 300 kilometers, 
requiring the evacuation of several hundred workers, leaving communities isolated by the flames 
(Gouvernement du Québec, 2013; see Figure 12). 

Figure 12: Forest fire in Chibougamau in 2005. 
(Source: Société de protection des forêts 
contre le feu) 

Other types of disturbances to road transportation 
are also associated with extreme weather events. 
The uprooting of trees can disrupt road access due 
to the presence of debris.  Also, transport planning 
and road maintenance could be disrupted due 
to the increased frequency and intensity of heat 
waves, as extreme heat can expose workers to 
occupational illnesses and injuries (e.g., heat stroke, 
heat exhaustion and heat cramps) (National 
Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, 2016). 
Recommended controls for reducing workplace 
heat stress include engineering controls (e.g., 
use of reflective or heat-absorbing shielding or 
barriers) and work practices (training, hydration, 
acclimatization and rest breaks) (National Institute 
for Occupational Safety and Health, 2016; 
Commission des normes, de l’équité, de la santé et 
de la sécurité du travail, 2016).

4.2 MARINE TRANSPORTATION

Some marine infrastructure dates back several decades, with the exception of northern infrastructure 
which was created at the turn of the 21st century by the provincial and federal governments and 
local authorities (Clerc et al., 2011; Ministère des Transports du Québec, 2011). Aging infrastructure, 
along with rising temperatures, reduced ice cover and increased frequency and intensity of extreme 
weather events, could increase marine transportation vulnerability.

4.2.1 MARINE TRANSPORTATION IN THE ST. LAWRENCE CORRIDOR

Scientific studies differ on the precise effect of climate change on fluctuations in water levels and 
flow between Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence. Due to human interventions (e.g., buildings, 
water level control, etc.), it is difficult to establish the expected magnitude of associated levels and 
flow (Bouchard and Cantin, 2015). That said, simulations of the effect of higher temperatures on 

 
CHAPTER 7: QUEBEC 

202
202

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016evaporation in the Great Lakes tend toward a possible reduction of levels and flow in the river portion 
of the St. Lawrence (Bouchard and Cantin, 2015). Conversely, in the lower St. Lawrence, in the estuary 
and the gulf, a changing climate would likely result in a rise in water level.

In the Montréal area, where an average of approximately 2,200 vessels pass each year and where 
more than one million twenty foot equivalent unit (TEU) containers are transported annually (Port of 
Montréal, 2015), this reduction could be in the order of 0.5 to 1.0 meter (Croley, 2003; Fagherazzi et al., 
2004; Lefaivre, 2005; Roy and Boyer, 2011). Such a decrease could potentially cause a decline in the 
number of container ships stopping at the Port of Montréal (Slack and Comtois, 2016).

Anticipated changes to flow and water levels will affect marine traffic, as well as the entire 
intermodal freight transportation system organized around the Port of Montréal. At the same time, 
rising temperatures could provide a business opportunity to the Port of Montréal, due to a longer 
commercial navigation season upstream.  The navigation season currently extends from the end of 
March to the end of December. 

Tidal and ice movements associated with a rise in temperatures also affect sediment transport and 
silting.  This could require adjustments in the management and maintenance of waterways and 
marine infrastructure.  Sediment transport will likely affect navigation throughout the St. Lawrence 
corridor. In some strategic areas, the accumulation of sediment can reduce water levels and become 
an obstacle to navigation, which could increase the need to dredge channels and other areas 
surrounding marine infrastructure (Slack and Comtois, 2016). 

Climate projections indicate that in 2040-2070 (compared to the 1982-2011 baseline period), freezing 
will occur 10 to 20 days later in the estuary and the Gulf, and thaw will be 20 to 30 days earlier 
(Senneville et al., 2014). As a result, the period of time when ice traditionally covers the St. Lawrence 
(the months of January, February and March) could be considerably shortened. Ice protects the 
coasts against wave and storm erosion. Although a reduction in the freeze-up period benefits 
navigation, an absence or decrease in ice cover will cause waves and storms to erode the coastline, 
even in the winter (Bernatchez et al., 2015; Bernatchez et al., 2010; Savard et al., 2010). Also, ice 
pile-up near marine infrastructure, caused by strong winds and sea currents, could contribute to the 
deterioration of these facilities. 

The movement of ferries is also restricted by ice formation. When ice forms rapidly, icebreaking 
services may be needed from the Canadian Coast Guard, or services to some communities must be 
provided by air transport (Société des traversiers du Québec, 2014).  See Chapter 6, case study 4: 
“Water levels, ice removal and adaptive management at the St. Lawrence Seaway Management 
Corporation”.

4.2.2 MARINE TRANSPORTATION IN NUNAVIK

Climate change will affect storm systems and ice cover in Hudson Bay and, consequently, wave 
systems, extreme water levels and the moisture balance of coastal drainage basins (Clerc et al; 
2012; Savard et al., 2016). The main cause of damage to marine infrastructure is the occurrence 
of strong waves associated with the passing of storms. Damage often occurs during extreme 
conditions, which are rare but very intense, and result in the combination of several phenomena 
(e.g. strong waves and extreme water levels) caused by the overlapping of spring tides and storm 
surges (Ouranos, 2015). Studies are underway to precisely quantify the vulnerability of Nunavik 
marine infrastructure to climate change.

4.3 RAIL TRANSPORTATION

In general, climate change vulnerabilities for rail transportation in Quebec are poorly documented. 
The rail management system, which involves private stakeholders and representatives from different 
levels of government (local, provincial and federal) interacting within an international institutional 
framework (Canada and the United States), contributes to the complexity of identifying vulnerabilities 

 
CHAPTER 7: QUEBEC 

203

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016specific to Quebec infrastructure. Nevertheless, it is clear that any impact on the rail system has 
significant repercussions on the entire supply chain in Canada (QGI Consulting, 2009). See Chapter 5 
for more information on these challenges.

Managing water runoff along train tracks is a major concern (AREMA, 2003). Extreme weather events 
and episodes of heavy rain can cause drainage and erosion problems, and increase the risk of a 
system breach due to disruptions in communications. For example, an episode of heavy rain in 2010 
eroded the soil under the tracks of a section of the Arcelor Mittal railway. In addition to preventing the 
trains from moving, the erosion caused a rupture in the fiber optic cables that ensure communication 
throughout the system. Extreme weather events can also increase the risk of tracks being blocked by 
debris. As the climate continues to warm, extreme weather events and episodes of heavy rain will 
become more frequent and/or more pronounced (Ouranos, 2015) increasing the vulnerability of rail 
transportation in Quebec.

Brakes are also frequently tested during bad weather. In some sectors, particularly in the center 
of the province, personnel must remain on site and in personnel camps, during heavy storms. 
Maintenance work is then suspended and delays associated with performing inspections and 
additional maintenance costs are to be expected based on the increasing frequency of such events 
(Gouvernement du Québec, 2015).

Climate factors that contribute to triggering landslides (e.g., abundant rain, rapid snow melt and 
such other events likely to increase as the climate warms) have a tendency to increase rail system 
vulnerability.  This would be especially significant in areas prone to landslides, such as the clay rich 
regions of the St. Lawrence valley, where soil characteristics interact with land use and exacerbate 
the vulnerability of rail transportation systems. 

Similar to road transportation, rail transportation is vulnerable to impacts from forest fires caused 
by lightning. The economic impact of fires is particularly significant for the network in the center of 
the province, where there is little redundancy. In 2013, Arcelor Mittal Mines Canada, which uses rail 
tracks in Quebec and has three camps for its staff, saw its operations restricted for several days near 
Manic-Cinq due to fires and smoke. Access to industrial sites, including those for general maintenance 
activities, was restricted by near zero visibility conditions. Decreased visibility created by bad weather 
(fires, heavy rains, etc.) also makes operating a locomotive more complex and dangerous. 

Changes in freeze-thaw cycles also affect track integrity and can reduce the lifespan of 
infrastructure. They can also trigger landslides, which is particularly problematic on tracks where 
required clearances around the infrastructure are minimal. 

Tracks undergo a certain expansion during times of extreme heat and a certain contraction during 
deep freezes, but generally react well to temperature variations. However, in the context of significant 
thermal variation, this expansion phenomenon can damage tracks.

4.3.1 RAIL TRANSPORTATION IN THE ST. LAWRENCE CORRIDOR

Bank erosion, flooding and submersion problems, phenomena heightened by climate change, affect 
coastal train tracks such as the Charlevoix Railway Inc. and the Gaspé Railway Company, as well 
as railways located along streams, like the Compagnie de chemin de fer de l’Outaouais and the 
Chemin de fer Québec Central.  Erosion can compromise network structural integrity, and even cause 
a complete interruption of activities in the affected region. A landslide in Gascons on the Gaspé 
Peninsula suggests such rail network vulnerabilities in this region (Locat et al., 2013). Furthermore, in the 
Charlevoix and North Shore areas (around Sept-Îles particularly), some track segments are affected 
by challenges related to slope stability, geotechnical issues, or rockfall (Leroueil et al., 2001).

Meteorological conditions, including localized events such as strong winds, thunderstorms and heavy 
precipitation, influence flying conditions throughout Quebec. Combinations of multiple events, such 
as freezing rain followed by strong winds, complicate take-offs and landings.

In southern Quebec, air transportation involves multiple national and international connections 
for passengers and goods. As a reduction in the duration and frequency of freeze-thaw events is 
expected in southern Quebec, runway and aircraft maintenance needs and associated costs could 
be reduced (Mills, 2004), which would be positive for air transportation in the region. 

Nevertheless, an increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events could increase the 
frequency of flight delays and cancellations, limiting the mobility of passengers and goods.

Villages in Nunavik, those on the Magdalen Islands, and those in the far east of the North Shore are 
particularly vulnerable to disruptions in air transportation, as they rely heavily on this mode for inter-
regional travel. 

Airport infrastructure in Nunavik was designed between 1984 and 1991 for a stable climate with 
no special measures to protect against permafrost thaw (Guimond et al., 2010). However, rising 
temperatures, and in some cases increased precipitation and runoff, are contributing to permafrost 
thaw, resulting in differential soil settlements, and premature damage to infrastructure. Snow 
accumulation along runways and embankments serves as an insulator and warms the ground, also 
contributing to thaw (Savard, 2006; Guimond and Boucher, 2013). Some infrastructure is showing signs 
of deterioration attributable to permafrost thaw (Guimond et al., 2010). Access roads and landing 
strips in this region could see their lifespan diminish and thus compromise emergency management 
and services, and require additional maintenance work. Freeze-thaw events in this region further 
complicate de-icing and increase maintenance costs for landing strips.

Extreme weather events also contribute to the vulnerability of air transportation in Nunavik. Although 
few studies have been done on wind, the Quaqtamiut note [translation] “[...] a worsening of strong 
winds and storms in past years” (Clerc et al., 2011). In addition, flight time and, consequently, fuel 
consumption, fluctuate based on winds (Morris, 2011).

Finally, the Société de protection de la forêt regularly flies over central Québec as well as other 
commercial airlines that have connecting flights between the south and north of the province. 
Air transportation is sensitive to extreme weather events. A projected increase in the occurrence 
of such events would increase runway maintenance needs and, as a result, costs associated with 
labour, rental, machinery and products needed to address them. In addition, forest fires and smoke 
considerably reduce visibility for planes, which must adapt their flying methods to ensure safety 
(Transport Canada, 2015, p. 211).

4.5 DISTRIBUTION AND TELECOMMUNICATION NETWORKS

Transport and mobility depend greatly on information technology and communications systems.  
Information and telecommunication networks can be affected by strong winds, thunderstorms, 
lightning, and ice. Although it is difficult to know how climate change will modify the frequency or 
intensity of specific conditions, breaches and breakages caused by these events are likely to affect 
the entire transportation system. The ice storm in southern Quebec in 1998 illustrates the cascading 
effects a disruption due to extreme weather can have on various networks (telecommunications, 
services, electricity, etc.) and thus on the entire transportation system ( Dupigny-Giroux, 2000).

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 20165.0 ADAPTATION MEASURES

Climate change affects all regions of Quebec without concern for administrative limits or shared 
jurisdictions, and depends on the collaboration of various levels of government and Quebec’s civil 
society (Ouranos, 2015). 

Climate change will have both positive and negative effects on construction costs and the lifespan of 
land-based infrastructure (Doré et al., 2014). Several actions can contribute to making infrastructure 
more resilient. Above all, it is important to consider a set of complementary measures. Changing 
design can improve (or maintain) structural performance. However, increased maintenance activities 
and methods to detect early failure can help significantly reduce vulnerability. It is also important to 
pursue work that evaluates the technical, economic and environmental performance of potential 
adaptation measures (Doré et al., 2014; Ouranos, 2015).

This section reviews plans and projects implemented over the last several years by the Quebec 
government, regional and local organizations and authorities, and transportation companies. There 
is relatively little documentation on actions planned or implemented by the private sector to adapt 
Quebec’s transportation infrastructure, management and planning systems to climate change. 

5.1  ADAPTATION MEASURES PLANNED AND IMPLEMENTED BY THE QUEBEC 

GOVERNMENT

In 1996, the Quebec government developed its first Climate Change Action Plan (CCAP), which 
equipped government authorities to better understand climate risks in Quebec. The CCAP developed 
for 2006-2012 ($99 million) aimed to provide government stakeholders, the scientific community 
and non-governmental organizations the means to implement actions to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions and to adapt to climate change (Ministère du Développement durable, de l’Environnement 
et de la Lutte contre les changements climatiques, 2015). Among the 26 measures of this action 
plan, Measure 23 was specifically related to transportation, and gave the MTMDET the mandate of 
evaluating and conducting research that helped better understand phenomena that could affect 
the Quebec transportation system. Studies conducted during this period improved understanding 
of the coastal environment and how it might change due to the effects of climate change, and 
considered the challenges of erosion and flooding within the long-term management of exposed 
infrastructure. Other studies helped better define issues concerning permafrost thaw and integrate 
appropriate strategies for the design, repair and management of infrastructure. 

In 2012, the Quebec government adopted a Government Strategy for Climate Change Adaptation 
20132020 (Gouvernement du Québec, 2012a). The Strategy aims to raise public awareness of climate 
change and mobilize several departments and partners, including the MTMDET, regarding the 
sustainability and adaptation of transportation infrastructure. To improve services offered to the public 
and to adapt transportation, the 2013-2015 MTMDET strategic plan for MTMDET supports diversifying 
modes of transportation. Consideration of climate change is a major part of the plan (MTQ, 2012).

The importance of transportation is also recognized in the current action plan on climate change 
entitled « Le Québec en action vert 2020 » “Quebec Green Action 2020” (Gouvernement du 
Québec, 2012a). This plan, based on the Government Strategy for Climate Change Adaptation 
(Gouvernement du Québec, 2012a), supports crosscutting actions specific to health, the economy, 
infrastructure and the natural environment. Land-use planning is a key element of the plan, aimed 
at strengthening community resilience. Urban densification is identified as a tool for reducing future 
infrastructure needs, including roads (Gouvernement du Québec, 2012a; 2012b). Communication 
among residents and public and private stakeholders is also identified as a cross-cutting action to 
support climate change adaptation. Moreover, the plan provides for “specific training, awareness-
building, knowledge transfer and decision support tools, and technical assistance [...] to targeted 
audiences” (Gouvernement du Québec, 2012a). Efforts on this element have already been launched, 
specifically for government employees.

Local knowledge and community involvement are also important. Knowledge and stories about 
changes to modes of travel and traditional routes help identify changes to the climate that are 
otherwise difficult to document (Grimwood et al., 2012; Samson et al., 2013). 

Significant progress (action, research, awareness-raising) has been made in the last ten years to 
promote anticipatory adaptation (Cuerrier et al., 2015; Bernatchez et al., 2012; Plante et al, 2015). 
In northern Quebec for example, adaptation measures were implemented when the first signs of 
deterioration to transportation infrastructure were observed, before significant climate impacts were 
felt (Guimond et Boucher, 2013). 

Since 2003, the MTMDET has had a thermal monitoring program for airport infrastructure in Nunavik 
(under its jurisdiction), built on land sensitive to thaw (Guimond et Boucher, 2013). In the last decade, 
mapping of permafrost areas in northern communities has been undertaken to support land-use 
planning (L’Hérault et al., 2013). By using data from geotechnical research, such mapping determines 
which areas to avoid, which require more information, and which require special construction 
techniques to address problem areas identified.  A better understanding of constraints helps prioritize 
procedures for the area, based on existing knowledge (L’Hérault et al., 2013; also see Case Study 2). 

In 2007, 12 communities were the subject of a soil classification project led by the Center for Northern 
Studies, and other more detailed studies are underway (Allard, Calmels, et al., 2007; L’Hérault et al., 2013). 
More specifically, the impact of a changing climate on landing strip stability in Nunavik has been the 
subject of several studies since the early 2000’s (Allard, Fortier, et al., 2007; Doré et al., 2014; Allard et al., 
2013.) Researchers have identified methods of intervention to maintain air operations, including more 
frequent maintenance and improvements to drainage techniques (L’Hérault et al., 2013). 

The MTMDET and the Center for Northern Studies recently collaborated in the development of an 
adaptation strategy for airport structures vulnerable to permafrost thaw (Guimond et al., 2010). 
Temperature monitoring devices were embedded at 13 airports in Nunavik to monitor the condition 
of runways in real-time.  Adaptation techniques were tested on two problem sites (see Case Study 
1). The Kuujjuaq landing strip was the subject of a study by Transport Canada, while more generally, 
regular monitoring is undertaken to verify the condition of transportation facilities (airports, access 
roads and marine infrastructure). 

In addition, each municipality is developing a land-use master plan that identifies the areas suitable 
for building in order to ensure the sustainability of transportation infrastructure and operations 
(L’Hérault et al., 2013). Awareness tools and best practice guides have also been developed by 
municipal authorities in order to inform employees and suggest concrete actions to reduce the 
impact of climate change on infrastructure (for example, drainage and snow management on land 
infrastructure).

CASE STUDY 1: MONITORING THE THERMAL BEHAVIOUR OF 
THE SALLUIT AIRPORT ACCESS ROAD AND TESTING A 
METHOD TO DETECT PERMAFROST DEGRADATION ALONG 
LINEAR STRUCTURES IN THE CONTEXT OF CLIMATE CHANGE

A section of the Salluit Airport access road in Nunavik is built on permafrost made up of ice-rich marine 
deposits. Since the early 2000’s, researchers have observed significant degradation linked to permafrost 
thaw in this section. In 2012, the MTMDET proceeded with the reconstruction of this section of road in order 
to maintain safe land access year-round, in the context of a changing climate. The embankment design 
was adapted by integrating it with new design criteria that aimed to promote a rise in the permafrost 
table. Within the framework of this project, two technological innovations were tested: the use of fiber optic 
cable to detect sectors at risk of deterioration along the road, and the implementation of an embankment 
with a large scale heat sink as an adaptation solution. This project was undertaken by the MTMDET, in 
collaboration with the Center for Northern Studies and the Laval University surface engineering research 
group. http://www.mddelcc.gouv.qc.ca/changementsclimatiques/bilan-2012-2013/adaptation.htm 

Monitoring the state of the environment and infrastructure is important and several management measures 
(e.g., snow removal along roads; more frequent cleaning of culverts; identification of alternative routes) 
and design measures (e.g., lessening the slope of the dyke; replacing culverts) can be implemented to 
reduce the impact of climate risks (Transportation Association of Canada, 2010). See the chapter on the 
Northern Territories for additional information on maintenance, monitoring and construction practices 
aimed at maintaining the integrity of infrastructure built on permafrost.

CASE STUDY 2: DAM BREAK AND FLOODING OF THE 
SAGUENAY

In 1996, heavy rains hit the Saguenay region of Quebec.  A series of floods forced the evacuation of 16,000 
people and destroyed several roads and bridges, isolating some populations.

Following these events, the Centre de géomatique du Québec (Quebec Geomatics Center) and the 
Ministère de la Sécurité publique (Department of Public Safety) implemented an interactive on-line 
mapping tool (GéoRISC portal) to guide dam managers and limit the consequences of dam breaks and 
flooding in the region. This management system (SCORE) has been online since 2008, providing continuous 
access to descriptive data for dams in Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean. Among other uses, modelling with 
this data makes it possible to consider the consequences of a dam collapse, recognize the impact that 
precipitation has on the road system, and plan alternative routes.

A research chair in coastal and fluvial engineering was created in 2013 (Gouvernement du Québec, 
2012b). This chair, created within the Institut national de la recherche scientifique (INRS), with the 
collaboration of the MTMDET and MSP, has conducted various research projects on the adaptation of 
design criteria for coastal remedial works (Ministère du Développement durable, de l’Environnement 
et de la Lutte contre les changements climatiques, 2014). In addition, studies on the vulnerability of 
road infrastructure in eastern Quebec were conducted by the chair in coastal geoscience at the 
Université du Québec in Rimouski (Drejza et al, 2014; Drejza et al, 2015.).

Ongoing efforts to model the hydrology of the St. Lawrence drainage basin are helping to plan for the 
impact of climate change on hydrological systems influencing marine transportation (Bouchard et 
Cantin, 2015). However, port authorities and marine industry representatives appear less equipped to 
anticipate extreme weather events such as storms, hurricanes, etc., that will have a greater effect on 
their operations in the coming years (Slack and Comtois, 2016). 

 
CHAPTER 7: QUEBEC 

208
208

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Following a study by INRS (Mailhot et al., 2014), as of 2015 the MTMDET has applied a new loading 
factor of 18 or 20% for watershed flows of 25 km2, depending on the region of Quebec, to account for 
climate change (MTMDET 2015).  This adjustment factor was 10% until recently. The use of the GéoRISC 
portal also contributed to dam management (see Case Study 2). 

On a more local level, several studies (see summary in Savard et al., 2008) led jointly by the Ministère 
de la Sécurité publique, the Université du Québec à Rimouski, Ouranos and the City of SeptÎles, 
contributed to a better understanding of the causes and factors associated with coastal erosion. 
The municipality of Sept-Îles then zoned its territory to better control usage along the shoreline and 
performed a cost-benefit analysis of various solutions for structures already threatened by the loss 
of coastal terrain. The City of Sept-Îles, where roads are seriously affected by bank erosion, has 
implemented a sand refill strategy for those beaches that are most threatened by erosion. It has also 
prohibited riprap in several areas. 

Although it is included on a list of remedial works to prevent road erosion, riprap may be less 
advantageous from an economic and structural perspective than alternative protection options 
depending on the nature of the coast (Bernatchez and Fraser, 2012). Similarly, because sand refill, 
riprap and oversizing alone cannot ensure the resilience of coastal areas to heightened erosion and 
an increased frequency, duration and intensity of extreme weather events, the City of Sept-Îles is 
working with the SeptRivières RMC and the Quebec government to come up with a plan for coastal 
procedures (Natural Resources Canada, 2015). This plan will help determine the sectors most at risk 
and consider various scenarios for transferring equipment and infrastructure. 

The procedural plan for emergency management in the Magdalen Islands identifies buildings and 
roads at risk of erosion. It presents scenarios for interventions as well as transferring infrastructure and 
equipment, and identifies potential partners, including the MTMDET. The plan also highlights municipal 
willingness to integrate an “appropriate city regulation” into the city plan (Municipality of the 
Magdalen Islands, 2010).

With respect to fires and their impact on roads, a study on lightning was conducted in Quebec by 
the Canadian Forest Service (Morrissette, 2009). It made it possible to localize events and determined 
that lightning density is higher in the southern and western regions of the province. In 2005, a drought 
resulted in numerous forest fires, forcing the emergency evacuation of nearly 1,000 residents in the 
City of Chibougamau  (Gouvernement du Québec, 2005). The MTMDET collaborated with the Société 
de protection des forêts contre le feu and municipalities in central Quebec to improve knowledge 
regarding climate hazards, including forest fires, and associated transportation vulnerabilities; to 
develop decision-making tools; and, to prepare land-use plans aimed at ensuring the sustainability of 
transportation infrastructure and services.

6.0 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH NEEDS

Transportation networks play a critical role in supporting economic competitiveness and quality of life. 
However, the high level of interdependence among systems renders the challenges associated with 
climate change more complex (Ouranos, 2015). 

Climate change will modify the natural environment in all areas of Quebec. Most of Quebec’s coastal 
areas will experience an increase in erosion, in addition to flooding in areas that were minimally 
affected until now. 

In Nunavik, thawing permafrost contributes to the collapse and cracking of roads and airport 
infrastructure, which are essential to serving the communities (Transport Canada, 2015). Maintenance 
techniques and rehabilitation, as well as the frequency of interventions, must be modified resulting 
in significant additional costs and challenges for planning. In this region of Quebec, changes in ice 
cover and changes in storm regimes also significantly affect winter mobility.  Management of runoff 

 
CHAPTER 7: QUEBEC 

209

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016and drainage are also affected by climate change.  Maps characterizing permafrost areas can 
help to better plan development, and are an important tool to protect infrastructure in this region. 
Many challenges remain in the area of    northern infrastructure adaptation, particularly in relation 
to knowledge transfer, acquisition of long-term data, the use of new technologies to optimize data 
acquisition, and interventions (Transport Canada, 2015).

In urban areas, frequent and more intense rains cause local flooding and will likely increase with 
climate change. A combination of measures would help better manage stormwater issues. 

Extreme weather events appear to pose the greatest risk for infrastructure and transportation systems 
in all seasons. Infrastructure design, along with all aspects of operation, maintenance, management 
and refurbishment is, and will continue to be, affected by climate change.

Adaptation is a social and institutional challenge that should be treated in an integrated fashion. 
The impact of climate change on infrastructure cannot be studied in isolation from other factors 
(social, political, cultural, environmental and economic) that influence infrastructure usage and 
management. Local and global vulnerabilities of the Quebec transportation system must be 
recognized in order to develop relevant adaptation tools and measures that help maintain the 
condition of infrastructure and transportation operations. 

The Quebec government has dedicated considerable efforts over the last two decades to better 
understanding the impact of climate change on the natural environment as well as on transportation 
infrastructure and mobility. The challenges related to storm water management such as bank erosion 
and permafrost thaw are particularly well documented. Strategies to develop solutions to these 
problems are becoming better understood. On the basis of this work, the government has started to 
implement concrete actions to increase overall resilience. Nevertheless, transportation adaptation 
continues to be a subject requiring further research.

There is also a need to better document climate risks to organizations, companies and operating systems. 
Understanding the interaction between natural environmental changes caused by climate change and 
the design, organization and management of transportation systems could benefit from more studies.

With respect to road transportation, more research is need for the coordination between different 
stakeholders and assessments of the impact of climate change on road signalling and peripheral 
equipment, as well as on the use and development of informal roads and corridors in the North.

As for rail transport, few studies were identified. Therefore, it remains difficult to determine specific rail 
transportation challenges in Quebec. 

In the area of marine transportation, there is a need to improve and further document knowledge 
of the vulnerability of infrastructure and marine transportation to climate change, especially in 
southern Quebec. Several themes are worth looking into, such as: assessing premature damage to 
infrastructure associated with climate change; and studying the combined impact of increased 
navigation and climate change on invasive marine species.

With respect to electrical transmission and distribution, the thresholds and tolerance levels of equipment 
and infrastructure to hostile conditions (strong winds, lightning, freezing rain, etc.) need to be determined. 
This can help prevent disruption to communications systems in transportation infrastructure such as the 
fibre optic cables used in the Arcelor Mittal railway damaged due to heavy rain. 

Finally, monitoring the condition of infrastructure relative to a well-documented baseline condition 
would help improve the understanding of potential vulnerabilities, evaluate the performance of 
measures implemented, and intervene in a more intelligent and strategic manner in problem areas. 
Thus, long-term data collection is important both to continue to document the impact of climate 
change, and to define design criteria and best practices for maintenance and management. 
Enhanced knowledge also allows for the exchange of best practices regarding infrastructure design, 
construction and maintenance.

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016KEY FINDINGS 

• 

The climate risks of greatest concern to transportation operators, provincial governments, and 
municipalities in Atlantic Canada are extreme weather events and storm surges. Hurricanes, high 
winds, heavy precipitation, and extreme snowfall have resulted in costly damage and shipping 
disruptions for marine ports, delayed flights and ferry services and washed-out roads and railways. 
As storm frequency and intensity increases, these impacts will likely continue to be severe. 

•  While most actions to enhance the climate resilience of transportation systems have been taken 
in response to past impacts from extreme weather, future climate risks (such as sea level rise) are 
increasingly spurring planning and investments. Coordinated partnerships and initiatives suggest 
Atlantic provinces are actively engaged in adaptation planning. Risk assessments and regional 
cost-benefit analyses, which include transportation systems within their scope, will help inform 
future decision-making.

• 

Transportation practitioners are accounting for projected climate changes in the planning and 
operation of some roads, bridges, railways, and marine ports in Atlantic Canada, but actions 
related to airports are less well-documented. While this is reflective of the dominance of road and 
marine transportation in the region, significant research gaps exist regarding adaptation strategies 
for all modes. 

•  A number of strategies are being specifically used to enhance the resilience of transportation 
infrastructure to flood risks. These include constructing physical barriers (seawalls, breakwaters, 
and dykes), improving stormwater management (updating design flows, enlarging culverts) and 
relocating and/or elevating infrastructure.

•  Regionally-focused weather- and climate-monitoring technologies are helping transportation 

operators identify and adapt to climate risks in Atlantic Canada. Examples include SmartAtlantic 
monitoring buoys to inform extreme-weather preparedness and better understand changes in 
ocean climate, and the Coastal Impact Visualization Environment (CLIVE) tool, which allows 
users to visualize changing coastlines in Prince Edward Island. These technologies assist with risk 
assessment and help practitioners communicate the magnitude of short- and long-term impacts 
to decision-makers.

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 20161.0 INTRODUCTION 

Atlantic Canada includes the provinces of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, 
and Newfoundland and Labrador. While each province has unique geographic and cultural 
characteristics, their shared proximity to the Atlantic Ocean and combined coastlines (exceeding 
40,000 km) (Environment Canada, 2012) result in many common climate vulnerabilities for 
transportation systems. These include risks associated with both extreme weather events (e.g., 
flooding, seasonal storms) and gradual, long-term changes (e.g., sea-level rise, changing patterns of 
temperature and precipitation). Governments and the private sector have recognized the need for 
adaptive action to reduce losses, avoid future costs, and benefit from potential opportunities.

This chapter examines the risks and opportunities for Atlantic Canada’s transportation sector, as well 
as practices to increase its resilience to a changing climate. It addresses all four major transportation 
modes (roads, rail, marine, and air).  

Literature examining the impacts of climate on transportation systems in Atlantic Canada is quite 
limited. Therefore, this chapter draws heavily upon other sources of information, including interviews 
with transportation professionals. This research complements other assessments of climate impacts 
and adaptation for Atlantic Canada as a whole (Vasseur and Catto, 2008) and the Atlantic coast 
more specifically (Savard et al., 2016).

1.1 

ENVIRONMENTAL CHARACTERISTICS

Atlantic Canada has a diversity of landscapes, including five distinct terrestrial ecozones (Environment 
Canada and Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, 1999). Prominent landforms include rugged 
mountains (e.g., the Torngat Mountains in Labrador), fertile valleys (e.g., the Saint John River Valley in 
New Brunswick and the Annapolis Valley in Nova Scotia), and extensive coastlines. The interior regions 
of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland and Labrador are dominated by rolling to rugged 
uplands, and are much more sparsely populated than the coasts. 

Climate regions range from cool humid-continental to Arctic tundra, with the influence of the warm 
Gulf Stream in the south giving way to the cold Labrador Current in the north. Seasonal conditions 
reflect competing tropical and polar, and continental and maritime, influences. The Atlantic coasts 
experience the full range of tropical and extra-tropical storm systems frequently associated with high 
winds, precipitation, and storm surge. 

1.2  DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS

Atlantic Canada is home to approximately 2.4 million people.  The region experienced modest 
population growth from 2006 to 2011 (a provincial average of 2.2 percent), although at lower rates 
than the national average (5.9 percent) (Statistics Canada, 2011). Population shifts within the region 
demonstrate significant migration from rural areas to urban centres, with much greater population 
growth in major cities (see Table 1).

1.3 ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS

The majority of trade in Atlantic Canada is conducted with partners outside of the region – primarily with 
the United States and other provinces, although international markets are becoming more important. 

Almost half of all freight traffic originating from New Brunswick and Nova Scotia is destined for other 
provinces, while less than 25 percent is intra-provincial (Gauthier, 2014). Prince Edward Island shares 
a similar freight pattern, with the majority of exports distributed across Canada. Newfoundland and 
Labrador is more closely connected to global supply chains than other Atlantic provinces, with 
approximately one-third of freight traffic destined for the United States, and one-third destined for the 
rest of the world (Lambert-Racine, 2013).

The Atlantic region is North America’s closest access point to Europe, and major ports in New Brunswick, 
Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland and Labrador play an important role (Canada’s Atlantic Gateway, 
2010). The regional economy is positioned for further growth in global trade, including increasing 
connections with emerging Asian markets through the Suez Canal. These trends are already underway 
– for example, the values of exports from Newfoundland and Labrador to China, the United Kingdom, 
Netherlands and France increased by more than 400 percent from 2010 to 2013 (Newfoundland and 
Labrador Statistics Agency, 2015). As trade activity along many regional and external routes expands, 
transportation operators are working to provide the capacity to meet this demand.  

Key exports from the Atlantic region include crude oil and refined energy products, fish, shellfish, 
minerals, lumber and pulp products, potatoes, and other vegetables. Key imports include many of 
these same commodities, as well as machinery/mechanical parts (Atlantic Canada Opportunities 
Agency, 2012).

2.1 OBSERVED CLIMATE TRENDS

Atlantic Canada’s historic climate record is characterized by high year-to-year variability, as well as 
variability in long-term trends (over several decades) in several key climate parameters. For the period 
1948-2014, mean annual temperature in the Atlantic Canada Climate Region4 increased 0.7°C, similar 
to the global average for the same period and representing the least amount of warming of any 
Canadian region (Environment Canada, 2015a). Increases have also been observed in sea-surface 
temperatures and ocean acidity (Loder et al., 2013). No clear trend is evident for mean annual 
precipitation in the region, although both summer and fall have experienced precipitation increases 
(Mekis and Vincent, 2011).

Of greater interest to Atlantic Canada’s transportation system are changing patterns of extreme 
weather, such as heavy precipitation and seasonal storms. These events increase flood risks (both 
inland and coastal), and exacerbate issues in areas prone to erosion. Due to the rarity of extreme 
weather events, it is difficult to identify trends in the historic record, particularly at the regional scale. 
For example, from 1950-2010 the occurrence of heavy precipitation shows a statistically significant 
increase at some locations in Atlantic Canada, but a decrease at others (Bush et al., 2014). While 
changes in average wind speeds and direction are absent from the historic record, analysis of the 
density of intense storm centres for the period 1961-2000 indicates that Atlantic Canada includes 
some of the stormiest areas in North America (Savard et al., 2016). While the frequency of North 
Atlantic hurricanes shows no long-term significant change (United States Environmental Protection 
Agency, 2015), the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Fifth Assessment Report (2013) and 
the United States Global Change Research Program (2014) note that hurricane intensity has increased 
in the Atlantic region since the 1980s. 

Changes in sea ice cover and sea levels have implications for marine and coastal transportation 
infrastructure. Sea ice coverage has decreased significantly in recent decades, although inter-annual 
variability remains high (Figure 1). Reduced sea-ice cover makes coasts more vulnerable to erosion 
by waves during winter storms. Trends in relative sea level for most of Atlantic Canada, excluding 
Labrador, show slow and steady sea-level rise. This increase is primarily due to glacial isostatic 
adjustment in the Atlantic provinces, referring to the slow vertical land motion or “rebounding” of 
land depressed by hundreds of metres under ice sheets during the most recent ice age (James et al., 
2014). Sea-level rise results in impacts from waves and storm surge at higher coastal sites not previously 
at risk (Atkinson et al., 2016).

and Climate Change Canada) 

2.2 FUTURE CLIMATE PROJECTIONS

Projected changes in climate in Atlantic Canada for the 21st century include continued warming of 
air and water temperatures, as well as increased precipitation. Recent analysis as part of a global 
climate model comparison project5 suggest increases in mean annual temperature of 1°C in the 
near term (2016-2035) to about 3°C by the end of the century. The greatest warming is projected 
to occur in winter. Mean annual precipitation is projected to increase by about 3 percent in the 
near term and almost 10 percent by the end of the century throughout the region, with the greatest 
increases occurring in winter and spring. Snowfall is likely to comprise a reduced proportion of total 
precipitation; the seasonal duration of snow cover will likely decrease (Swansburg et al., 2004); and 
freezing rain events are likely to increase during winter (Cheng et al., 2011). Tables A1-A4 (located 
in the annex of this chapter) present provincially-specific temperature and precipitation projections 
for the Atlantic region to 2100 over three time horizons. Seasonal periods include winter (December-
February), spring (March-May), summer (June-August), and autumn (September-November). Data 
was derived from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) global climate model 
under an ensemble of RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 scenarios (Canadian Climate Data and Scenarios, 
2015). These data reflect uncertainty associated with these projections by presenting a range of 
values from the 25th-75th percentiles of CMIP5 outputs. The median value (50th percentile) appears in 
brackets following the range.

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Global projections forecast an increasing frequency of extreme heat and decreasing frequency of 
extreme cold in Atlantic Canada (Williams and Daigle, 2011). Extreme precipitation events are also 
likely to become more frequent (Swansburg et al., 2004). Significant changes in wind speeds are not 
anticipated, but there is likely to be a northward shift in storm tracks through the current century, 
increasing storm frequency in Atlantic Canada (Loder et al., 2013).

Sea ice will continue to decrease in extent, thickness, concentration, and duration, with models 
projecting that it will be almost completely absent in the Gulf of St. Lawrence by 2100 (Senneville et 
al., 2013).

In areas of Atlantic Canada currently experiencing sea-level rise, the rate of change will accelerate 
throughout the current century. In areas such as Nain, Labrador, where sea level is currently falling 
due to glacial isostatic rebound, sea level will either continue to fall at a slower rate, or it may start 
to rise, depending on the magnitude of change in global mean sea level (James et al., 2014). 
Projections for Atlantic Canada indicate that under a high-emissions scenario, up to 100 cm of 
sea level rise is possible at some locations by 2100 (Figure 2), and that larger increases cannot be 
precluded (Savard et al., 2016; Atkinson et al., 2016). Global mean sea level will continue to rise for 
centuries after 2100, with the magnitude of future changes influenced by the success of efforts to 
reduce global greenhouse gas emissions (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2013).

emissions scenario (RCP8.5; after James et al., 2014). See Atkinson et al. (2016) for additional 
information on sea-level projections, and Savard et al. (2016) for additional details on sites in Atlantic 
Canada. (Source: Natural Resources Canada)

(also referred to as “swash,” the height above the still-water elevation of the sea) and storm surge (the 
difference between observed water level and the predicted astronomical tide, resulting from variations 
in atmospheric pressure and wind). Sea-level rise will result in both more extensive storm-surge flooding, 
and increased frequency of events that contribute to coastal flooding and erosion. For example, 
analysis for Halifax Harbour indicates that a 40 cm rise in sea level by 2050 will yield drastic changes in 
extreme water levels – by mid-century, storm surges which currently have a return period of once in 50 
years are likely to occur (on average) more than once every five years (Forbes et al., 2009).

3.1 ROAD AND RAIL TRANSPORTATION 

Atlantic Canada’s extensive surface transportation infrastructure (road and rail) reflects its regional 
importance in moving people and goods. Each Atlantic province is reliant on roads, while rail 
plays a very significant economic role in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick in the form of the CN Rail 
system that crosses the Chignecto Isthmus.  About $19.5 billion in trade flows annually by rail across 
the Isthmus, which represents about 45% of the total annual trade movements throughout Atlantic 
Canada (Webster et al., 2012; Marlin, 2013). The corridor is the only land connection between Nova 
Scotia and New Brunswick, and is highly vulnerable to storm surge and sea level rise (Figure 4; also see 
Case Study 5). A system of dykes, which includes rail embankments in some stretches, was originally 
built by the Acadians to create agricultural land and currently protects land and rail, road and other 
infrastructure in the Isthmus (Webster et al., 2012). 

A second important rail link in Atlantic Canada is a short section of rail in Labrador that connects to 
the Quebec North Shore and Labrador Railway (QNS & L).  The shipment of iron ore from Labrador 
via the QNS & L represents the largest component of total commercial rail tonnage moving out of 
Atlantic Canada (Stassinu-Stantec Limited Partnership, 2011). Prince Edward Island and the island of 
Newfoundland do not have operational rail lines, while a few independently-owned short-line systems 
operate in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia.

Brunswick-Nova Scotia border. Green depicts especially low-lying areas. The Isthmus separates 
the Bay of Fundy to the southwest from the Northumberland Strait (Gulf of St. Lawrence) to the 
northeast. (Source: Applied Geomatics Research Group, Nova Scotia Community College) 

Large freight volumes are also moved by truck in Atlantic Canada. While the majority is destined for 
other Canadian provinces, a significant portion is also shipped to the United States (crossing primarily 
at Woodstock and St. Stephen, New Brunswick (Transport Canada, 2014). Major highways and 
connector roads also link cities, towns, and provinces in Atlantic Canada (see Figure 5). 

St. John’s, Newfoundland is the easternmost point of the Trans-Canada Highway and joins continental 
Canada via ferry, while a highway to northern Quebec joins Labrador to the rest of the country. 
Prince Edward Island is linked to New Brunswick via the Confederation Bridge. Completed in 1997, the 
12.9 km stretch is the longest bridge in the world over seasonally ice-covered water (Strait Crossing 
Bridge Ltd., 2015) and facilitates the movement of people and goods between the mainland and 
the island year-round. The Trans-Canada Highway connects New Brunswick to Quebec and areas 
west through the most northwestern point of the province, and to Nova Scotia across the Chignecto 
Isthmus).  Trucking accounts for about $500 million in trade flow annually across the Isthmus (Webster 
et al., 2012; Marlin, 2013).

3.2 MARINE TRANSPORTATION 

Each Atlantic province has specialized marine transportation infrastructure. The Port of Halifax is the 
most significant marine hub in Nova Scotia and the third-largest container port in Canada. Its deep, 
ice-free harbour provides services for both international and short-sea shipping, and contributed 
$1.6 billion to the Atlantic economy in 2013 (Port of Halifax, 2015; Cirtwill et al., 2001). The Port also 
features significant intermodal infrastructure, transferring goods to railcars and trucks bound for the 
U.S. Northeast and Midwest, Quebec, and Ontario (Canada’s Atlantic Gateway, 2010). It recently 
completed a $35 million expansion to host wider, post-Panamax6 containerships (Power, 2012).

The Ports of Saint John in New Brunswick and Placentia Bay in Newfoundland also move significant 
volumes of freight, and handle more crude oil and refined petroleum products than Halifax (Canada’s 
Atlantic Gateway, 2010). These products make up the majority of Atlantic Canada’s marine freight, 
much of which originates in Newfoundland. Ferries also play an important role in moving freight (as well 
as people). Marine Atlantic, a crown corporation providing ferry services, accounts for approximately 50 
percent of all goods shipped to and from Canada’s mainland to Newfoundland via Port aux Basques 
and/or Argentia to North Sydney crossings (Marine Atlantic, 2015). 

Marine tourism is another important contributor to the region’s economy, operating at peak capacity 
in summer. The cruise industry is growing in Atlantic Canada, accounting for 31 percent of Canada’s 
total marine passenger traffic in 2012 (Cruise Lines International Association, 2013; Transport Canada, 
2014). The Charlottetown Harbour Authority reports an increase in cruise ship passenger traffic of 
approximately 400% between the years 2007 and 2015 (Corryn Morrissey, Charlottetown Harbour 

6 

  Post-Panamax describes ships that do not fall within the current allowable dimensions for passing through the Panama Canal. 
Operators of the Panama Canal are currently constructing a new lock system, designed to handle these larger “post-Pana-
max” ships.

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Authority, personal communication, 2016). Ferry routes support tourism and regional connectivity. 
In Newfoundland and Labrador, a number of ferry routes travel from Labrador to the island of 
Newfoundland, including St. Barbe-Blanc Sablon and Goose Bay-Cartwright-Lewisporte. Ferries from 
North Sydney, Nova Scotia travel to Newfoundland, while Nova Scotia connects to Prince Edward 
Island via the Caribou-Wood Island Ferry. Other key routes include the Nova Scotia-New Brunswick 
route via Digby to Saint John, and the route operating between Prince Edward Island and Îles de la 
Madeleine, Quebec (Souris to Cap-aux-Meules) (Ferry CTMA, 2015). 

3.3 AIR TRANSPORTATION 

Atlantic Canada’s airports move over 7.8 million people annually, a figure more than three times 
the region’s population size (Atlantic Canada Airports Association, 2012). The airport system includes 
seven National Airports System (NAS)7 airports (below) in addition to many smaller community airports: 

•  Fredericton International Airport, Greater Moncton International Airport, and Saint John Airport 

(New Brunswick); 

•  Gander International Airport, and St. John’s International Airport (Newfoundland and Labrador);

•  Halifax Stanfield International Airport (Nova Scotia); and 

•  Charlottetown Airport (Prince Edward Island).

Less freight is moved by air than by other modes in the Atlantic region – usually only time-sensitive or 
specialty goods. However, freight volumes are still significant, with over 60,000 metric tonnes moved 
annually (Atlantic Canada Airports Association, 2012).

4.0 ROAD TRANSPORTATION: IMPACTS AND ADAPTATIONS

4.1 PAST IMPACTS AND FUTURE RISKS

A number of climate-related variables, including extreme weather events, storm surges, and freeze-
thaw cycles, have impacts on both road infrastructure and operations in Atlantic Canada.

EXTREME EVENTS 

The most severe regional-scale impacts are related to tropical or post-tropical storms, and associated 
with heavy precipitation, strong winds, and storm surges. Examples include Hurricane Juan 
(September 2003), which resulted in $100 million in direct damages to infrastructure in Halifax alone, 
including roads and highways (Bowyer, 2003a), and Hurricanes Earl and Igor, which struck within a 
week of each other in September, 2010 resulting in road closures throughout Atlantic Canada. In 
Newfoundland and Labrador, approximately 150 communities were isolated by road closures during 
Hurricane Igor, and parts of the Trans-Canada Highway were washed away (Canadian Climate 
Forum, 2014). The prospect of more frequent extreme weather events (i.e. shortened return periods) 
will increase the risk of roadway flooding which strands users, increases driving times, disrupts freight 
flows, and can disrupt emergency services (Chu, 2012; Vasseur and Catto, 2008).

Wind gusts from 80-160 km/h have been recorded regionally during tropical and post-tropical storm 
events (Environment Canada, 2013b). High winds have closed major Atlantic bridges such as Halifax’s 
MacDonald Bridge and the Confederation Bridge (Catto et al., 2006). In summer 2014, Hurricane

 The NAS designation is given to airports in provincial capitals and other airports with annual traffic exceeding 200,000 passenger 
movements (Transport Canada, 2010).

could remove the fallen vegetation (Case Study 1). 

High winds also occur independently of tropical storms. For instance, 170 km of highway (from 
Moncton, New Brunswick to Truro, Nova Scotia) through the Chignecto Isthmus has been closed due 
to strong winds and blowing snow (CBC News, 2015a). Also, the stretch of Trans-Canada Highway 
near Wreckhouse, Newfoundland and Labrador often experiences strong winds funnelled from the 
southern end of the Long Range Mountains. Trucking companies in this region use constant-monitoring 
technology to reduce accident risks. One Newfoundland company has reported trucks overturning 
due to high winds in Wreckhouse and the Northern Peninsula (Fleming, 2014).

CASE STUDY 1: HURRICANE ARTHUR’S IMPACTS ON 
TRANSPORTATION IN FREDERICTON 

Fredericton, New Brunswick (population 57,000) is located on a broad sweep of the Saint John River. 
Flooding, from spring freshets and heavy rain events has historically been difficult for Fredericton to 
manage. 

On Saturday July 5, 2014, Hurricane Arthur transformed into a strong post-tropical storm and made landfall 
in western Nova Scotia. Fredericton experienced a prolonged period of heavy rain and high winds from 
the storm system, including 150 mm of rain (recorded at Base Gagetown near Fredericton) and 100 km/h 
wind gusts at Fredericton International Airport. The combination of wind and rain saturated the soil and 
caused widespread tree damage and power outages in the city.

The storm affected roads and sidewalks, the public walking trail network, and Fredericton International 
Airport. City crews struggled to remove trees that had fallen across roadways and trails, disrupting traffic. In 
many cases, electrical lines were intertwined with branches, requiring a joint response from New Brunswick 
Power and the City to clear routes for emergency vehicles. The airport also experienced a lengthy power 
outage and relied on generators to maintain operations. 

Hurricane Arthur was not typical in that it was an early-season tropical storm, hitting Fredericton when 
trees were at their heaviest due to the weight of new leaf growth (and before branches and trunks had 
strengthened to support this growth). More intense and unusual weather events, such as Arthur, have the 
City rethinking standard business practices, including:

•  Planting different tree species and varieties in public rights- of-way to ensure resilience and minimize 

tree failure, which will reduce impacts to the street, trail, and sidewalk system;

• 

Implementing an intensive pruning program to enable trees to withstand severe weather; and

•  Reviewing and upgrading staff training and equipment in anticipation of future storms.     

The City is also working jointly with the University of New Brunswick Forestry program to undertake a street-
tree inventory. Prior to replanting trees, characteristics such as height, root system, canopy, and resilience 
of various species will be assessed to ensure that new trees can better withstand high winds and soil 
saturation. 

This example illustrates the indirect impacts of extreme weather on transportation operations, particularly 
in urban environments. Collaboration across sectors such as electricity, forestry, and transportation is 
important to enhance the resilience of urban systems to climate change.

CHAPTER 8: ATLANTIC CANADA

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Storm surges can cause coastal erosion and flooding, affecting roadways close to shore (Province of 
Nova Scotia, 2009b). The structural integrity of one major bridge in Corner Brook, Newfoundland, has 
nearly been compromised on multiple occasions by storm surges. City officials have been forced to 
close the bridge at times for safety (Rayna Luther, City of Corner Brook Infrastructure and Public Works, 
personal communication, 2015). The segment of Trans-Canada highway in the Chignecto Isthmus is 
also sensitive to storm-surge inundation (see Case Study 5).

In Prince Edward Island, where no point is more than 16 km from the sea, infrastructure is especially 
vulnerable to high-water damage.   For example, a severe storm surge in December 2010 resulted 
in several bridge closures and significant washouts at various locations including Oyster Bed Bridge, 
Corran Ban Bridge and Rustico Bridge (Figure 6).  Additionally, the predominantly sandstone 
composition of Prince Edward Island’s coastline is inherently susceptible to erosion resulting from 
storm surge and high water events.  In Prince Edward Island, at least two coastal public roads have 
been abandoned in recent years, due to erosion (Brian Thompson, Government of Prince Edward 
Island, personal communication, 2016).  This results not only in disruptions to property owners, and 
the traveling public, but in unscheduled government expenditures to secure land and construct 
alternate routes where applicable (Brian Thompson, Government of Prince Edward Island, personal 
communication, 2016).  Coastline erosion rates have been increasing in P.E.I.  The average rate of 
erosion grew from 28 cm per year between 1968 and 2010, to 40 cm per year between 2000 and 2010 
(Webster, 2012).  Without taking into account rising sea levels and increasing storms associated with 
climate change, an assessment of coastal infrastructure in the province identified over 40 kilometres 
of roads at risk from coastal erosion by 2100 (Fenech, 2014).  

The frequency and magnitude of storm-surge flooding will increase over the 21st century in areas that 
experience sea-level rise, including most of Atlantic Canada.  This in turn increases risks to coastal 
roads and bridges.

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016TEMPERATURE AND PRECIPITATION CHANGES

Freeze-thaw cycles are taxing on road systems, particularly when temperature changes are rapid. 
When the frequency of freeze-thaw cycles increases, the potential for rapid road deterioration 
and higher maintenance costs rises as well. For example, by the end of approximately three weeks 
of fluctuating winter conditions in February 2015, Halifax had over 1,000 outstanding potholes – 
approximately 300 were more than two inches deep and therefore assigned a “priority” designation 
(Bradshaw, 2015). These cycles are expected to become more frequent throughout most of the 
Atlantic region over the short term. Freeze-thaw frequency is expected to decline over the long term 
as average winter temperatures rise (Boyle et al., 2013).

Rain-on-snow events also affect Atlantic Canada’s roads. In 1962, approximately 180 mm of rain 
on heavy snow on Prince Edward Island’s southern coast caused extensive washouts and damage 
to paved highways (Atlantic Climate Adaptation Solutions Association, 2011). A similar event in 
December 2014 caused $9 million in damages to bridges and roadways in Prince Edward Island 
(McCarthy, 2014; Wright, 2015). Rapid snow melt can also cause problems for municipal drainage 
systems. When temperatures ranged from -27°C to 7°C in the span of a month in Corner Brook, 
Newfoundland, mass snow-thaws resulted in the infiltration of large water volumes in short periods 
of time, overloading the capacity of stormwater management infrastructure (Rayna Luther, City of 
Corner Brook Infrastructure and Public Works, personal communication, 2015). 

Warmer winters are associated with more frequent freezing rain and black-ice conditions, affecting 
traffic flow, accident rates, maintenance costs, and the use of anti-icing chemicals (Andrey et al., 
2013).  Warmer winter temperatures also affect the safety and usability of informal seasonal ice routes 
in northern Labrador and New Brunswick that provide access to and from communities across frozen 
bodies of water (CBC News, 2012; Nalcor Energy, 2014). 

Extreme temperatures also have negative effects on road infrastructure. Interior regions of New 
Brunswick and Nova Scotia have already experienced an increase in the frequency of hot days, and 
this trend is expected to continue (Steeves, 2013), increasing the risk of road damage and adding 
stress to bridge joints. While extreme cold is not likely to increase in frequency, abnormally cold days 
will continue to occur (Gao et al., 2015), reducing the fuel-efficiency of vehicles and contributing to 
icy conditions. 

4.2 ADAPTATION PRACTICES 

In light of these impacts, governments and private operators are using a number of strategies to 
enhance the resilience of road infrastructure. Flood risks are a particular focus of these efforts.

PHYSICAL PROTECTION MEASURES

Some Atlantic municipalities are constructing seawalls, breakwaters, and dykes to protect roads 
against sea-level rise and higher storm surges (Liverman et al., 1994; Batterson et al., 1999; Halifax 
Regional Municipality, 2012). These buffers protect low-lying infrastructure from overtopping 
(which occurs when water rises higher than a dyke or levee). The construction of higher dykes and 
breakwaters may mediate the impacts of unpredictable flows of water in parts of Atlantic Canada 
(Graham and Musselman, n.d.). Case Study 2 discusses an example of this type of adaptation in 
Halifax, Nova Scotia.

In areas of extreme concern, such as the Chignecto Isthmus corridor, “hardening” of the surrounding 
land by means of a dyke system has protected the roads to date, although further efforts (hard, soft 
and hybrid engineering approaches) to protect infrastructure and communities under projected 
climate scenarios have recently been investigated (see Case Study 5).

CASE STUDY 2: DEFENSIVE ADAPTATION IN COW BAY 
(HALIFAX, NOVA SCOTIA)

The Cow Bay Causeway is a 350 m stretch of road built over a beach of cobble and boulder. For many 
years, despite protection by a breakwater, the road was susceptible to damage from wave overwash. 
Three specific problems were identified with the existing breakwater:

1. 

The breakwater was not high enough in some areas to prevent waves from overtopping. 

2.  Most of the existing armour stone was not of sufficient size to resist the force of waves during a major 

storm; the causeway was closed at least twice a year for safety reasons. 

3.  Voids between the existing armour stones allowed small stones and seaweed to wash through the 

breakwater and be deposited on the roadway.

As a result, the causeway often experienced extensive damage from storms, and required repairs every 
three to five years. The severity and impacts of recent storms (including Hurricane Juan in 2003, post-
tropical storm Noel in 2007, and a January 2010 storm) and risks of future impacts prompted the Halifax 
Regional Municipality to commission a study and recommendations for the redesign of the causeway and 
its breakwater. The study employed a statistical risk assessment model known as the Coastal Infrastructure 
Adaptation Planning System (CIAPS) to analyze the interaction of future tidal and storm-surge conditions 
along the coast with the anticipated performance of the existing breakwater, as well as to determine the 
appropriate elevations for more resilient infrastructure (Davies et al., 2010). Four adaptation alternatives 
were identified:

1.  Erosion-proofing the causeway by replacing gravel shoulders with articulated concrete mats;

2.  Erosion-proofing, plus elevating the roadway to minimize overtopping risks;

3.  Rebuilding the barrier in its entirety (including impermeable technologies); or

4.  Rebuilding the barrier in prioritized phases (Davies et al., 2010).

The risk assessment suggested that the cost-optimized solution was to rebuild the causeway’s breakwater in 
two phases. The design included:

•  An increase in the height of the breakwater; 

•  A 600 mm-by-2.5 m concrete core;  

•  4-to-8-tonne armour stone on the outer face of the breakwater; 

•  A breakwater crest approximately 9 m wide; and

•  A seaward slope (two blocks horizontal for one block vertical). 

Each phase included completion of approximately half of the breakwater length, and the design allowed 
for the increase in wave height anticipated under future sea-level and storm-surge conditions. The project 
was tendered in 2012, and Phase 1 was awarded with a budgeted construction cost of $670,000 (Davies et 
al., 2010; Halifax Regional Municipality, 2012). Phase 2 was completed in 2013. 

While the new breakwater has not yet dealt with a major hurricane event, local practitioners suggest that 
the infrastructure has been successful in mitigating the effects of heavy storms and wave action to date 
(David Hubley, Halifax Regional Municipality, personal communication, 2016).

Written by Eric Rapaport with input from David Hubley (Halifax Regional Municipality). 

STORMWATER MANAGEMENT PRACTICES

Throughout Atlantic Canada, cities are reducing risks to roadways from flood events by improving 
stormwater management practices. These include: 

•  using future climate projections to update design flows in stormwater management networks to 

account for increased precipitation. Examples include the City of Fredericton, New Brunswick 
(Arisz, n.d.), the City of Corner Brook, Newfoundland (City of Corner Brook, 2012), and the Town of 
Stratford, Prince Edward Island (CBCL Ltd., 2012).

•  using the Public Infrastructure Engineering Vulnerability Committee’s (PIEVC) risk assessment 
protocol to assess the climate change vulnerability of roads and stormwater management 
systems. Examples include Sandy Point, Nova Scotia; Miramichi, New Brunswick; and, Placentia, 
Newfoundland and Labrador (Municipality of the District of Shelburne, 2011; City of Miramichi, 
2013; Engineers Canada, 2014). In response to PIEVC recommendations, Sandy Point is investing in 
new pumping stations to reduce infiltration and flows onto infrastructure, and both Miramichi and 
Placentia are considering larger culvert sizes along the road corridors that were assessed (City of 
Miramichi, 2013; Engineers Canada, 2014).

Additional stormwater management practices identified in the literature may also be relevant 
to Atlantic Canada.  These include building rain gardens/retention ponds; using permeable 
pavement materials; planting trees (to increase infiltration and reduce water pooling on roads), and 
coordinating stormwater management at the watershed-scale (i.e. maintaining natural river channels 
and wetlands) (Marsalek and Schreier, 2010; Kessler, 2011).

 
CHAPTER 8: ATLANTIC CANADA

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016INFRASTRUCTURE RELOCATION 

Relocating or flood-proofing road infrastructure may be required, where the shoreline is at risk of 
being inundated or unusable, due to sea-level rise, storm surges, and coastal erosion (Transportation 
Research Board, 2008; Davidson-Arnott and Ollerhead, 2011). Some municipalities in Atlantic Canada 
have chosen to locate new roads away from coastal areas (Graham and Musselman, n.d.); or 
elevate infrastructure when feasible (i.e. Moncton, New Brunswick; see Chapter 9) (AMEC Inc., 2011). 
For example:

• 

• 

The Confederation Bridge, which connects PEI to the Canadian mainland in New Brunswick, was 
built to accommodate a one metre rise in sea levels over 100 years.  The bridge was also designed 
to allow ice blocks to pass safely underneath (Gregg, 2010). 

The Prince Edward Island Department of Transportation is rebuilding the Souris bridge one metre 
higher, due to sea level rise projections (Government of Prince Edward Island, 2015). 

•  Nova Scotia’s provincial government recently rebuilt its 100-series highways further inland from 

their original coastal locations to provide safer and faster corridors; as a result, these highways are 
much less sensitive to coastal hazards (Finck, 2013).

• 

The New Brunswick Department of Transportation rebuilt and raised a bridge on the main road into 
Pointe-du-Chêne to accommodate future sea-level rise (Daigle, 2011). 

•  Relocation of the section of Trans-Canada Highway along the Chignecto Isthmus has been 

discussed as a potential long-term adaptation solution, but is presently considered too costly (see 
Case Study 5).

OPERATIONAL AND MAINTENANCE PRACTICES

Operators are also adapting to challenging weather conditions. For example, one trucking company 
in Newfoundland, experiencing more frequent repairs due to difficult road and weather conditions, 
has found a creative way to ensure business continuity (Fleming, 2014). Towing trucks to the 
company’s facility in Corner Brook is expensive and time consuming; therefore, the company now 
strategically leaves replacement parts in customers’ homes and businesses along its routes (Fleming, 
2014). When minor repairs are required (i.e. tires, springs, and lights), drivers contact the closest facility 
to request delivery or replacement of the appropriate parts. The company’s connections to local 
communities make this approach possible.

Governments are investing in proactive maintenance to reduce climate risks to transportation 
infrastructure. For instance, to reduce spring flood risks in rural New Brunswick resulting from periods 
of rapid warming and snowmelt, the federal government invested $1.7 million in 2015 to proactively 
remove snow from the roadways of eight vulnerable First Nations communities. As many as 800 
truckloads of snow per day were removed from critical infrastructure (including roadways) in some 
communities. Regional snowfall in winter 2014 broke local records and contained higher-than-normal 
water content, making snow difficult for communities to remove (Water Canada, 2015; Aboriginal and 
Northern Development Canada, 2015).

5.1 PAST IMPACTS AND FUTURE RISKS 

Rail infrastructure in Atlantic Canada is affected by a changing climate and extreme weather in 
many of the same ways as roads. For example, flooding (caused by extreme precipitation, storm 
surge, and ice jams) has resulted in impacts on both modes (Environment Canada, 2010), and 
snowstorms that inundated roadways in St. John’s, Newfoundland in 1959 and Prince Edward Island in 
1989 also buried and stranded trains (Environment Canada (2013b). 

STORM SURGE, COASTAL EROSION, AND SEA-LEVEL RISE

Coastal rail lines in Atlantic Canada are vulnerable to flooding, washouts, and damage associated 
with storm surge and erosion, which can sometimes result in derailments. For example, in 2003 
Hurricane Juan resulted in 1.5-2 m storm surges at Halifax Harbour that severely eroded shoreline, 
washed-out railway tracks (Figure 8), and washed several rail cars into the ocean at the Dartmouth 
rail yard (Bowyer, 2003a). Similarly, Hurricane Igor in 2010 caused rail-line damage, washout, and 
closures – these were especially pronounced in Newfoundland (Curtis and Ehrenfeld, 2012).

above the highest water level recorded at the Halifax tide gauge across the harbor, and water 
levels remained unusually high at the time of photography. (Source: Natural Resources Canada) 

 
CHAPTER 8: ATLANTIC CANADA 

237
237

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016In 1974, a wind storm accompanied by high seas washed-out 30 m of railway track and derailed 
two diesel trains at Cape Ray, Newfoundland (Heritage Newfoundland and Labrador, n.d.). Coastal 
erosion has resulted in damaged tracks, slower speeds, operational delays, and rail closures in Atlantic 
Canada, affecting the movement of goods such as paper, coal, lumber, petroleum products, and 
chemicals (Genesee and Wyoming, Inc., n.d.). These disruptions have negative impacts on local 
industries (including intermodal facilities) due to delayed shipping, production, and refinement, and 
foregone profits/revenues. 

Slope failures in coastal areas have affected the Quebec North Shore and Labrador Railway (QNS & 
L) (Batterson et al., 1999; CBC News, 2014b), and will continue to pose risks in future (Spooner et al., 
2013; Evan et al., 2005).  Similarly, the Cape Jack section of the Cape Breton and Central Nova Scotia 
Railway (CBNS) has experienced severe erosion around coastal sections of track (Stephen Newson, 
Province of Nova Scotia, personal communication, 2015; CBC News, 2014a).  

Looking forward, an area of considerable concern is the Chignecto Isthmus, which is vulnerable to 
flooding and where flood risks will increase significantly throughout the 21 century as a result of sea-
level rise (Webster et al., 2011) (Figure 9; see Case Study 5).

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016EXTREME PRECIPITATION

There are many documented incidents of heavy precipitation events affecting rail transport in 
Atlantic Canada. For example, on August 31, 2007, heavy rain caused a number of culverts to fail 
along CBNS rail in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, as well as wash-outs along many sections. The track 
was closed for approximately three weeks for repair and replacement, disrupting freight movement 
(Stephen Newson, Province of Nova Scotia, personal communication, 2015). In total, the incident cost 
the railway more than $500,000 (Province of Nova Scotia, 2007a, 2007b).  

In April 2003, culverts beneath a rail line in Ellershouse, Nova Scotia washed out during a large storm 
event (Stephen Newson, Province of Nova Scotia, personal communication, 2015). Similarly a severe 
tropical storm in December 2010 caused significant damage to rail infrastructure near Fredericton, 
New Brunswick, as extreme precipitation washed-out rail bridges and undermined rail beds 
(Environment Canada, 2013c). Future increases in the intensity, duration, and frequency of extreme 
precipitation (Bush et al., 2014) would result in even more severe impacts.

Heavy snow also disrupts rail movements in Atlantic Canada. For instance, snowstorms in Nova Scotia 
during winter 2015 delayed the movement of goods and services by rail from multimodal facilities to 
North American markets, proving costly for operators (Henderson, 2015; Cuthbertson, 2015). Heavy 
snow will continue to affect rail movements in Atlantic Canada, at least over the short term. 

ICE-JAM FLOODING

Inland flooding associated with snowmelt and ice jams8 have caused major damage to rail systems. 
Floods involving ice jams tend to be more damaging to infrastructure than open-water events, 
particularly to bridges. For example, during a February 1970 flood on the Saint John River, New 
Brunswick, a series of ice jams on six rivers resulted in the destruction of 32 bridges (both road and rail) 
and damage to 124 others (see Figure 10) (Government of New Brunswick, 2012).

Figure 10: Spring ice jam at a rail bridge on the Saint John River. (Source: New Brunswick Power, 2015)

8 

  An ice jam is a temporary ice blockage of a river, formed by the accumulation of ice fragments that build up to restrict the 
flow of water. Ice jams form during both the freeze-up and breakup periods, but it is usually breakup jams that have the greater 
flooding potential. Over two thirds of total provincial flood damage costs in the Saint John River basin are due to ice-related 
events (Environment Canada, 2013a). 

 
CHAPTER 8: ATLANTIC CANADA 

239
239

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016In April 1987, an ice jam caused the collapse of the Perth-Andover railway bridge, during a severe 
spring flooding event in New Brunswick. Loaded rail cars had been placed on the bridge to 
hold back the ice jam and prevent flooding downstream, a practice that had been successfully 
employed during a less-severe spring flood event in 1976; however in 1987, the pressure of the ice and 
floodwaters caused the bridge to fail (Environment Canada, 2010). In future, the likelihood of ice-jam 
flooding may increase as the timing of seasonal change becomes more variable from year to year 
(Government of New Brunswick, 2014). 

TEMPERATURE 

Increasing average air temperatures and changing extremes pose uncertain risks to rail transportation 
in Atlantic Canada. Hot and cold temperature extremes cause rail tracks to expand or contract, and 
can lead to train derailments (Dobney et al., 2008; Peterson et al., 2008; Nova Scotia Department of 
Transportation and Infrastructure Renewal, 2014). Extreme summer heat can result in rails buckling as 
they expand beyond reasonable design limits (Dobney et al., 2008), causing “sun kinks”. Historically 
this has not been a common problem in the Atlantic provinces (Stephen Newson, Province of Nova 
Scotia, personal communication, 2015). However, the region has experienced incidents caused by, 
or exacerbated by, rapid temperature changes. For example, the investigation into a derailment in 
Pictou County, Nova Scotia in June 2014 indicated that track buckling “produced by a sudden and 
unusual fluctuation of rail temperature and accumulated steel stress” was a significant contributor 
(Province of Nova Scotia, 2014). Extreme temperature change is also considered to have been a 
major factor in a main-track derailment in Milford, Nova Scotia in 2002 (Transportation Safety Board of 
Canada, 2003). The frequency of these events – and the probability of a serious accident – is likely to 
increase as temperatures rise in the 21st century (Dobney et al., 2008).

5.2 ADAPTATION PRACTICES

While documented examples are limited, rail operators in Atlantic Canada have made efforts to 
reduce future climate risks. For example, an emergency culvert and aboiteaux9 system in Hantsport, 
Nova Scotia was constructed to accommodate increased water flow through culvert systems under rail 
tracks (Figure 11). The overflow openings allow excess water during extreme precipitation or flooding 
situations to drain from the culvert via an alternate route. This prevents culvert blowouts during periods 
of heavy flow (Stephen Newson, Province of Nova Scotia, personal communication, 2015).

Figure 11: Overflow aboiteaux at Hantsport, Nova Scotia. (Source: Danika Van Proosdij)

 This refers to a series of protective dykes around low-lying farmland to prevent tidal inundation (Hatvany, 2002).

 
CHAPTER 8: ATLANTIC CANADA 

240
240

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016In the past, the general solution to erosion under rail lines was to replace fallen or sunken rock. 
However, due to the increasing frequency of repairs and associated costs, this method may no longer 
be sufficient or effective (Stephen Newson, Province of Nova Scotia, personal communication, 2015). 
Physical barriers, such as dykes have also been used to protect rail infrastructure from the effects of 
storm-surge flooding, and erosion, but these protections may not be sufficient in future. Adaptation 
options are currently being examined for dyke systems in the Chignecto Isthmus, for example (Case 
Study 5). 

One practice that has been used to increase the resilience of rail infrastructure vulnerable to 
temperature extremes is to replace continuously welded rail (CWR) with shorter segments, which have 
joints allowing track to expand and contract (Lim et al., 2003). (CWR, which has longer rail segments, 
generally reduces track maintenance costs and increases the average service life of rail components 
under moderate temperature conditions). For example, following the June 2014 derailment in Pictou, 
300 feet of CWR from the point of derailment was replaced with 39-foot track panels that are easier to 
maintain and replace in the event of stress caused by heat or temperature fluctuations. Additionally, 
the company conducted a stress test on the rail line, and employees reviewed rail maintenance 
requirements. To prevent similar events in the future, the railway has developed a new technical 
training program, and train speeds have been restricted to 40 km/h during summer months and may 
be further restricted to as low as 16 km/h when warranted by extreme heat conditions (Province of 
Nova Scotia, 2014). 

6.0 MARINE TRANSPORTATION

6.1 PAST IMPACTS AND FUTURE RISKS 

Marine transportation in Atlantic Canada has long been affected by adverse climate conditions 
and storms, disrupting operations and damaging vessels, ports, and navigation infrastructure. 
These impacts are particularly challenging for Newfoundland and Labrador, which relies heavily 
on marine transportation for resupply and connectivity (CBC News, 2015b, 2015c). Over the past 
century, improved forecasting and monitoring technologies have considerably reduced risks to 
marine operators from extreme weather. However, ports and vessels remain vulnerable to a number 
of future risks associated with a changing climate. Lost productivity from weather-related disruptions 
in Atlantic Canada’s marine transportation sector is estimated to total millions of dollars annually 
(Catto et al., 2006).

PRECIPITATION, EXTREME WEATHER, STORM SURGE, AND SEA-LEVEL RISE

Hurricanes have caused major damage to marine infrastructure and vessels in the past. During 
Hurricane Juan,  storm surges of 1.5-2 m and wind gusts up to 230 km/h, damaged coastal wharves and 
other port infrastructure in Halifax Harbour, blew containers off ships, snapped weather buoys, and sank 
and damaged vessels (Bowyer, 2003a Bowyer, 2003b). “White Juan”, a hurricane-force nor’easter in 
February 2004 (five months after the hurricane), resulted in 10-15 m waves and a storm surge that further 
damaged ports in Nova Scotia (Environment Canada, 2013a). In 1995, during Hurricane Luis, a 30 m 
wave struck an ocean liner off the coast of Newfoundland (Environment Canada, 2013b). 

Rising sea levels and increased storm surge are also expected to pose greater risks over the course 
of the 21st century (Bush et al., 2014). Sea-level rise in the range of 70-100 cm is projected for many 
key coastal locations in Atlantic Canada by 2100 (Savard et al., 2016); and in some cases, higher 
tides and storm surges could inundate and damage wharves, terminals, and loading equipment in 
the absence of adaptive action (Andrey and Mills, 2003). Figures 12a and 12b illustrate the extent of 
possible inundation for Halifax Harbour in 2100, based on two sea-level rise scenarios (high- and low-
probability). In some locations sea-level rise could permit the entry of ships with greater drafts and 
heavier cargo loads (Andrey and Mills, 2003).

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016SEA ICE AND WIND

High winds have been a source of costly delays for ferries servicing Newfoundland, Labrador, and 
Nova Scotia (CBC News, 2015b; Cape Breton Post, 2015; Catto et al., 2006). When combined with 
earlier seasonal break-up and fragmentation of sea ice, winds pose additional navigation hazards. 
For instance, in the winter of 2015, ice blown into the Strait of Belle Isle resulted in lengthy delays and 
frustration for passengers attempting to travel between Newfoundland and Labrador (CBC News, 
2015b). Similarly, increasing easterly wind strength in Channel-Port aux Basques, Newfoundland may 
threaten the reliability of ferry transportation in the area, an important crossing point from the island to 
the mainland (Catto et al., 2006).

High winds will continue to pose risks to vessels and ports, based on projected increases to the 
frequency of extreme weather events. At the same time, warmer summer weather and the 
decreasing extent and duration of sea ice will offer potential benefits to commercial shipping, the 
cruise industry, and eco-tourism via an extended Maritime shipping season (Andrey and Mills, 2003; 
Leys, 2009; Savard et al., 2016).

CASE STUDY 3: PLANNING FOR FUTURE EXTREME WEATHER 
CONDITIONS AT HALIFAX HARBOUR

The Province of Nova Scotia, with support from Natural Resources Canada has been conducting a 
case study on the impacts of climate change on coastal transportation infrastructure in Halifax Harbour. 
Researchers are using cost-benefit analysis to assess vulnerabilities to changing climate parameters and 
adaptation options. Analysis focuses on marine shipping and intermodal transfers to truck and rail. This 
includes an investigation of how rail delays resulting from extreme weather or infrastructure damage might 
affect the delivery of goods to marine ports. The results of this study were not yet available at the time of 
writing this assessment. 

Variables under consideration in the study included sea-level rise, storm surge, and coastal subsidence. 
Maps and computer models were used to visualize potential impacts on the system. Volunteer participants 
in the study included CN rail and major port operators. This cost-benefit analysis will help to demonstrate 
the impacts of climate change on businesses near Halifax Harbour. 

Written with input from Shawn MacDonald (Climate Change Unit, Government of Nova Scotia). 

6.2 ADAPTATION PRACTICES

Atlantic Canada’s marine ports and operators have employed a number of practices to improve 
their resilience to climate and extreme weather risks. One example is Bay Bulls Harbour (Figure 13), 
an economic hub in eastern Newfoundland that is proximate to St. John’s and the productive 
fishing grounds of the Grand Banks. In 2010, Hurricane Igor caused extensive damage to the wharf.  
When the wharf was reconstructed, the community elected to include adaptive measures to better 
withstand future storm conditions. Sea-level rise, storm surges, and extreme weather were considered. 
As a result, the new wharf was built 0.5 m higher than previously, its directional orientation was 
changed, and a breakwater of 1.5 m was constructed to provide increased protection. Bay Bulls 
and its economic assets are now better-prepared for higher-intensity weather conditions (Office of 
Climate Change, Energy Efficiency and Emissions Trading, 2013). There are an increasing number of 
cost/benefit analyses demonstrating that capital and other expenditures undertaken to reduce risks 
of infrastructure damage result in long-term cost savings (see Case Study 5).

Institute of Memorial University)  

An under-explored area of adaptation is the application of new technologies to reduce climate 
risk.  For example, the Fisheries and Marine Institute of Memorial University of Newfoundland and 
the Institute for Ocean Research Enterprise of Halifax have created the SmartAtlantic Alliance 
to further modernize Canada’s marine navigation system by providing accurate and real-time 
meteorological and hydrological data. Data generated by SmartAtlantic buoys (Figure 14) is used 
to produce high-resolution forecasts of weather and sea conditions, and for scientific research. 
The technology is currently in use at seven Atlantic ports (see Case Study 4) and allows the 
marine transportation industry, commercial and recreational boaters, researchers, and interested 
members of the public to access real-time, online data about regarding weather and directional 
wave information at these locations. It is designed to optimize efficiency without compromising 
navigational safety, and to enhance the reliability of port operations in a variety of weather and 
climatic conditions (Government of Canada, 2014; New Brunswick Department of Transportation 
and Infrastructure, 2015).

CASE STUDY 4: CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION AT PORT 
SAINT JOHN

Port Saint John is Atlantic Canada’s largest port by tonnage. It connects global markets to central Canada 
by rail and road, and serves regionally-important industries such as potash, petroleum, and tourism (i.e. 
the cruise industry). Climate-related impacts and disruptions to the port’s operations negatively affect 
the regional and national economy, as well as the Port’s profitability. Port operators have identified a 
number of risks to infrastructure and operations related to extreme, variable and/or changing climatic 
conditions. Spring flooding has been particularly problematic. 

Sea-level rise and storm surges pose increasing risks to port infrastructure, designed for a 100-year lifespan. 
In late 2015-early 2016, Port Saint John experienced an unusually high number of strong wind events, 
producing storm surges in the inner harbour. During one particularly strong event on October 29, 2015 
(the peak of which coincided with an extra high tide), infrastructure sustained approximately $20,000 in 
damages (Chris Hall, Port Saint John, personal communication, 2016).

Several actions, implemented and planned by the Port as part of its modernization efforts, are expected to 
make the port more resilient to variable and changing climatic conditions, and more reliable for shippers 
and mariners. For example, the “SmartAtlantic” inshore weather buoy was recently launched, along with a 
wave forecasting tool. Figure 15 provides an example of the forecasting output from Saint John Harbour’s 
SmartAtlantic buoy. This data accurately predicted the storm-surge event on October 29, 2015.

The Port is also undertaking long-term planning for its infrastructure as part of a port modernization plan. A 
preliminary engineering study in support of these efforts explicitly accounted for future sea level rise, based 
on high-resolution models for the Upper Bay of Fundy (Dupont et al., 2005).

7.0 AIR TRANSPORTATION

7.1 PAST IMPACTS AND FUTURE RISKS

Practitioners suggest that on the whole, airports in the Atlantic region are well-equipped to function 
during difficult weather conditions. However, extreme weather events and storms, including heavy 
rain, snowfall, and strong winds, can result in flight delays and cancellations, associated economic 
losses, and passenger inconvenience. Flight delays are especially problematic for Newfoundland 
(CBC News, 2015b, 2015c), which relies on aviation (as well marine transportation) for connectivity. 

Airports aim to keep facilities open in all weather conditions, especially for medical emergency 
services that require the use of runways and airport facilities. The challenge for airports is to provide 
efficiency of service while ensuring safe operations during extreme weather conditions. Atlantic 
airports are particularly concerned with rising operating costs accompanying more variable 
and severe weather conditions (Helen MacInnis, J.A. Douglas McCurdy Sydney Airport, personal 
communication, 2015; Andrew Isbill, Fredericton Airport Authority, personal communication, 2015). 

PRECIPITATION AND STORMS

Precipitation, including rain, snow, and freezing rain on runways can compromise the friction and 
visibility necessary for planes to take off and land. Operational costs can also rise significantly in 
response to freezing rain events and extreme snowfall (Helen MacInnis, J.A. Douglas McCurdy Sydney 
Airport, personal communication, 2015). 

Increasingly frequent storm events (and associated precipitation and flooding) in the 21st century 
could lead to further losses in revenue due to operational disruptions. These types of delays could also 
increase operating costs, associated with requirements for more aircraft, facility maintenance and the 
improvement of supporting infrastructure, such as access roads and drainage facilities (Transportation 
Research Board, 2008). 

While storm surges, erosion and sea-level rise pose risks to regional coastal infrastructure, most airports 
in Atlantic Canada are built on relatively high ground, which reduces vulnerability to coastal flooding. 

Drainage systems are usually effective in reducing flood risks to runways. However, extreme 
precipitation events have, in some instances, flooded airport service/access roads and parking lots in 
Atlantic Canada. In some cases, these floods have delayed and cancelled flights, as was the case at 
Halifax Stanfield International Airport during a strong nor’easter in December 2014 (CBC News, 2014c). 

Increased frequency of lightning storms and hurricanes are also a concern for some airports in Atlantic 
Canada, given their potential to disrupt operations and pose safety risks (for instance, by reducing 
visibility during landing and take-off). While data to support the increasing frequency of these storms are 
not captured in the historical record, Sydney airport has documented an increase in frequency over the 
short term (Helen MacInnis, J.A. Douglas McCurdy Sydney Airport, personal communication, 2015). 

 
CHAPTER 8: ATLANTIC CANADA 

246
246

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016WIND 

High winds can result in cancelled, delayed or redirected flights when cross winds are too strong for 
aircraft to safely take off or land (United Kingdom Department for Transport, 2014). Wind can also 
damage equipment on the ground. For instance, in 2012, high winds tipped over an array (part of 
the instrument landing system) at the J.A. Douglas McCurdy Sydney Airport in Nova Scotia, affecting 
landing operations and requiring NAV CANADA to make unexpected and costly repairs (Helen 
MacInnis, J.A. Douglas McCurdy Sydney Airport, personal communication, 2015). 

Power outages accompanying windstorms can create major problems for air transportation. For 
example, when Hurricane Arthur hit the Maritimes in the summer of 2014, Fredericton International 
Airport lost power and had to rely on a backup generator (Andrew Isbill, Fredericton Airport Authority, 
personal communication, 2015). The generator allowed the airport to continue with some operations, 
although operators had concerns about its potential failure. More frequent high-intensity wind events 
would increase risks associated with these impacts, although projections indicate that daily average 
wind speeds are not likely to increase significantly in the Atlantic region (Loder et al., 2013).

TEMPERATURE 

Atlantic aviation is also vulnerable to changing temperatures. Increasing freeze-thaw cycles pose 
risks to runway stability, while extreme heat and cold reduce aircraft engine performance and fuel 
efficiency (Transportation Research Board, 2008).

Increasing turbulence as a result of higher-temperature conditions (increased air density) is expected 
to affect flights in the North Atlantic by mid-century. The proportion of flight time for transatlantic 
journeys spent in conditions of “moderate-or-greater turbulence” is likely to increase 40-170 percent 
by mid-century, resulting in longer trip times, greater fuel consumption, and more greenhouse-gas 
emissions (Williams and Joshi, 2013). 

7.2 ADAPTATION PRACTICES

Adaptation actions at Atlantic airports are not well documented in the public domain. However, 
Atlantic aviation faces many of the same climate risks as operators in other Canadian jurisdictions 
(including extreme weather events and temperature extremes). Thus, many of the practices outlined 
in other chapters of this report apply to Atlantic Canada. General risk avoidance practices include 
standard procedures for accessing weather forecasts and planning flights, and for advanced aircraft 
instrumentation systems. 

8.0 MULTI-MODAL RISK ASSESSMENTS AND COST-BENEFIT ANALYSES 

Some initiatives in Atlantic Canada have considered the vulnerability of the region’s transportation 
network with a multimodal lens. These include risk assessments and cost-benefit analyses of climate 
change impacts and adaptation options for transportation infrastructure.

8.1 RISK ASSESSMENTS

In 2012, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) completed an expert-based risk assessment 
of infrastructure, waterways, and biological systems in the Atlantic Large Aquatic Basin (LAB), 
which includes the Newfoundland Labrador Shelf, Scotian Shelf/Slope, and the Gulf of Maine 
(Department of Fisheries and Oceans, 2013). The assessment process identified and rated six key 
risks based on “risk exposure” (vulnerability to impacts) on 10- and 50-year horizons. Risks relevant 
to transportation include increased demand for emergency services, infrastructure damage, and 

 
CHAPTER 8: ATLANTIC CANADA 

247
247

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016changes to the navigability of waterways. Of these, it was determined that the greatest risks are 
posed to infrastructure by changing climate conditions over both timescales. Authors note that this 
assessment’s methodology can be applied to smaller-scale risk assessments of ports and coastal 
transportation systems in Atlantic Canada.

Public and private institutions are developing tools to assist in the assessment of climate change risks. 
For example, the “CoastaL Impact Visualization Environment” (CLIVE) tool, created in partnership 
by the University of Prince Edward Island (UPEI) and Simon Fraser University, offers a “virtual tour” of 
likely coastal erosion and storm-surge impacts on Prince Edward Island. CLIVE is operated by a game 
controller and allows the user to “fly” over Prince Edward Island’s coastline, examining past and future 
sea levels (at 30, 60, and 90 year future intervals). This tool also quantifies sea-level rise risks, including 
land area lost. This tool is useful for assessing transportation infrastructure vulnerability to coastal 
changes in order to better plan for changes in maintenance, structure, or location over the short and 
long term (Office of the Vice-President, Research, 2015).

8.2 COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS 

Some practitioners in the region are undertaking cost-benefit analyses of adaptation options in order 
to ensure the benefits of a given option outweighs the costs associated with climate change. The 
costs of direct (damages) and indirect (disruptions and closures) climate impacts on transportation 
systems can be significant. At the same time, adaptation efforts can be costly – infrastructure is 
expensive to build, and changing operational practices can cause short-term delays, confusion, and 
other inefficiencies (Füssel, 2007). Case Study 5 summarizes a cost-benefit analysis of climate impacts 
and adaptation options for the Chignecto Isthmus.

CASE STUDY 5: ADAPTING TO FLOODING AND STORM-SURGE  
RISKS IN THE CHIGNECTO ISTHMUS

The Chignecto Isthmus is one of Canada’s most important transportation corridors, and the sole land 
bridge joining mainland Canada (New Brunswick) with Nova Scotia. Marsh areas within the Isthmus had 
dykes installed in the 1700s for agriculture. Since that time, significant infrastructure has been built within this 
area, including the Trans-Canada Highway, the CN Railway, and electricity-transmission lines serving Nova 
Scotia. Trade through the Isthmus is conducted by both road and rail, carrying an estimated value of $50 
million per day and $20 billion annually. 

Recent studies demonstrate the vulnerability of the region to sea-level rise and storm-surge flooding 
(Webster et al., 2011, Lieske and Bornemann, 2012; and Webster et al., 2012). By 2100, 38 km of dykes, 19 km 
of rail, and 19 km of the Trans-Canada Highway could be severely affected by flooding in a 1-in-100 year 
storm event (Figure 16). However, there has been a lack of information on the economic costs associated 
with these impacts in the Chignecto region. 

A collaborative cost-benefit analysis (CBA) of adaptation options (including maintaining the status quo) 
was undertaken to assess the economic consequences of sea-level rise and storm surge on significant 
infrastructure (highways, rail, agricultural dykes, and electricity) and trade in the Isthmus. The project 
features collaboration among the Provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia and Natural Resources 
Canada. The CBA had three objectives:

•  Build on existing local assessments of climate change impacts and adaptation options, adding 

economic analysis to the discussion. 

•  Quantify economic costs associated with flood-related damages to the transportation corridor in order 

to demonstrate the benefits (monetary and otherwise) associated with potential adaptation options. 

• 

Support decision-makers in the selection of informed adaptation investments.

Six adaptation options were assessed (see Table 3). These options mainly focus on changes that could be 
made to the management of agricultural dykes in the Isthmus, which currently protect farmland against 
tidal flooding, and provide secondary protection for roads, rail, and infrastructure. However, the dykes 
are not designed to withstand severe storm events. Summaries of adaptation options are presented 
below. A key assumption in the study was that no option could result in increased risks or damages to the 
communities and municipal infrastructure of Sackville and Amherst.

Description

Raising/topping-up dykes in existing locations to 10 m. Public 
infrastructure not protected behind dykes.
Combination: Topping-up dykes and rebuilding to 10 m in existing 
locations, but shortened in certain sections. Raise infrastructure.
Build engineered dykes on top of existing dykes, engineered to 2070, 
1-in-100-year events (10 m).
Shorten dykes, build engineered dykes on top of existing dykes, as well 
as new stretches, engineered to 2070, 1-in-100-year events (10 m); 
raise rail that is not being protected by existing dykes.
Shorten dykes, build engineered dykes on top of existing dykes, as well 
as new stretches, engineered to 2070, 1-in-100-year events (10 m).

Re-route a vulnerable 50 km stretch of the Trans-Canada Highway.

The CBA is a high-level analysis intended to provide strategic direction on adaptation options – not to 
inform operational-level decision-making or costing. 

The cost of impacts associated with climate change over the period from 2015 to 2064 in today’s dollars is 
estimated at $124 million. When potential trade loss is incorporated, this cost rises to $435 million. 

The preferred adaptation option is an approach involving engineered dykes designed to protect against 
flooding associated with a 1-in-100 year storm event in 2070 (Option 3). Dykes would be shortened 
(compared to their current length) and protect all infrastructure (road, rail and electricity). The cost of 
the preferred option is estimated at approximately $93 million and its Net Present Value – calculated as 
the difference between the benefits of adaptation and costs of climate change impacts (discounted for 
evaluation in dollars today at 4 percent) – is estimated at $31 million. When lost trade due to climate change 
impacts is broadly accounted for, the Net Present Value of the preferred option grows to $278 million. 

In this case, the cost of taking no adaptation action exceeds the costs associated with infrastructure 
renewal.

Lessons learned from the project relate to the challenges of integrating divergent stakeholder interests – 
however, practitioners believe the project has allowed for information-sharing around a common threat. 
Given that agricultural and transportation departments have typically worked separately, the process 
is likely to provide a more coordinated approach to the future management of the Isthmus. This study 
highlights the value of the dykes, and has challenged all stakeholders to think collaboratively and critically 
about how assets are protected in the Chignecto region.

Several gaps and barriers related to climate change adaptation in Atlantic Canada’s transportation 
sector are evident. First, there is an absence of vulnerability assessments and comprehensive data 
specific to transportation in the Atlantic region. While risk assessment protocols have been applied 
to identify climate vulnerabilities in some cases, it is not known which specific roads, rail, airports 
and ports are most and least vulnerable. In addition, for certain important weather conditions such 
as fog and wind, there is little relevant, published climate data and literature from which to draw 
conclusions. Wind and fog have major impacts on marine and air navigation in the Atlantic region, so 
further research could better inform planning and operations.  

The research conducted for this chapter also suggests that the risks to assets and operations posed 
by extreme weather events are more salient to public and private infrastructure managers than 
those related to long-term changes in climate parameters (i.e. sea-level rise, increased ambient 
temperatures). Greater attention is given by municipalities, practitioners, and infrastructure operators 
(i.e. Halifax Harbour, Port Saint John) to the increasing frequency of extreme weather events over 
other, longer-term impacts. This is not surprising, given limited public resources and the high costs 
incurred by flooding and other catastrophic events.

Likely for this same reason, practitioners and researchers conducting risk assessments and adaptation 
planning in Atlantic Canada acknowledge challenges in engaging stakeholders. The relevance of 
climate change to business owners can be difficult to explain – sea-level rise is a long-term process 
that does not fit neatly into conventional business cycles.

Despite some of these difficulties, this chapter has identified a number of tangible adaptation efforts 
in the transportation sector, just one sector among many in Atlantic Canada considering how to 
adapt to emerging climate risks (Atlantic Climate Adaptation Solutions Association, 2016). Climate 
change adaptation is a growing issue on the transportation agenda, and climate risks are spurring 
investment and planning. Practitioners are aware that the demand for transportation services will 
change in response to physical damages and service disruptions caused by changing climate 
conditions, and actions taken to enhance economic access to new or expanded markets will alter 
the supply and demand of freight in the region. Ensuring an efficient and resilient transportation 
infrastructure through collaboration and adaptation will be important to reduce impacts and 
maximize benefits from a changing climate.

Tables A1-A4: Temperature and precipitation projections by province for the Atlantic region up 
to 2100 over three time horizons (2016-2035, 2046-2065, and 2081-2100). Seasonal periods include 
winter (December-February), spring (March-May), summer (June-August), and autumn (September-
November). Data was derived from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) 
global climate model under an ensemble of RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 scenarios (Canadian 
Climate Data and Scenarios, 2015). These data reflect uncertainty associated with these projections 
by presenting a range of values from the 25th-75th percentiles of CMIP5 outputs. The median value (50th 
percentile) appears in brackets following the range.

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016KEY FINDINGS

•  Enhancing redundancy (particularly across modes) in urban transportation networks increases 
resilience to climate change. A redundant system gives travelers choices so that if one option 
performs poorly, other effective options are available. Redundancy becomes even more important 
in emergency situations (including those arising from extreme weather conditions) as it allows 
travelers to complete trips, and economies to function, even when major service disruptions occur.

•  Extreme weather events influence the perspectives and actions of urban decision-makers. Events 

with severe socioeconomic impacts demonstrate to municipal decision-makers that human activity, 
short-sighted planning decisions, or failure to act, can exacerbate weather-related damages.  
Expropriating floodplain lands and re-routing roadways away from vulnerable areas are examples of 
policy changes made in response to extreme weather events in some Canadian cities.

•  “Low-regret” or “no-regret” adaptation strategies offer municipalities opportunities to enhance the 
resilience of transportation infrastructure at key points in infrastructure lifecycles, at little additional 
cost.  One example is enhancing stormwater management capacity to reflect probable future 
precipitation conditions, when existing infrastructure reaches a renewal period. These strategies 
also build public support for adaptation efforts if benefits are tangible, communicated clearly, 
and realized quickly.

• 

• 

The cost of resilient infrastructure is considered a barrier to implementing adaptive actions. In 
terms of both capital and operational funding, innovative financing tools and intergovernmental 
partnerships could help promote adaptation when addressing Canada’s growing municipal 
infrastructure deficit.

There is a need for structured collaboration among government departments, transportation 
agencies, emergency services, municipal councils, engineers, climate change specialists, and 
civil society. Collaboration helps to ensure adaptation is a community-wide endeavour and 
highlights key interdependencies for the urban transportation sector (for example, with electricity 
and telecommunications providers).

•  Canadian cities are undertaking a number of resilience-enhancing initiatives. Examples from 

Whitehorse, Prince George, Toronto, and Moncton demonstrate the diversity of adaptive 
strategies required to deal with the range of geographic and climatic challenges across the 
country. These case studies also suggest that, increasingly, urban practitioners are moving beyond 
risk assessment and beginning to implement adaptive practices and build resilient infrastructure.

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 20161.0 INTRODUCTION

Urban transportation systems are vulnerable to both extreme weather events and the incremental 
impacts of a changing climate. Extreme weather disrupts and delays urban travel by washing out 
roadways and transit routes, and by damaging the electrical and communications systems upon 
which these modes rely. Increased temperatures cause pavement rutting, buckling of rail lines, and 
damage to infrastructure built on permafrost in Northern communities. These and other climate risks 
can affect the cost, efficiency, and safety of urban transportation in Canada.

In this chapter, urban transportation refers to all modes of transportation that carry people and 
goods within cities and, more broadly, metropolitan areas. This includes infrastructure and vehicles 
(automobiles, buses), rail transit (including metros, light rail transit [LRT], and commuter rail), and 
active modes, such as walking and cycling. Note that airports, regional and national rail systems, 
marine ports, and ferry services3 are discussed in regional chapters of this report.  

The focus of this chapter is on the vulnerability 
of urban transportation to the impacts of both 
gradual changes in climate and extreme 
weather events, taking into account the 
interactions between cities’ concentrated 
infrastructure, services, and populations. The 
chapter also explores current efforts Canadian 
municipalities are making, and those planned 
for the future, to increase transportation 
resiliency. While some of these adaptations can 
be costly, many can be classified as “no-regret” 
or “low-regret” actions – strategies which involve 
few additional costs, produce co-benefits, 
or prevent higher future costs. Integrating 
climate considerations into decision-making 
processes (i.e. mainstreaming), for example, 
in the development of Official Plans, financial 
management processes, and infrastructure 
investment decisions, makes it easier to identify 
this type of adaptation.

Statistics Canada has recently replaced the term 
“urban centre” with “population centre.”  There 
are three categories, including: 

• 

Small population centres (with populations 
between 1,000 and 29,000); 

•  Medium population centres (between 

30,000 and 99,000); and,

• 

Large population centres (populations 
exceeding 100,000) (Statistics Canada, 
2011a). 

This chapter primarily focuses on the last two 
categories, although “urban centres” and 
“population centres” are used interchangeably.

Recognizing that research examining climate impacts on urban transportation is limited in Canada, 
this chapter also draws upon relevant research from the United States, to supplement domestic 
content where appropriate.

1.1 TRENDS IN URBAN CANADA

Canada is growing increasingly urban. In the 2011 national census, 81 percent of Canadians 
indicated that they lived within medium or large population centres.  Population trends suggest that 
the nation’s largest urban areas – known as Census Metropolitan Areas (CMAs) – are growing rapidly, 
largely as a result of their ability to attract economic generators such as financial services, research 
and development agencies, and tourists, as well as newcomers to Canada (Filion and Bunting, 2010). 
Figure 1 presents the population growth in Canadian CMAs from 2006-2011.

 Ferries provide important transit services only in a few urban centres in Canada (e.g., Halifax and Vancouver).

National Census. (Source: Statistics Canada)

Both large and mid-sized cities are leading the urbanization movement in Canada. While the greater 
metropolitan areas of three cities (Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver) now account for 35 percent of 
the Canadian population (Postmedia News, 2012), many smaller cities have experienced significant 
growth as well (e.g., Saskatoon, Kelowna, and Moncton). This is a trend experts expect to continue 
well into the 21st century. Thus, adapting to climate risks in Canadian cities will occur in tandem with 
managing urban population growth.

The degree to which Canadian cities will be affected by climate change and their capacities to 
adapt varies considerably. “Adaptive capacity” is a function of many factors, including geography. 
CMAs are distributed in a number of climate regions, including two in Canada’s north (Whitehorse, 
Yukon, and Yellowknife, Northwest Territories), that face specific challenges related to rapid warming 
and thawing permafrost (see Chapter 3).

Canada’s urban development in the postwar period has been characterized by low-density, 
sprawling suburban development outward from traditional downtown cores, which encourages (and 
often requires) the daily use of automobiles (Blais, 2013).  Road congestion is taking an increasingly 
heavy toll on Canadian urban regions, accounting for $6 billion to $11 billion in lost economic 
productivity annually in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area, and $500 million to $1.2 billion 
annually in the Metro Vancouver area, depending on the specific metrics applied (Dachis, 2013; 
Dachis, 2015). However, many Canadian municipalities have begun to recognize the importance of 
compact and walkable neighbourhoods for improving the efficiency and sustainability of their urban 
environments (Ontario Ministry of Infrastructure, 2013; Metro Vancouver, 2011; Haider et al., 2013). 
As a result, there is a general movement to build “up” rather than “out,” and population density is 
increasing along with population growth: in CMAs, population density increased by an average of 6 
percent from 2006-2011 (Statistics Canada, 2011a; see Figure 2).

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Figure 2: Urban density and agglomerations in Canada. (Source: Statistics Canada)

When assessing climate impacts on cities, density (of both population and infrastructure) is a 
complicating factor. Localized impacts, such as strong winds and heavy rainfall, disrupt a higher 
volume of traffic and economic activity, and affect more individuals and infrastructure components 
in urban centres than in less densely-populated areas (Revi et al., 2014; Solecki et al., 2011). 

The deteriorating condition of municipal infrastructure further complicates the ability of Canada’s 
highgrowth and increasingly dense cities to accommodate a growing population. The 2016 
Canadian Infrastructure Report Card (CIRC), which assessed the condition of Canada’s municipally-
owned infrastructure, graded 14 percent of sidewalks, roads, and bridges, as “poor” to “very poor”, 
with a total replacement value of $50.4 billion. The CIRC provided these same grades to 17 percent 
of public transit infrastructure (vehicles, mobile technology, security systems, signalization equipment, 
and terminal facilities), with a replacement value of $9 billion (Canadian Infrastructure Report Card, 
2016).  The report indicated that under current investment/maintenance conditions, most urban 
transportation infrastructure will require significant and increasing investment as it ages – even 
infrastructure presently in “fair” to “very good” condition (Canadian Infrastructure Report Card, 2016). 
The pressure placed on this infrastructure by climate change is likely to expedite the need to replace 
or upgrade older assets.

 
CHAPTER 9: URBAN

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Transit ridership per capita in Canada is also growing annually (Canadian Urban Transit Association, 
2012), while rates of auto ownership in CMAs are decreasing (Perl and Kenworthy, 2010). Transit is 
attracting greater attention from all levels of government in Canada, with federal and provincial 
spending support for urban transit in Canada growing at a rate of 5.2 percent annually since 2008 
(Transport Canada, 2013). This is consistent with a broader international trend in urban governance to 
enhance public transportation modes as a method to reduce traffic congestion and improve public 
health (Bradford, 2008). 

Finally, it is worth considering the interactions of multiple infrastructure systems in cities. Vehicles 
and at-grade rail systems rely heavily on drainage infrastructure to manage storm runoff. Rail transit 
networks in cities such as Calgary, Edmonton, Toronto, and Montreal depend on reliable electricity to 
power vehicles and communications networks. Vehicles and bus transit systems also rely on municipal 
electricity and emergency response resources for traffic signals and safety. This provides important 
context for this chapter, as both the public and private sectors in Canada are challenged to maintain 
or improve this array of interrelated urban infrastructure while simultaneously enhancing the resilience 
of transportation networks to changing climate conditions. 

1.2 ADAPTATION TO A CHANGING CLIMATE

A number of strategies can be used to reduce the impacts of observed and anticipated changes in 
climate and extreme weather on urban transportation systems. The strategies discussed in this chapter 
fall into the following general categories:

• 

• 

Investing in more resilient materials, infrastructure, and operational practices for transportation 
infrastructure; 

Improving redundancy within transportation networks – this refers to the availability of multiple 
paths or modes for urban travel with similar user costs; 

•  Updating the climate design criteria used in engineering standards to better reflect future 

conditions; 

• 

Improving land use policies and controls (e.g., zoning amendments or construction requirements in 
vulnerable areas); and 

•  Enhancing the resilience of communities to extreme weather and climate effects through social 

adaptations.

2.0 CLIMATE AND URBAN TRANSPORTATION 

Understanding the historical interactions of climate, weather, and geography are important to 
determine how climate change will affect urban transportation in Canadian cities in the 21st century. 
Location is an important factor in urban vulnerability to climate change, as many cities in Canada are 
located in low-lying areas next to significant bodies of water (Filion and Bunting, 2010). Floodplains, 
coastal regions, and other vulnerable areas could experience significant flooding, erosion, and 
infrastructure damage as a result of a changing climate and more frequent extreme weather events 
(Revi et al., 2014). While today’s planning provisions often restrict development in vulnerable areas, 
this legacy of urban vulnerability persists, and is heightened by increasing population densities. 
Understanding how cities have dealt with climate impacts in the past helps vulnerable cities make 
informed decisions and investments, in order to adapt to emerging climate conditions. 

This section provides an overview of climate and weather-related impacts on urban transportation 
in Canada, and projected climate conditions for the 21st century. Regionally-specific discussions of 
climate can be found in other chapters of this report.

Much has been learned about how to adapt to severe weather across all modes of urban 
transportation in Canada. Some examples are explored in this section.  

REGINA CYCLONE, JUNE 1912

The Regina Cyclone, which occurred on June 12th, 1912, remains the most destructive tornado in 
Canadian history. It killed 30 residents, left 2500 homeless, and resulted in $1.2 million (approximately 
$25 million in 2015 dollars4) in property and infrastructure damage (Environment Canada, 2013a; 
Saskatchewan Archives Board, 2011). The damage was so significant that it took the municipality 
40 years to pay back the debts it incurred (Saskatchewan Archives Board, 2011). The loss of the 
Canadian Pacific Railroad freight depot was particularly detrimental. The cyclone flipped railcars and 
destroyed grain warehouses, flattening a keystone of Western Canada’s grain transportation network 
and affecting cities across the country that relied on western grain (Martin, 2012;). 

In the century since this event, emergency management and communication protocols have 
changed significantly (including the use of electronic and social media to warn operators and 
travelers of impending threats), and urban building codes and materials are much more resilient to 
wind and rain (Martin, 2012). While the damage and disruption associated with a similar event would 
likely be severe, the transportation and other infrastructure impacts of a tornado would not be as 
devastating today thanks to more stringent building codes and improved materials (Martin, 2012).

FRASER RIVER VALLEY FLOOD, SPRING 1948

An unusually rapid warming of a heavy mountain snowpack caused the Fraser River, in British 
Columbia, to flood in May and June 1948. Floodwaters engulfed 2,300 homes, leaving 16,000 
homeless and 10 dead (Robinson and Cruikshank, 2006). The estimated damage was $20 million 
(approximately $220 million in 2015 dollars) (Environment Canada, 2010). 

The network of dykes set up to protect the urban areas of Chilliwack, Mission, and New Westminster 
were considered adequate for minor flood protection, but were unable to withstand the flood’s 
high-water levels. On June 10, the river reached a peak height of 7.6 m in Mission, flooding streets 
and nearby highways, impeding vehicles, pedestrians, and two rail lines running through the town 
(McLean et al., 2007; Environment Canada, 2010). While only 0.5 percent of the 1,375-km floodplain 
is at risk of flooding today, this high-risk area includes a number of urban centres, and is home to two 
airports and key segments of highway and railway (Environment Canada, 2010).

Governments and decision-makers learned several lessons in the aftermath of the Fraser River floods. 
Better regional coordination, emergency planning, and awareness have catalyzed municipal, 
provincial, and federal governments to invest $300 million since 1948 to improve dykes and other 
flood-prevention measures in the region (to withstand a 200-year flood event); as a result, the 
adaptive capacity and resilience of these communities has been increased (McLean et al., 2007). 

While significant improvements in flood control have been made, the Fraser Valley’s urban regions 
face heightened risks to similar or more significant events in coming decades as a result of a changing 
climate.

Hurricane Hazel, which hit the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) in October of 1954, may be Canada’s 
best-known weather-related urban disaster, and remains one of the most costly storms in the region’s 
history. A wet autumn season left Ontario’s soils supersaturated (Environment Canada, 2013a), 
which worsened the impact of 210 mm of rain that fell in a 36-hour period.  Severe flash floods 
killed 81 people (Toronto and Region Conservation Authority, 2016). Damages totaled $100 million 
(approximately $900 million in 2015 dollars), half of which was spent replacing damaged or destroyed 
transportation infrastructure (Robinson and Cruikshank, 2006). 

Disruptions to transportation systems were significant:

•  Many train routes were delayed or otherwise affected, and a CNR railcar was overturned 

(Environment Canada, 2013a). 

•  CNR reported a dramatic increase in train travel during the storm due to widespread road 

flooding. 14,000 people traveled by train during Hurricane Hazel, compared to the daily 
average of 1,000 (Environment Canada, 2013a), demonstrating the importance of redundant 
transportation options in maintaining mobility during extreme events. 

•  Major flooding and washouts occurred on Highways 400, 11, and 12, stranding motorists.  Sections 

of these highways, in the storm’s peak, were under approximately 1m of water. 

•  A total of 40 bridges were damaged and 10 were de-commissioned. Many bridges serving key 

arterials, including connections over the Don River, York Mills, and Bayview Avenue, were severed, 
causing considerable social disruption (Environment Canada, 2013a).

The GTA took adaptive action after Hazel to address the hurricane’s immediate effects and reduce 
vulnerability to similar future events. The city placed specific focus on emergency management 
policy and infrastructure decision-making. For example, the proposed location of Toronto’s Gardiner 
Expressway route was amended, elevating the roadway and setting it back further from the shore 
of Lake Ontario. This busy highway running through downtown Toronto, yet to be built in 1954, would

(Environment Canada, 2015). In Hazel’s wake, the City also placed greater emphasis on restoring 
transit services in a timely manner to alleviate road congestion during and after emergencies 
(Environment Canada, 2015).

Hurricane Hazel also shifted decision-makers’ perspectives in Ontario. They no longer framed natural 
disasters as “acts of god” – rather, an important and transformative link was made between weather-
related damage and planning decisions (Henstra, 2011). Hazel prompted the Toronto and Region 
Conservation Authority to make many policy changes that resulted in greater resilience to extreme 
weather and flood events. Specifically, the Authority:

•  Expropriated floodplain lands near 

watercourses and prevented development in 
these areas; 

• 

• 

Increased the amount of water-absorbing 
green space in the city; and,

Improved watercourse management 
infrastructure and techniques (Robinson and 
Cruikshank, 2006). 

Prior to Hurricane Hazel, volunteer groups 
typically led storm clean-up efforts in Ontario. 
Hazel gave municipalities the impetus to 
leverage provincial and federal governments for 
resources to adequately prepare for and recover 
from extreme weather events (Robinson and 
Cruikshank, 2006). 

EASTERN CANADA ICE STORM, JANUARY 1998

From January 4th to 10th, 1998, significant amounts 
of freezing rain accumulated from eastern 
Ontario to Nova Scotia. Greater than 100 mm 
of ice fell in more than 80 hours of precipitation, 
leaving over 4 million people without electricity, 
and resulting in significant transportation 
disruptions. Electrical wires, utility poles and tree 
branches blocked roadways, and power outages 
disrupted traffic signals. Roads were closed 
and public transit services were delayed and 
cancelled, while icy conditions caused accidents 
and made travel dangerous (Bertin, 1998). More 
than 16,000 Canadian Forces personnel were 
deployed to manage the aftermath; Environment 
Canada estimated the initial insurance claims to 
be more than $1.5B, with a total exceeding $3 
billion (Environment Canada, 2013b).

Following the ice storm, several measures were implemented based on the lessons learned. For example, 
the province of Quebec adopted legislation requiring all municipalities to prepare emergency plans 
and created better communication between the provincial and municipal governments (Institute for 
Catastrophic Loss Reduction, 2016). Hydro-Quebec also took measures to prevent power outages such 
as reinforcing transmission towers, adding additional hydro lines and burying power lines (The Canadian 
Press, 2008). While these measures were largely focused on public health and safety, better emergency 
planning, communications and electricity systems also support the resiliency of transportation systems.

Cities in Atlantic Canada have also experienced severe impacts from extreme weather events, 
and climate models suggest the frequency of these events will increase in this region in the 21st 
century (AMEC Inc., 2011). Hurricane Juan, that struck Halifax on September 29th, 2003, was the 
most destructive storm in the city’s history, due to effects of storm surge (temporary sea-level rise), 
intense flooding, and strong winds (Environment Canada, 2013a). Sustained wind speeds reached 
a maximum of 160 km/h. Halifax Harbour experienced wind gusts up to 230km/h and storm surges 
of 1.5-2m, leading to severe shoreline erosion and the loss of railway tracks (Bowyer, 2003a). 
Containers were blown off ships in the port, and several rail cars were washed into the Atlantic 
at the Dartmouth rail yard (Bowyer, 2003c). The storm’s volatility and disruption to transportation 
services contributed to the closure of businesses and schools for five days (Bowyer, 2003b). 
The estimated cost of damages related to Hurricane Juan totaled $200 million (Environment 
Canada, 2013a). The event prompted decision-makers in Atlantic Canada to improve planning 
and preparation processes for extreme weather events: clearer channels were created for 
communication and coordination among provincial and local emergency response departments, 
and hurricane-specific training for emergency personnel was mandated in the immediate 
aftermath (Government of Nova Scotia, 2003).

Several extreme summer storm events have caused substantial disruption and damage to the Greater 
Toronto Area (GTA). In August 2005, intense rainfall and flooding cost the City of Toronto $47 million 
(insurance covered the additional $500 million in damages) (McLeod, 2011). One major culvert on 
Finch Avenue sustained $4 million in damages due to wash-out (City of Toronto, 2014; McLeod, 2011; 
see Figure 7).  

Figure 7: A section of Finch Avenue washed out during the heavy rainstorm of August 19, 2005. 
(Source: City of Toronto)

Similarly, during a severe storm in July 2013, 126mm of rain fell on the GTA within two hours, resulting in 
$850 million in insurance claims (Environment Canada, 2014). While the hourly rate of rainfall (intensity) 
was higher during this event than during Hurricane Hazel, damage was significantly less severe due in 
part to improvements in Ontario’s emergency planning policy framework after Hazel (Henstra, 2011; 
Aulakh, 2013). Transportation disruption was significant nonetheless. Subways were closed due to 
flooding, GO trains were evacuated by police boats, and drivers faced washed-out roads. However, 
transportation networks in the city were almost completely restored by the following day (CBC News, 
2013). A number of adaptive actions were identified in the aftermath of this crisis, including the 
development of more robust flood management and prevention plans for the Don Valley, and the 
installation of emergency back-up power at key bus and locomotive maintenance facilities.  

CALGARY FLOOD, JUNE 2013

An important final example relates to the flooding of the Bow River in Calgary, Alberta in June 2013. At 
the storm’s peak, 200mm of rain fell within approximately 16 hours on supersaturated soil and, in some 
places, still-frozen ground (Davison and Powers, 2013). As Canada’s costliest climate-related disaster 
to date, damages in Calgary are estimated to surpass $6 billion. Damage included bridges, culverts, 
roads (over 1,000 km) and public transit infrastructure (Environment Canada, 2014). In addition, scour 
(the removal of supporting earth by fast-moving water) caused the Bonnybrook Bridge to partially 
collapse, leaving six Canadian Pacific Railway freight cars hanging over the Bow River; shortly 
thereafter, the bridge was de-commissioned (Canadian Press, 2014). The Transportation Safety Board

more frequent bridge inspections, reduced train speeds in scour-prone areas, and investment and 
research into early-detection technologies for structures vulnerable to scour and erosion.

2.2 CLIMATE TRENDS AND FUTURE PROJECTIONS

This section provides a summary of projected climate conditions for 21st-century Canada, with a focus 
on climate elements of particular relevance to urban transportation. These include:

•  Greater variation and extremes in seasonal and annual air temperature; 

•  Changing precipitation patterns; 

• 

Increasing intensity and duration of wind speed, particularly during storm events;

•  Changing patterns of sea and lake ice; 

• 

Increasing permafrost degradation; 

•  Changing water levels, along both coastal and inland waterways; and,

•  Combinations of these changing climate elements. 

 
CHAPTER 9: URBAN 

276
276

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016AIR TEMPERATURE

Average air temperature in Canada increased by 1.5˚C from 1950-2010, and is projected to increase 
by about 1.5-2.5˚C by mid-century (in a low-emissions scenario), with increasing frequency of 
extreme heat and decreasing frequency of extreme cold (Bush et al., 2014). In cities, these trends are 
exacerbated by the urban heat-island effect, referring to the difference between surface and air 
temperatures (typically 10-15˚C for surfaces and 1-3˚C for air) in urban centres and surrounding rural 
areas. The heat island effect occurs due to a combination of factors (Figure 9), including: 

• 

• 

• 

The lack of vegetation in cities (which regulates temperature);

The low solar-reflective capacity of urban infrastructure;

The high heat-absorbance of urban materials (e.g., black asphalt) – highly-developed areas have 
less surface moisture available for evapotranspiration (which cools surrounding air) than natural 
ground cover, due to impervious surfaces like pavement and concrete (75-100 percent cover in 
most cities);

•  Anthropogenic (human-caused) heat production (e.g., air conditioning, vehicles, industrial 

activities); and, 

•  Urban topography (e.g., narrow streets limit the capacity of buildings to radiate heat at night and 

limit the passage of cooling winds) (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2008). 

Urban heat islands have implications for the integrity of transportation infrastructure, particularly 
pavement. Figure 10 provides an example of an urban heat island map for Montreal, Quebec. 

Figure 9: An illustration of an urban heat island profile. The impacts of heat waves tend to be greater 
in urban, rather than suburban or rural areas, likely owing to the ‘heat island’ effect. (Source: Natural 
Resources Canada)

PRECIPITATION

Projected changes in precipitation in Canada, include an increase in British Columbia and Atlantic 
Canada, as well as changes to the seasonal distribution of precipitation across the country (Bush 
et al., 2014). Precipitation is expected to increase in all seasons across most of Canada, with the 
exception of a summer decline in the southwest (Bush et al., 2014). Figure 11 shows changes in 
precipitation patterns in Canada over the last 59 years.

Change Canada)

 
CHAPTER 9: URBAN

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016WIND

Changes in patterns of wind relate to temperature and precipitation trends and extremes. One study 
suggests that the intensity of average daily wind speed will increase by 10-30 percent across Canada 
by the late 21st century, compared to baseline conditions in the period from 1955-2009 (Cheng et al., 
2014). However, the extent of these changes remains uncertain. 

LAKE, RIVER, AND SEA ICE

Changing patterns of lake, river, and sea ice pose risks to urban regions next to watercourses 
and oceans. The extent and seasonal duration of inland ice is likely to decrease as winters warm; 
however, shifting patterns of spring break-up pose risks in terms of ice-jam flooding and infrastructure 
management on rivers and lakes (Bush et al., 2014). For example, in spring 2015, this phenomenon 
prompted the emergency evacuation of Perth-Andover, New Brunswick (see Chapter 8) (Canadian 
Press, 2015a).

Figure 12: Ice jam prompts evacuation order in Perth-Andover in spring 2015. (Source: Perth-Andover 
Fire Department)

WATER LEVELS

Both inland and ocean water levels are projected to change significantly in Canada, although 
the direction of change will vary geographically. While most of the Atlantic and Pacific coasts will 
experience sea level rise, much of the northern coast will experience relative sea-level decline due 
to a phenomenon known as “glacial isostatic rebound,” in which land formerly covered by glaciers 
slowly decompresses and rises (Atkinson et al., 2016). While water levels on some inland waterways 
are expected to decline (such as the Great Lakes) as a result of greater evaporation, others will rise, 
at least temporarily (Bush et al., 2014).

 
CHAPTER 9: URBAN

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016PERMAFROST

Thawing permafrost is a significant issue in Canada’s north, where infrastructure is built on soils 
underlain by permafrost (Prowse et al., 2009; Transportation Association of Canada, 2010) (see 
Chapter 3).

Temperature variations may also change the nature of transportation hazards in winter. For example, 
areas traditionally challenged by snowfall may face increased freezing rain and black ice.

2.3 CLIMATE RISKS TO URBAN TRANSPORTATION

Roadways, rail transit systems, and active transportation networks are vulnerable to climate risks 
and extreme weather in two key ways. First, operations can be disrupted by extreme weather 
events and obstructed rights-of-way, as described in Section 2.1. Second, infrastructure is structurally 
and physically vulnerable to the increasing range of some climate variables (i.e. temperature 
and precipitation) expected under future conditions. Infrastructure may be exposed to weather 
extremes unaccounted for in original engineering designs, which assumed that past climate extremes 
accurately represent future conditions (see Box). Severe weather and shifting “average” conditions 
can therefore shorten infrastructure life spans, reduce performance, and increase maintenance and 
operating costs (McLeod and Stevanovic-Briatico, 2014). The following sections provide an overview 
of climate impacts to urban transportation systems summarized in Table 1.

REGULATORY VULNERABILITIES:  CODES, STANDARDS, AND RELATED INSTRUMENTS (CSRI)

The failure to sufficiently consider changing climate conditions in the development and application 
of engineering and land-use standards might be termed “regulatory vulnerability.” A survey of case 
studies which used the Public Infrastructure Engineering Vulnerability Committee (PIEVC) Engineering 
Protocol5 considered the role codes, standards and related instruments (CSRI) play with respect to 
resilient infrastructure (Engineers Canada, 2012). The survey found that some jurisdictions apply national 
codes directly; some modify national codes; and others develop location-specific codes to reflect local 
geography and risk-tolerance preferences. The report concluded that adopting a “climate adjustment 
factor” into CSRI at the national level may not revolutionize local practices, but the authors suggest 
that frequent updates based on climate model projections would assist practitioners in adapting their 
CSRI. Other inputs to CSRI, including professional judgment and management direction based on local 
conditions; accepted practices of the era; maintenance, operability, and procurement considerations; 
and other social, environmental, and economic factors, were considered robust in Canada (Engineers 
Canada, 2012).

  The PIEVC Engineering Protocol, led by Engineers Canada, was developed as a 5-step process to analyze the 
engineering vulnerability of individual infrastructure systems based on current climate and future climate projections.

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016 3.0 URBAN ROAD INFRASTRUCTURE

Urban road infrastructure includes roads for vehicles, (i.e. trucks and buses, whether electrified trolleys 
or diesel); electricity for traffic signals, signage, and lighting; bridges; and stormwater management 
infrastructure (culverts, ditches, etc.). While per capita vehicle-km travelled (VKT) in Canadian cities 
is modestly declining (Perl and Kenworthy, 2010), roadways remain critically important to urban 
economies for the movement of both freight and passengers. This is particularly the case in cities 
without strong transit links between urban centres and outlying suburban communities. 

PRECIPITATION 

Precipitation affects urban roads and bridges in a variety of ways. Washouts (due to soil/slope 
instability when water infiltrates a roadway’s substructure) and flooding often result in delays, 
detours, and closures that reduce mobility and increase travel times for both automobiles and bus 
transit (United States Federal Highway Administration, 2015; Andrey and Mills, 2003). High-intensity 
precipitation events disrupt power to traffic signals and other supporting infrastructure, cause 
roadway disruptions when runoff volumes exceed the capacity of culverts and runoff ponds, and 
overwhelm the permeability of construction materials, reducing road safety (increasing the risk of 
accidents), and increasing the risk of bridge scour (Andrey and Mills, 2003; Transportation Research 
Board, 2008; Revi et al., 2014). For example, on May 29, 2012 in Montreal, 45 mm of rain fell in under an 
hour, resulting in flash flooding and closing streets. 

While the proportion of snow as winter precipitation is likely to decline throughout Canada over the 21st 
century (Bruce, 2011), extreme winter storms producing heavy snowfall will continue to disrupt roadways 
and transit operations. This can result in significant service delays, as was the case in Ottawa, in 2013 
when heavy snowfall caused buses to lose traction and become stuck (CTV News, 2013). 

Freezing rain is likely to become more frequent in many parts of Canada (Cheng et al., 2011), causing 
ice build-up, road blockages, and power outages due to fallen tree branches and utility lines, and 
posing risks to road safety in urban areas (Andrey, 2010; Andrey et al., 2013). Increased salt usage to 
combat icy road conditions corrodes concrete infrastructure, and carries negative implications for the 
well-being of roadside ecosystems and urban water supplies (McLeod and Stevanovic-Briatico, 2014).

TEMPERATURE 

Climate-induced stress to pavement mixtures is a growing issue for road operators. While most asphalt 
and concrete used in Canada is designed to withstand temperatures between -20˚C and 30˚C, 
projected temperatures for many Canadian cities in the 21st century exceed this range. In extreme 
heat during summer months, softening, rutting, flushing, and bleeding of asphalt are expected to 
increase in frequency and severity (Mills and Andrey, 2002). Softening and rutting occur when vehicles 
depress hot pavement (Mills et al., 2009). Bleeding refers to asphalt moving above a pavement’s 
surface treatment (the waterproof layer upon which vehicles drive); flushing refers to the upward 
movement of asphalt to the fringe of the surface treatment, though not beyond the aggregate 
seal. While bleeding leads to more serious roadway damage, both phenomena reduce pavement 
integrity (Texas Department of Transportation, 2006). Softened pavement also leads to reduced 
maximum loads on municipal roadways, reduced ride quality and vehicle performance, increased 
maintenance costs, and reduced lifespan of roads, bridges, and culverts (McLeod and Stevanovic-
Briatico, 2014). In extreme heat, trucks and buses wear more heavily on roads than automobiles due 
to their more substantial chassis and passenger loads, exacerbating pavement rutting and shearing 
issues (Savonis et al., 2008). 

Extreme heat also produces heat stress for construction workers (Transportation Research Board, 
2008); on especially hot summer days, it may not be safe or possible to carry out construction work 
during peak daytime hours (United States Federal Highway Administration, 2015).

 
CHAPTER 9: URBAN 

281
281

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Bridge infrastructure is also vulnerable to extreme heat. Bridges are designed to withstand some 
expansion and contraction through the use of flexible materials embedded between fixed points.  
However, as temperatures increase, the limits of these expansion joints can be exceeded, displacing 
material or cracking deck materials, especially at the interface with fixed points. This cracking can 
lead to substantial bridge deterioration, resulting in closures and lengthy detours (Cohen et al., 2005). 
In addition, both extreme heat and cold may result in malfunctioning traffic control signals (McLeod 
and Stevanovic-Briatico, 2014). 

As seasonal temperature patterns shift, the frequency of freeze-thaw cycling is likely to increase 
throughout Canada, and the timing and onset of freeze-thaw events are likely to change, with 
implications for road infrastructure (Transportation Research Board, 2008). During periods of thaw, 
moisture seeps into small cracks, freezes and expands when cold returns, and melts (causing 
pavement weakness) during the next thaw (United States Federal Highway Administration, 2015). As 
a result, pavement is more likely to experience shearing (cracking) and rutting, reducing the strength 
and stability of roadways (Transportation Research Board, 2008; United States Federal Highway 
Administration, 2015). In northern climates, freeze-thaw cycling and temperature increases also 
contribute to further permafrost degradation, which poses risks to the stability of urban roads and their 
embankments (Woudsma et al., 2007; Transportation Association of Canada, 2010).

CHANGING WATER LEVELS

Bridge scour, which refers to the removal of supportive sand and rock sediment around bridges 
constructed over waterways (Transportation Research Board, 2008), has affected many Canadian 
jurisdictions during high-water events (Environment Canada, 2014). Similarly, flooding and storm surges 
pose erosion risks to coastal highways – this is particularly problematic in Atlantic Canada and British 
Columbia (AMEC Inc., 2011). Vancouver was recently named the 15th most-vulnerable city in the world 
to sea level rise, with likely impacts to road infrastructure by 2100 (at which point 1.1m of sea level rise 
is anticipated).  These impacts include inundation, erosion, and washing-out of low-lying downtown 
streets (Mills, 2016).

WIND

Data suggest the intensity of wind gusts (on average and during extreme events) is likely to increase 
over the 21st century in Canada (Cheng et al., 2008), although with considerable regional variability 
(Cheng et al., 2014). Fallen debris (i.e. power lines, trees, and branches) from high winds can obstruct 
roadways, sidewalks, and cycling pathways (City of Montreal, 2015), while blowing snow disrupts 
visibility in winter months (Andrey et al., 2013). Strong winds may also temporarily close bridges – for 
instance, the Burlington Skyway near Hamilton, Ontario is closed when winds reach or exceed 85km/h 
(Craggs, 2014). 

WILDFIRE

Changing patterns of temperature and precipitation affect the frequency and severity of wildfires, 
particularly in Canada’s drier, western regions (i.e., the Prairies and British Columbia). Recent research 
suggests that the frequency of wildfires will rise over the 21st century, and that fire management 
agencies in both coastal and temperate areas may need to adapt their planning and response 
capacities to deal with potential changes in fire regimes (Wang et al., 2015). This has implications for 
transportation, particularly for emergency response planning. For example, during the catastrophic 
2011 wildfires in Slave Lake, Alberta, emergency personnel successfully coordinated the evacuation 
of residents by road, despite the availability of only a handful of exit routes out of the town (which 
quickly became congested) and thick smoke. This success was attributed to planning and coordination 
amongst municipal departments and emergency personnel prior to the crisis (KPMG, 2012).

 
CHAPTER 9: URBAN 

282

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016OPPORTUNITIES

There are also opportunities for road transport associated with climate change. In southern cities, for 
instance, construction seasons are likely to be longer, and winter road-maintenance costs are likely to 
be lower in warmer winters, despite an increasing proportion of freezing rain (Andrey and Mills, 2003; 
Fu et al., 2009). It remains to be seen, however, what impact increased freeze-thaw cycling might 
have on these cost savings.

4.0 URBAN RAIL TRANSPORTATION 

Urban rail systems include subways, LRT, and streetcars. They also include urban freight systems, 
although information on the regional and national rail system can be found in the regional chapters 
of this report.

Ongoing and planned rail-transit projects, including those identified below, complement existing and 
well-used LRT and subway systems in Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Montreal, and Toronto. Other 
jurisdictions with smaller populations are also beginning to recognize the benefits of investment in 
rapid transit. For example, the City of London is in the public consultation and mode-selection phase 
for rapid transit, and Victoria is in the planning stages of bringing LRT to its metropolitan area. These 
projects demonstrate renewed public interest in, and support for, rapid transit in general and rail-
based modes in particular.

• 

Toronto: Eglinton Crosstown LRT and Scarborough subway extension (construction phase);

•  Kitchener-Cambridge-Waterloo: ION LRT (construction phase);

• 

The Greater Toronto and Hamilton area:  Electrification of the GO Transit network (planning phase); 
and,

•  Ottawa: Confederation Line LRT (construction phase).

PRECIPITATION 

Many urban rail systems rely on municipal electricity grids; therefore, locomotives and signals are 
vulnerable to power outages in extreme weather conditions (i.e. rainfall and snow). Track beds are 
also subject to a number of the same climate impacts as urban roadways, including reduced stability 
during flooding and erosion during extreme precipitation events (Mills and Andrey, 2002).  

As with roads, precipitation can overload the stormwater management infrastructure that protects 
underground, surface, and elevated rail transit. Extreme weather events can result in flooding and 
inundation of rail systems, as was the case in Toronto in the summer of 2013 (Wooler, 2004). Extreme 
precipitation in Montreal during May 2012 (discussed in Section 3) also resulted in tunnel closures and 
the evacuation of several metro stations (City of Montreal, 2015).

TEMPERATURE 

Rail infrastructure is prone to buckling in extreme heat, increasing the potential for sensor 
malfunctions, scheduling delays, speed restrictions, and – in extreme cases – derailment (Savonis et 
al., 2008). Tunnels used in underground rail transit systems can also experience operational challenges 
during extreme heat, including mechanical issues with ventilation. As a result, operators need to 
sufficiently consider passenger comfort, health, and safety (Office of the Federal Coordinator for 
Meteorological Services and Supporting Research (OFCM), 2002). 

 
CHAPTER 9: URBAN 

283
283

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Extreme cold also affects urban rail. For instance, the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) subway system 
faced several extreme-cold power outages in the winter of 2015, due primarily to broken water 
mains flooding tunnels (McLeod and Stevanovic-Briatico, 2014). Cold temperatures can also cause 
frozen track signal switches, delaying trains (Canadian Press, 2015b). However, this may become less 
problematic in southern cities if the frequency of cold days and nights decreases as projected (Bush 
et al., 2014).

CHANGING WATER LEVELS AND STORM SURGE

During periods of seasonal ice-jam flooding, railways adjacent to water and their embankments 
may be inundated, washed-out, or eroded. Bridge scour is also a risk for rail bridges, as suggested by 
Calgary’s experience in the summer of 2013 (see Section 2.1).

WIND 

High-intensity wind events also pose risks to rail infrastructure and operations, such as damage to 
overhead cables and tall signalization equipment, and rail-car blow-over (OFCM, 2002). Similar to 
roads, rail lines may also be obstructed by fallen debris causing service delays. 

OPPORTUNITIES

Investment in rail transit can enhance the redundancy of urban transportation networks, providing mass 
transit options when roads are closed, unsafe, or congested (Box 1).  Rail transit projects could also 
benefit from longer construction seasons, as winters shorten (Transportation Research Board, 2008).  

BOX 1: REDUNDANCY IN URBAN TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS

Redundancy is one method to enhance the resiliency of transportation networks to extreme weather and a 
changing climate. A redundant system allows travelers choices so that even when major service disruptions 
occur (e.g., extreme congestion or wash-out), other options are available, and travelers can complete 
their trips and economies can continue to function. For example, in major cities like Montreal and Toronto, 
if localized flooding causes the subway system to stop running,  users can still travel by foot, bicycle, and 
on public buses. An opposite example is the nearly singular reliance of travelers in the Greater Toronto and 
Hamilton Area on Highway 401 for travel between Toronto and points east and west. If Highway 401 were 
closed, the alternative roadway and transit networks would be insufficient to maintain reasonable travel 
times and reliability. 

Improving redundancy does not mean building additional roads, particularly above the level of current 
demand in corridors. In North American history, the construction of extra roads has often stimulated latent 
(hidden) demand for road capacity, and done little to reduce congestion, improve network efficiency, or 
address issues associated with urban sprawl (Duranton and Turner, 2011).

Walking and cycling networks are critical to the movement of people within Canadian cities. Public 
transit users, cyclists, and auto travelers are all pedestrians at some stage in their journeys, and 
pedestrian and cycling facilities provide the most reliable forms of connectivity within cities. Active 
modes have increasingly been a focus of investment at the municipal level in Canada, addressing 
climate change concerns from both mitigation and adaptation perspectives (Younger et al., 2008; 
Ayres, 2014). While the social and environmental benefits of active transportation are well-publicized 
in municipal planning documents, these modes are also becoming more attractive for short trips as a 
way to save time as Canadian cities become increasingly dense and traffic-congested. 

Active transportation modes also offer an important form of redundancy to urban transportation 
networks (Box 1). Walking and cycling offer a “safety net,” permitting travel when mechanized 
transport is temporarily unavailable. Given the benefits of active transportation in terms of public 
health, relative insensitivity to climate change impacts, and low capital costs and environmental 
impacts, many cities in Canada (and globally) are increasingly investing in these modes.

PRECIPITATION 

Active transportation systems face many of the same vulnerabilities as roadways in terms of 
pavement degradation, storm-water management issues related to runoff and permeability, and 
associated operational disruptions (e.g., flooding and washout). This is especially true for sidewalks 
and bicycle lanes next to urban roadways, which make up the majority of active transportation 
infrastructure in Canada (Transport Canada, 2011). 

There tends to be a modal shift away from walking and cycling during precipitation events – all forms 
of precipitation reduce the proportion of trips taken by active modes (Koatse and Rietveld, 2009). 
Similarly, pedestrian safety decreases in bad weather, with the number of outdoor injuries increasing 
dramatically in response to winter precipitation (including snow, rain, and freezing rain) (Morency et 
al., 2012). However, active transportation remains an important form of redundancy. Travelers are 
likely to walk in poor weather conditions if roads or transit lines are incapacitated, which means the 
volume of commuter (i.e. essential) trips is not significantly affected by severe weather (Koatse and 
Rietveld, 2009; Sabir et al., 2010).   

TEMPERATURE 

Extreme temperatures also affect the use of active modes. Walking and cycling on hot days requires 
more exertion and may pose health risks, particularly to vulnerable populations (such as the elderly) 
(Younger et al., 2008), a phenomenon worsened by the urban heat island effect (see Section 2.2).  
Some research (i.e. Sabir et al., 2010) suggests that during extreme cold, cyclists shift to public transit 
and walking, while the opposite is true during periods of extreme warm weather. However, other 
research (i.e. Koatse and Rietveld, 2009) has found that both extremely high and low temperatures 
are likely to reduce cycling activity.

CHANGING WATER LEVELS AND STORM SURGE

As with roadways, walking and bicycle paths (especially along coastal roads, or in ocean-side parks) 
are at risk of inundation and wash-out due to sea-level rise and storm surge (Mills, 2016).

Active transportation infrastructure tends to be less vulnerable to structural impacts than road 
and transit systems, due to the absence of heavy, motorized traffic. However, elevated portions of 
walkways and bikeways, as well as signage, can be damaged by high winds during extreme weather 
events (OFCM, 2002). Strong winds are also associated with lower levels of cycling (Koatse and 
Rietveld, 2009). High winds will also pose a safety hazard to cyclist and pedestrians, due to flying and 
falling debris.

OPPORTUNITIES

Warmer winters with less snow in many Canadian cities will provide longer seasonal access to walking 
and cycling infrastructure. Some Northern cities view climate risks to roadway infrastructure as an 
opportunity to enhance active modes. Whitehorse, for instance, has placed significant emphasis on 
active transportation in recent years and invested in high-profile cycling facilities. This is, in part, due to 
a projected increase in the length of the season in which cycling and walking is possible for most trips 
(Transport Canada, 2011).

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 20166.0 CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION PRACTICES FOR URBAN TRANSPORTATION

Reducing the vulnerability of Canadian urban areas to a changing climate and extreme weather 
requires effective governance and collaboration within and between governments, transportation 
agencies, and other municipal sectors. In Canada, federal, provincial and territorial policy 
frameworks and funding programs can support municipal adaptation efforts, while both public and 
private transportation agencies are responsible for providing safe and efficient services in the face of 
more variable weather and climate conditions.

Sharing knowledge about resilient infrastructure and operational practices is also critical. At the 
municipal level, there are a number of networks for climate adaptation knowledge-sharing, including 
ICLEI Canada (Local Governments for Sustainability). ICLEI Canada’s Building Adaptive and Resilient 
Communities (BARC) initiative (Box 2) is an interactive web-based tool designed to help local 
governments identify and adopt climate adaptation strategies. Member municipalities receive one-
on-one staff support for using the tool (ICLEI, 2010), and transportation is a key aspect of this program.

BUILDING ADAPTIVE AND RESILIENT COMMUNITIES (BARC) INITIATIVE 

BARC operates through a five-step “milestone” process: 

• 

Initiate, in which stakeholders are identified and council resolutions made to address adaptation; 

•  Research, which involves determination of likely climate changes and risk assessment; 

•  Plan, in which adaptation objectives, actions, and budgeting are undertaken; 

• 

Implementation, in which actions are put into motion and political support is solidified; and

•  Monitor/Review, in which the effectiveness of action is determined, successes are communicated, and 

revisions are made (ICLEI, 2010). 

Adaptation strategies can be placed into the following five categories according to their style of 
intervention, as per the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (2014).

DISASTER RISK-MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES

These strategies are familiar to municipalities, and have helped many cities successfully reduce 
the impacts of severe weather events in the past (e.g., Halifax and Hurricane Juan, Slave Lake and 
wildfire). Examples include changing emergency-management procedures in light of experienced 
or expected climate-related impacts, and assessing organizational risk through programming and 
software applications; and others. Calgary and Toronto have recent experience with climate-related 
disaster response, as both cities experienced severe weather events in the summer of 2013 (Davison 
and Powers, 2013). Examples include updating flood-, fire-, tsunami-, and hurricane-preparedness 
plans, and updating floodplain maps.

SPATIAL AND LAND-USE ADAPTATION 

This category of strategies includes changing procedures for land-use control and infrastructure 
design in certain areas to take into consideration past or expected climate impacts. Low-impact 
roadway designs include standards that aim to reduce total runoff and runoff rates, and natural 

 
CHAPTER 9: URBAN 

289
289

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016methods to mitigate runoff (National Cooperative Highway Research Program, 2006), such as 
mandating the use of permeable materials (Credit Valley Conservation Authority, 2014). These are 
also relevant for active transportation – for instance, the North American City Transportation Officials 
(NACTO) guidelines for sidewalk and bikeway design recognize the importance of low-impact 
considerations for stormwater management. This includes increasing the permeability of construction 
materials (simultaneously reducing long-term infrastructure maintenance costs) to deal with excessive 
runoff (NACTO, 2012).

Another example includes zoning amendments or changes to construction requirements based 
on floodplain mapping, avoiding routing transportation through vulnerable areas, or requiring that 
infrastructure be elevated above a certain point (AMEC Inc., 2011). Municipalities increasingly 
recognize that by considering land-use and transportation at the same time, vulnerability to changing 
environmental conditions may be reduced (Larrivée, 2010).

STRUCTURAL AND PHYSICAL ADAPTATIONS 

Perhaps the most tangible adaptation category, these strategies include engineering-based 
solutions to enhance the physical resiliency of urban transportation networks. To adapt to more 
frequent and intense rainfall events, practitioners may widen road culverts, shoulders, and ditches to 
improve stormwater management and sheet flow, and construct deeper gravel wells under roads 
and rails (Savonis et al., 2008). Flood risks due to sea level rise and storm surge can be mitigated by 
constructing dykes and employing other flood-management techniques around low-lying urban 
areas to protect roads and highways (AMEC Inc., 2011; Mills, 2016).

To adapt to changing temperatures, municipalities may employ alternative, more heat- and rut-
resistant pavement materials, as well as rut-resistant pavement designs (i.e. thinner surfaces) (Andrey 
and Mills, 2003; United States Federal Highway Administration, 2015). For example, the Ontario Ministry 
of Transportation’s “SuperPave” system is a materials selection system that uses local weather-station 
data and pavement-performance data to dictate appropriate heat- and rutting-resistant asphalt 
mixes for provincial highways and some municipalities in Ontario (Ontario Ministry of Transportation, 
2013) (see Chapter 6). The City of Toronto has also installed cooling fans for traffic signals, and 
intelligent transportation system (ITS) infrastructure, to reduce risks from heat (City of Toronto, 2011). 

For transportation infrastructure built on warming permafrost in northern cities, adaptation strategies 
include mechanical stabilization of embankments and the removal of permafrost before construction; 
however these methods are extremely costly (Cheng, 2005; United States Arctic Research Commission 
Task Force, 2003). Snow sheds, air ducts, and thermosyphons can also protect roads and rail lines from 
warming temperatures (Reimchen et al., 2009). Dawson City has installed light-coloured pavement 
on the city’s main street to increase the reflectivity and reduce the impact of higher temperatures on 
permafrost (Walsh et al., 2009).

Other structural/physical adaptations include:

• 

Installing backup power infrastructure for overhead electricity (i.e. for trolleybuses, streetcars) and 
signals (McLeod and Stevanovic-Briatico, 2014).

•  Elevating roadways and rail lines in flood-prone areas (AMEC Inc., 2011; Koatse and Rietveld, 2012). 

•  Undertaking comprehensive “flood-proofing” of transit corridors, in which culverts are replaced 

and flood sensors are installed on rail infrastructure (Transportation and the Environment Task 
Force, 2014).

•  Waterproofing circuit breaker houses and other underground facilities that provide power to 

subways (McLeod and Stevanovic-Briatico, 2014).

 
CHAPTER 9: URBAN 

290
290

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016•  Performing regular maintenance of stormwater management systems, especially culverts, to 
maintain capacity, and designing drainage systems to direct runoff away from the roadbed 
(rather than parallel with the roadway), therefore avoiding erosion of the roadbed and exposure 
of utilities (City of Toronto, 2014).

•  Maintaining positive cross-slope to facilitate the flow of water from road surfaces, and increasing 

culvert/ditch capacities (United States Federal Highway Administration, 2015).

•  Sealing and/or elevating where appropriate street-level vents and manholes, protecting 

underground pump rooms, circuit breaker houses and other underground facilities that provide 
power to subway systems (McLeod and Stevanovic-Briatico, 2014).

•  Elevating portions of vulnerable roads, sidewalks and bicycle paths above projected sea-level or 

flood lines (Schwartz, 2011).

INSTITUTIONAL ADAPTATION

Institutional adaptation refers to the adoption of policies targeting climate change. This includes 
changes to transportation agencies’ service delivery, and approaches to infrastructure maintenance. 
For instance, on rail lines experiencing buckling, service or speed reductions might be implemented at 
least in the short term to ensure safety (Savonis et al., 2008). This category also includes:

• 

Innovative financing measures available to municipalities for adaptation, such as:

 -

 -

 -

“Green” bonds (debt instruments used to raise private capital for projects with specific 
environmental purposes, including urban transit and active transportation);

Local tax rebates or incentives for green roofs and other stormwater management 
infrastructure and practices, which may produce benefits for transportation in terms of 
reduced runoff; and,

Intergovernmental grants targeted for resilient transportation infrastructure (Harford et al., 
2015).

•  Organizational practices identified through the PIEVC (Public Infrastructure Engineering 

Vulnerability Committee) climate change vulnerability assessment protocol. For example, 
recommendations from a PIEVC assessment of impacts related to higher temperatures and 
increased precipitation on roads and associated structures in Sudbury included the following:

 - More closely monitoring hydraulic data for culverts, as well as key pavement performance 

indicators (e.g., freeze-thaw cycles, average and extreme temperatures) annually; 

 - Changing pavement mixtures to better withstand heat (i.e. SuperPave);

 -

 -

Performing sensitivity analyses on the slope stability of high-risk embankments; and,

Improving tree coverage on low-speed roads to reduce the urban heat island effect 
(Engineers Canada, 2014).

•  Organizational planning, financial and risk management practices. One example is the work 

undertaken by TransLink to integrate climate risk into decision-making processes, which is a 
responsibility of their Chief Financial Officer (see Case Study 5).

• 

Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). These are becoming more prevalent, and have potential 
adaptive applications in urban centres. ITS technologies can help municipalities “adaptively 
manage” traffic flow, infrastructure maintenance practices, and investment patterns through the 
collection of data on operations, structural integrity of infrastructure, and other variables, including 

 
CHAPTER 9: URBAN 

291
291

operations and save money with the assistance of real-time information (Fu et al., 2009). An 
example is the use of Roadway Information Systems in some Canadian cities, which provide real-
time road condition and usage information for municipalities (Clean Air Partnership, 2012).

• 

Ice-reduction practices. Research suggests that “anti-icing, pre-wet salting with plowing and 
sanding all reduce accident occurrence” (Andrey et al., 2013) during icy road conditions. To 
avoid or resolve environmental issues related to increased salt use for icy roads, municipalities in 
Ontario have employed alternative, lower-impact melt solutions (i.e. beet juice, cheese brine) 
(Clean Air Partnership, 2012).

SOCIAL ADAPTATIONS

These adaptations include strategies designed to leverage social networks to increase awareness and 
response time during extreme events. For instance, many municipalities now use social media to help 
communicate travel advisories and alerts for road and active transportation infrastructure conditions 
(e.g., flooding) and public transit service delays during extreme weather events (Mims, 2010; White et 
al., 2009). Table 2 provides an overview of adaptation practices identified in this chapter. 

The section to follow presents five case studies describing specific transportation adaptation 
approaches in Canadian cities, including discussion of where and how adaptations have been 
applied, benefits, costs, tradeoffs, and lessons-learned.

CASE STUDY 1: AN INNOVATIVE TOOL TO ASSESS CLIMATE 
RISKS AT THE CITY OF TORONTO 

Adaptation is critical for large cities’ transportation networks, given the social and economic importance of 
safe and fluid mobility. The City of Toronto anticipates that climate-related risks to its transportation system 
will significantly increase in coming decades (City of Toronto, 2008). Decisions made today regarding 
capital investments, program delivery, and relationships with key partners will be important to ensure that 
the City improves its resilience to climate change. 

This reasoning underpinned the City of Toronto’s decision to develop a Climate Change Adaptation 
Strategy. Toronto’s City Council provided the necessary political capital, resulting in a report and program 
entitled “Ahead of the Storm: Preparing Toronto for Climate Change” (City of Toronto, 2008). This was 
a screening-level, cross-cutting exercise in assessing organizational vulnerability to climate change, 
including a review of international best-practices and tools. Transportation was a key focus area of a multi-
stakeholder working group, featuring participants both internal and external to the City of Toronto. The 
resulting report recommended the development of a practical tool for assessing vulnerabilities and risks to 
the city’s transportation infrastructure and operations, in the context of both extreme weather events and 
slow-onset climate change. The City selected a consultant consortium to create a Climate Change Risk 
Assessment Tool and Process (CCRAT). This software application enables service and infrastructure providers 
to identify and prioritize key environmental and climate change-related risks, as well as to assess the 
benefits of various mitigation and adaptation actions.

The City of Toronto’s Transportation Services Division (TSD) demonstrated leadership and helped develop 
and apply the CCRAT pilot. The outputs included an overview document, an assessment process, a 
software tool, and a user manual. This was a ground breaking exercise for the City. Prior to this undertaking, 
the City did not know if it was feasible to deploy a risk assessment tool with available resources and 
knowledge. 

In 2011, TSD applied CCRAT to evaluate the vulnerability and resilience of 90 high-priority assets and critical 
services to seven extreme weather events. Through a series of 15 half-day workshops, 14 risk assessors,  
looked at 1650 impact scenarios for the time periods 2010-2020 and 2040-2050. The team developed 
“risk scenarios” (combinations of extreme weather events and impacts) based on identified causes and 
vulnerabilities. Impacts could be multiple or cascading (i.e., up to “four-order impacts”), for example, 
economic impacts resulting from transportation delays caused by road or lane closures during extreme 
weather events. TSD’s risk assessors also identified more than 60 existing initiatives that enhance adaptive 
capacity, as well as 100 short- and long-term adaptation actions. Examples of ongoing initiatives include:

•  Adding heating and cooling fans in traffic signal controllers; 

•  Developing guidelines for the construction of “green” streets; 

•  Coordinating efforts to enhance the urban canopy to reduce heat-island effects; and,

•  Using combination ploughing and salting vehicles to better react to freezing rain conditions (City of 

Toronto Environment Office, 2011).

The development and application of the CCRAT was an opportunity for the municipality to demonstrate its 
due diligence to citizens, and build organizational awareness. Another key output was the city’s Climate 
Change Risk Management Policy, which established an institutional foundation for adaptation. 

Practitioners involved with the CCRAT consider it a success. The use of both top-down (city-driven) and 
bottom-up (grassroots) approaches where appropriate was considered particularly beneficial, as was 
the establishment of a well-defined work program in which roles and responsibilities of all stakeholders 
were clearly delineated. Each functional group within TSD developed clearly-defined expectations for the 
services they deliver and the infrastructure they maintain. The appointment of specially-trained risk assessors 
for each group was viewed as integral to organizational cohesion. Selecting a chief risk assessor as a

project manager – a team leader experienced with environmental management systems, risk assessment, 
and a comprehensive understanding of the organizational structure – was also crucial. 

A number of lessons were learned:

•  Practitioners suggest the CCRAT would have been more effective if interdependencies and “synergistic 
risks” between the public and private sectors (such as energy, communication, insurance and finance) 
were identified prior to its undertaking. Engagement and collaboration with these sectors reduces the 
risk of economic disruption to the community and enables opportunities for more adaptive and resilient 
infrastructure. 

•  Another potential shortcoming was that “residual risk” (the degree of risk that remains once an 

adaptation has been implemented) was not assessed for each proposed adaptation action as part of 
this phase. Residual-risk analysis and cost-benefit analysis can be useful and important mechanisms to 
assist municipal managers in prioritizing adaptation actions. 

•  Practitioners also identified challenges in effectively communicating the severity of climate change to 

the public. The Royal Academy of Engineering (2011) notes the importance of consulting users of the 
assets and services regarding potential new service levels in addition to the amount tax payers would 
agree to pay for a particular level of service. A significant challenge for both industry and politicians 
is how to best communicate to the public the limits of resilience and the need to modify demand for 
infrastructure.   

Overall, the CCRAT has helped Toronto set clearer organizational goals on the issue of climate adaptation, 
and allows TSD to manage its assets and services in accordance with City Council’s priorities of customer-
service excellence and cost reduction in a transparent and fully-accountable manner. Critically, many 
of the adaptations CCRAT identified do not require major increases in capital or operating budgets. For 
instance, enhancing inventory databases, adopting environmental management systems, providing 
training, and improving coordination to reflect “best-management” principles and increase both adaptive 
capacity and organizational efficiency, involve little or no extra cost for the municipality. This is an example 
of “low-regret” adaptation. Focus is now shifting to ambitious, long-term actions which require additional 
investment. The summer of 2014 saw a high level of council support for these actions (such as a new culvert 
management system, approved for $350,000 to inventory all culverts less than 3m (in width) in the city’s 
road network. In sum, the City of Toronto considers the CCRAT useful for both private and public sectors to 
assess their vulnerabilities to climate change and develop an adaptation path to resiliency.

CASE STUDY 2: CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION AT THE CITY 
OF MONCTON
Many Maritime cities have already begun experiencing climate-related impacts. In Moncton, New Brunswick, 
the frequency of flooding from extreme storm events and changing tidal patterns has increased over the past 
decade (City of Moncton, 2013). Moncton is located at the nexus of the Petitcodiac River and the Bay of Fundy, 
a region that experiences one of the largest tidal ranges in the world. Coastal and inland flooding, as well as 
erosion, pose significant risks to transportation infrastructure. The region is also expected to experience gradual 
sea-level rise and significant precipitation and temperature increases by mid-century (AMEC Inc., 2011). 

From 2010 to 2012, communities in the Greater Moncton Area participated in the Atlantic portion of the 
Regional Adaptation Collaborative (RAC) program. This cost-sharing initiative with provincial and federal 
governments was designed to identify climate-change threats, vulnerabilities, and adaptation tools useful 
in addressing erosion, coastal and inland flooding, infrastructure design, and groundwater management. 
Transportation was an area of focus within this initiative, largely in recognition of historical problems in the 
region with transportation and sanitary-sewer infrastructure located below flood thresholds. 

Specific recommendations for the City of Moncton emerging from the RAC exercise, were to: 

•  Develop new arterial roads to avoid low-lying areas and the floodplain of the Petitcodiac and its tributaries; 

• 

• 

Elevate new roadway and bridge infrastructure to ensure access to essential services during extreme 
weather events;

Flood-proofing major roads at vulnerable elevations to minimize flood-related damage and ensure 
rapid system recovery; and,

•  Mandate higher flood elevations in future transportation planning decisions (AMEC Inc., 2011). A 

minimum elevation of 10.5 metres was proposed to reflect the 100-year flood event line the region is 
likely to experience by 2100, informed by floodplain mapping.

In response, the City of Moncton produced a corporate Climate Change Adaptation and Flood Management 
Strategy in 2013, and has since introduced a series of policy changes. For example, the City:

•  Changed its zoning bylaw to set minimum floor elevations for habitable space at 10.5 m;

•  Will elevate new roadways and bridges, where feasible to do so, above the 10.5-m threshold;

•  Developed extensive evacuation plans for existing vulnerable roadways in the event of a major storm 

surge event; and

•  Offers a $500 rebate on the installation of an approved backwater valve, as part of an incentive 

program for local property owners.

Building on these initiatives, Moncton has developed a Regional Sustainable Transportation Master Plan that 
will help the City assess the vulnerability of all transportation modes in the network using detailed mobility 
and flood scenarios. The results will help the City prioritize network improvements and street upgrades. The 
models and flood scenarios allow for provincial officials to identify their interests (provincial infrastructure in the 
community) likely to be affected under future conditions. Recommendations will be made to council regarding 
infrastructure requiring upgrading or abandonment, with budgetary requirements made clear.

The effectiveness and timeliness of Moncton’s adaptation planning, policies, and practices can be 
attributed to the support for adaptation from all levels of government. At the municipal level, the Climate 
Change Action Committee, composed of staff from most City departments, reports to council annually.  
Practitioners agree that it has done an excellent job of creating accountability on climate adaptation both 
within and between departments. Developing an integrated approach both within the municipality and 
with provincial and federal partners has proven invaluable.

CASE STUDY 3: TRANSPORTATION ADAPTATIONS TO CLIMATE 
CHANGE IN THE CITY OF WHITEHORSE, YUKON

Whitehorse is a significant regional transportation hub, with rail, marine, and air transportation all playing 
important roles in the city’s history. The city relies heavily on the Alaska Highway for external connectivity 
and on the automobile for urban mobility, although public transit services are also available. The city’s 
climate is relatively warm (compared to other northern communities) and semi-arid due to its location 
within the range shadow of coastal mountains. In recent years, however, Whitehorse has experienced 
highly variable precipitation, including many winters with above-average snowfall. Climate changes of 
this nature pose a number of risks to the city’s transportation network. Projected increases in wildfires and 
the intensity, duration, and frequency of storm events (and associated flood and drainage concerns) 
create indirect risks to road traffic. Local officials identify highway obstructions and washouts during 
extreme weather events as a key concern, as they can prevent the delivery of food and other essential 
goods. Other impacts to urban transportation include increased frequency of freeze-thaw cycles; strain 
on the road-maintenance budget in high-snowfall winters; and, greater stress on culverts due to increased 
summer and winter precipitation.

To address these concerns, the City of Whitehorse participated in the development of the community-
based Whitehorse Climate Change Adaptation Plan in 2011 (Hennessey and Streicker, 2011). This project 
involved a diversity of community stakeholders. While not legally-binding (the document is policy-relevant, 
but not policy-determinate) the plan has helped to “mainstream” the changing climate into municipal 
decision-making processes, meaning that climate data and projections are incorporated into investment 
and planning decisions. The plan’s broad goals include enhancing transit’s mode share, intensifying 
development, and increasing the region’s share of agricultural production through food security planning 
(including the production of more food in nearby greenhouses, reducing reliance on imports). Suggested 
adaptations for urban transportation include:

• 

Establishing annual budgets aimed at managing climate change concerns, including planning for 
increased snow removal requirements; 

• 

Expanding the use of road monitoring stations; 

•  Conducting exploratory feasibility studies of automatic road de-icing techniques; and

• 

Increasing the porosity of road surfaces to improve re-charge following precipitation. 

These adaptations include both “low-regret” and “no-regret” measures. For example, when road 
improvements are required due to the lifecycle or condition of the infrastructure, the Plan suggests that 
the City upgrade water and sewer systems to accommodate larger stormwater flows. This requires only a 
modest marginal-cost increase to the budget for the project. At the same time, this strategy means only 
those roads nearing the end of their lifespan or in very poor repair will be adapted in the near-term, given 
that the cost of replacing usable infrastructure with larger drainage capacity is prohibitive. For practical 
purposes, this is an adaptation approach that must be implemented in a piecemeal manner. A “no-regret” 
adaptation on the operational side involves proactive early-spring inspections of drainage to identify 
frozen storm drains and reduce flood risks. 

Flooding is also a concern on Whitehorse’s residential roadways, with some older subdivisions having 
experienced localized issues as a result of outdated drainage systems. As a result, stormwater infrastructure 
in new subdivisions is now designed with higher volume thresholds. Additionally, Whitehorse is using 
transportation redundancy as an adaptation solution on a small scale; subdivisions are no longer permitted 
to be built with only one road-access point in case of washouts, flooding, and wildfire hazards.

CASE STUDY 4: ROAD SAFETY AND CLIMATE CHANGE IN 
PRINCE GEORGE

Prince George, located in the interior of British Columbia, is home to approximately 76,000 people. The 
city has a wide range of transportation modes, including rail, inland marine, and urban transit. While the 
city’s transportation network faces a number of risks from climate change, warmer winter temperatures 
are likely to have the greatest impact, primarily due to increased freeze-thaw cycles, rain-on-snow events, 
and freezing rain. Flooding on the Nechako (due to ice jams) and Fraser (due to freshet) rivers is another 
key concern. Prince George developed a number of transportation-specific climate change adaptations 
in 2012, in recognition of the risks flooding poses to roads, active transportation infrastructure, and rail 
facilities. This was done in the context of a larger community adaptation plan.

A steering committee composed of local practitioners and experts from academia (to balance local 
needs with best practices) identified 23 forward-looking adaptation actions, in the areas of infrastructure, 
operations, emergency response and safety, and financing. 

Through the process, the city also identified a number of ongoing initiatives that fall under the umbrella of 
climate adaptation. These included snow and ice control, salt management, road elevation, and dyke 
construction. For instance, following an ice-jam flood of an industrial area in 2008, the city elevated a 
roadway to a 1-in-200 year flood level, and constructed a 3.3 km dyke to protect local rail infrastructure 
(Picketts, 2012). The committee’s final recommendations for immediate action included changes to winter 
road maintenance, improvements to road safety, and climate-sensitive design considerations (Picketts, 2012). 
The city listed transportation as its highest-priority area in the city for continued action (Picketts et al., 2013). 

Prince George is now focused on implementing action items in key areas, with promising early returns. The 
city has begun to aggregate climate data and procedural information to better inform road maintenance 
decision-making, including data on vehicle and climate interactions. With respect to road design and 
stormwater management, a number of new permeable materials have been proposed for testing. Next 
steps include:

•  Continuing partnerships with universities and the provincial government; 

• 

• 

Encouraging climate assessments for all new infrastructure projects; 

Incorporating climate data into decision-making criteria; 

•  Maintaining dialogue with the transportation industry; and,

• 

Encouraging the exchange of information among city staff members (Picketts, 2012).

The transportation component was considered successful by practitioners, given the high degree of public 
interest in mobility issues; the practical nature of the solutions that were explored; and the clear potential 
for significant cost savings. However, one drawback to the project’s focus on winter road safety was 
relatively little attention was paid to active and public modes of transportation (Picketts, 2014). Feedback 
from practitioners involved in the implementation process highlighted four key areas for attention, with 
specific relevance to adaptation in mid-sized, northern communities:  

1.  Building and maintaining local knowledge and capacity for decision-making around climate 

adaptation; 

2.  “Mainstreaming” or normalizing adaptation into the plans, priorities, and professional practices of local 

officials; 

3.  Focusing on tangible projects around which the community can rally and easily identify results; and; 

4.  Linking adaptation actions to costs and priorities through clear communication to both politicians and 

members of the public (Picketts, 2014).

This case study demonstrates how communities can successfully incorporate rigorous climate analysis 
into vulnerability assessments, shifting discussion from a general recognition of risks to the identification of 
explicit actions (Picketts, 2013). Achieving greater teamwork and the adoption of common goals within 
the municipal organization were also considered critical to sustaining the momentum this initiative has 
generated.1

CASE STUDY 5:  ACCOUNTING FOR CLIMATE CHANGE RISKS 
AT TRANSLINK

TransLink is metropolitan Vancouver’s regional transportation authority, with a system of assets and services 
that incorporates bus, commuter rail, cycling and walking paths, and roads. This network provides about 
1.2 million trips per day.  

The organization considers managing climate change risks important to service delivery and infrastructure 
maintenance/development, particularly given that it builds infrastructure to last 100 years. Projected 
population growth in the region is expected to compound these risks – Metro Vancouver is expected to grow 
by one million people over the next 30 years, placing greater demand on the region’s transportation system. 

TransLink began considering climate change impacts in 2010 and conducted a climate change 
vulnerability assessment of its assets in 2012 in support of its Asset Management Plan. Through this process, 
the organization identified the following key climate change risks to its services:

• 

Sea level rise, that could:  

 -

 -

 -

Flood assets now within “expanded” floodplains, 

Reduce clearance under bridges

Impair operations of the SeaBus (ferry) terminal.

• 

Increased precipitation that could cause temporary flooding of TransLink’s assets, such as bus loops, 
tunnels, transit stations and trolley electricity conversion (“rectifier”) stations.  

•  Warmer temperatures, and more frequent and severe heat waves, that could affect passenger health 

and comfort on parts of the fleet without air-conditioning.

TransLink has also ensured that its Finance department and accountants play a core role in its adaptation 
efforts. The Chief Financial Officer (CFO) is responsible for seeing that climate change risks are considered 
in TransLink’s decision-making process. TransLink considers this structure effective as it embeds climate 
change throughout the organization, with links to risk management, strategic sourcing, capital planning 
and review processes, and reporting.

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 20167.0 INTERDEPENDENCIES WITH OTHER URBAN SECTORS

Urban transportation networks depend on other infrastructure and utilities, (including electricity and 
telecommunications) to move large volumes of people and goods efficiently. The interdependencies 
among these systems, the economy, and society are explored in this section.  

Electricity is one key interdependency. Growing dependence on the electrical grid for urban mobility 
(particularly for LRT and commuter rail systems, but also for automobiles and infrastructure) can 
create multi-sectoral vulnerability when extreme weather events disrupt the supply and distribution of 
electrical power. Ensuring traffic signals remain operational during and immediately following extreme 
weather is another concern.  

Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) applications, used heavily for public transit and traffic 
management, also depend upon telecommunications infrastructure that can be affected by extreme 
weather (Revi et al., 2014). Without adequate coordination, interactions between water mains and 
underground public transit systems can potentially disrupt both sectors. This is the case under both 
slow-onset climate change and during extreme weather events. For example, pipes can freeze 
and rupture during freeze-thaw cycles or extreme cold conditions damaging the water distribution 
infrastructure and disrupting the underground public transit systems. This has been experienced by the 
Toronto Transit Commission’s subway system in recent winters (McLeod and Stevanovic-Briatico, 2014).

The ability of transportation agencies to reduce damages associated with severe weather is therefore 
affected by how other municipal divisions and utility providers (e.g., telecommunications and energy 
supply) integrate climate change considerations into their own planning and service delivery. If one 
sector is at risk, so are many others. For example, if floods or heat waves disrupt the energy supply, 
all other services can be affected, causing failures to cascade. If road traffic is not flowing freely, the 
efficiency of an entire city may be reduced. 

In locations where infrastructure is at risk of being compromised or failing as a result of climate 
impacts, Business Continuity Planning becomes important. This refers to planning that ensures services 
are not compromised by extreme or unforeseen events. Planning in advance how the workforce can 
be more effectively deployed in emergency and post-emergency situations is critical, particularly 
since climate change is anticipated to bring more frequent extreme weather events. Practitioners 
interviewed for this chapter indicated that interdepartmental coordination can be improved if 
decision-makers work closely with city engineers and technical advisory committees on climate 
adaptation strategies for transportation infrastructure and operations. 

For example, the City of Toronto’s Transportation Services Division (TSD) has collaborated with a 
number of other municipal sectors and agencies on climate change adaptation and preparedness 
activities. Table 3 identifies these ongoing initiatives. Interdependencies between sectors identified 
by TSD include power outages caused by extreme heat, wind, and freezing rain, as well as impacts 
on the traffic control system and communication infrastructure. Transportation practitioners suggest 
that a climate change risk assessment of the electricity sector would help to identify areas of the City 
most vulnerable under various climate scenarios. This information would inform the implementation 
and spatial deployment of adaptation measures, such as uninterruptable power supply technology to 
traffic control signals. 

Disruptions to road and transit networks will also affect the ability of staff to travel to work, resulting 
in personnel shortages and, ultimately, impacts to municipal service delivery. Business continuity 
planning for extreme weather events can address these issues, by planning for alternative work 
arrangements, periodic training,  trial-testing of emergency management procedures, and 
maintaining an emergency contact information database for staff (held by a supervisor and 
accessible at all times).

• 

• 

This tool identifies and assesses risks due to climate change, including the 
effect of climate change on the delivery of services, management of 
infrastructure and protection of the natural environment. 
The CCRA enables service and infrastructure providers to identify and 
prioritize key climate change impacts and risks, and assess benefits of various 
risk mitigation or adaptive actions. 

Examples of some collaborative initiatives include:

a)  TSD developed a harmonized process for implementing concrete bus bays 
and stops; asphalt pavement surfaces at bus stops generally exhibit severe 
distortion (e.g., rutting) due to bus loads and extreme heat conditions;  
Installation of concrete bus pads on the roadway as part of resurfacing 
projects. These are typically applied only in situations where the existing 
asphalt surface is shoving or rutting moderately (>25mm) or more;

b) 

c)  TSD identified and prioritized 100 traffic signal locations for the installation of 

uninterruptable power supply (UPS) devices, including signals at railroads, 
major intersections and expressway ramp terminals. A pilot program was 
initiated to outfit 12 high-priority locations. 

d)  A second-phase review is underway to identify UPS needs for critical 

intersections located on emergency routes; and 

e)  TSD established contracted services for mobile diesel and gas trucks; third

Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Climate Risks & Adaptation Practices - For the Canadian Transportation Sector 2016Outside of municipal departments, there is also a need to fully engage urban civil society and provide 
information about the importance of adaptation to the public (Larrivée, 2010). Practitioners suggest 
that public engagement on adaptation tends to yield conversations about climate mitigation (the 
reduction of carbon emissions). The task of municipal agencies is to emphasize the importance of 
both policies in tandem to maximize social value from infrastructure investments. Public engagement 
is also necessary to prepare society to function – access jobs, health care and other activities – when 
transportation systems or infrastructure systems are performing at lower levels.  

8.0 GAPS AND BARRIERS

Practitioners suggest that without buy-in from the executive to operational levels on the severity of 
climate change risks, adaptation planning efforts often fail to be fully implemented. In some instances, 
practitioners have found success by communicating the importance of avoiding more significant 
costs in future through proactive investments. Cost-benefit analysis can also support adaptation 
decisions, by helping practitioners prioritize infrastructure-upgrade investments and demonstrate the 
value of actions taken to reduce future vulnerability (Feltmate and Thistlethwaite, 2012). As more cities 
achieve and communicate long-term cost savings and economic competitiveness from adaptation 
measures, barriers to the widespread introduction of these measures are reduced.

Coordinating actions among multiple levels of government, agencies, and sectors is another 
challenge to adaptive decision-making. For example, municipal governments facing flood risks must 
coordinate emergency-response with other orders of government, in addition to dealing with the 
challenges of flood prevention and physical protection (Chiwizer and Tarlock, 2013). 

9.0 CONCLUSION

This chapter has demonstrated many ways in which urban transportation networks are vulnerable 
to climate change and extreme weather, and has identified efforts that Canadian cities are making 
to manage these risks. While municipalities have historically taken adaptive action in the wake of 
catastrophes, the case studies identified in this chapter suggest that increasingly, municipalities and 
their partners are working to proactively adapt both infrastructure and operations in advance of 
climate impacts. Case studies in the chapter provide examples of Canadian urban regions engaging 
in vulnerability assessments, structural and physical improvements, and organizational change to 
improve their resiliency to a rapidly changing transportation environment. The literature identifies 
additional adaptation approaches that may be applied by transportation professionals in Canada, 
as appropriate. It is clear that solutions will involve an appropriate mix of proactive and reactive 
adaptations.  

This chapter has also highlighted the importance of redundancy (of both routes and modes) to 
enhance resiliency, as well as the importance of “low-regret” adaptation strategies in building 
support for adaptation efforts within governments and communities. The high up-front costs of 
many adaptation strategies (particularly structural solutions) may be a deterrent, and the complex 
fiscal and operational environments of modern cities pose obstacles to adaptation. Therefore, it is 
increasingly important for transportation practitioners to work in collaboration with other municipal 
sectors towards common adaptation goals. With strong cooperative efforts, Canada’s multimodal 
urban transportation networks can more successfully meet the challenges of a changing climate.
