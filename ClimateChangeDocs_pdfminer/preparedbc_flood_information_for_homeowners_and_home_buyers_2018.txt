ADV I CE FO R PROTEC TING YO UR H OME AND PRO PER T Y

Flooding is a common, naturally occurring event in B.C. Although it 
can happen at any time of year, the most severe floods typically occur 
in spring—known as freshet—or during fall and winter. This seasonal 
flooding is usually caused by heavy rain and snowmelt.

Homes may be at risk when flood water spreads to adjoining areas 
that are normally dry. Depending on the type and severity of flooding, 
it could take hours, weeks and potentially months for the water to 
recede and the clean-up to begin. The advice provided in this guide 
will help to make informed choices when purchasing a home or 
working to protect it.

ADVICE FOR PROTECTING YOUR HOME AND PROPERTYPreparedBCPurchasing a home

When buying a home, it is important to know if the property is in a 
flood-prone area. Here are some things to do and questions to ask:

  Contact your local government and ask if flood-hazard mapping is 
available and what the flood construction level (FCL) is for the area.

  Complete a home inspection to see if the home has been subject 

to past flooding. This can include hiring a qualified professional, 
such as a hydraulic or hydrotechnical engineer, to conduct a 
property assessment.

  Speak with neighbours to learn more about the area’s history.

ADVICE FOR PROTECTING YOUR HOME AND PROPERTYProtecting your home and property

If you do purchase (or have already purchased) a home in a flood-prone 
area, there are many ways you can reduce the risk of water damage.

Simple, inexpensive actions include:

  Storing valuable and important items or documents on upper 

floors.

  Anchoring fuel sources.

  Sealing cracks in the foundation and around doors and windows.

  Installing backflow valves on basement floor drains, washing 

machine drains, toilets and sink drains.

  Installing a sump pump.

When making improvements to your home, consider the following:

  Tiled floors with waterproof adhesive and grout.

  Flood-resistant exterior doors.

  Raising electrical sockets on the first floor.

  Flood-resistant drywall.

  Moving large appliances, furnaces, hot water heaters and 

electrical panels out of the basement or ground floor and above 
the FCL. Alternatively, use risers to keep them off the floor.

  Permeable paving surfaces for sidewalks and driveways.

  Installing permanent safeguards, such as self-closing flood 

barriers, designed to keep water out of your home for as long as 
possible.

It takes two people about one hour to fill and place 100 sandbags, 
giving you a 1-x-20-foot wall. Make sure you have enough sand, burlap 
or plastic bags, shovels and time to properly prepare. Contact your local 
government for information on obtaining sandbags.

ADVICE FOR PROTECTING YOUR HOME AND PROPERTYIf you are facing imminent flooding, move electrical appliances to upper 
floors and make sure to anchor fuel supplies, such as oil tanks. Tune in 
to local radio and TV channels for information on sandbagging stations, 
possible evacuation procedures and reception centres.

Never attempt to drive or walk in flood water. A mere six inches of fast-
moving water can knock over an adult. Two feet of rushing water can 
carry away most vehicles, including SUVs and pick-up trucks.

If directed to evacuate 

  Gather your grab-and-go kit(s).

  Follow instructions from local officials via TV, radio or social 

media.

  Move to a safe location outside the impacted area.

  Return home only when authorities say it is safe to do so.

ADVICE FOR PROTECTING YOUR HOME AND PROPERTYPreparedBCAfter a flood

Following a flood, it is important to restore your home as soon as 
possible to protect your health and prevent further property damage. 
While cleaning up you should: 

  Be aware of areas where floodwaters have receded, keeping an 

eye out for debris. 

  Be aware that floodwaters often erode roads and walkways, 

making them less stable.

  Never drive through areas that are still flooded.

  Avoid standing water as it may be electrically charged from 

underground or downed power lines.

  Photograph damage to your property and speak to your 

insurance agent.
