Guidelines for Sea Dikes and Coastal Flood Hazard Land Use 1 1.1 Introduction and Application of This Document General This document provides guidelines for the management of lands that are exposed to coastal flood hazards arising from their exposure to the sea and to expected sea level rise due to climate change.\n","8:  This document will supersede the related sections of the existing _Land Use Guidelines 2004_, which means the Flood Hazard Area Land Use Management Guidelines, May 2004, prepared by the Ministry of Water, Land and Air Protection (now Ministry of Environment).\n","15:  The relaxed flood-proofing must be compatible with the design of the sea dikes.\n","19:  Analysis of flooding hazards from all sources _ rivers and the sea - will be required in estuaries.\n","21:  1 Draft Policy Discussion Paper - Climate Change Adaptation Guidelines for Sea Dikes and Coastal Flood Hazard Land Use in BC.\n","23:  2 Sea Dike Guidelines - Climate Change Adaptation Guidelines for Sea Dikes and Coastal Flood Hazard Land Use in BC.\n","37:  The reference point can be estimated by defining: 1.\n","53:  To protect the large investment that buildings involve, and respecting current trends in SLR, a precautionary principle is followed to create the Recommended Curve for Sea Level Rise Policy in BC.\n","59:  Building Life Cycle and Sea Level Rise 3.2 In considering FCL in the face of an evolving sea level, it is necessary to consider the longevity of the buildings, structures or land use under consideration.\n","65:  This guideline should apply for the period from 2010 until the next SLR review, which should be completed by 2015.\n","68:  crustal uplift or subsidence) could be required.\n","79:  It should be noted that these preliminary values should vary due to a number of factors that are site specific, including: the local rate of crustal uplift or subsidence, the nature of the tides, anticipated local storm surge effects that depend on local bathymetry and the particulars of the anticipated storms associated with the storm surge.\n","82:  SLR Planning Areas should be established along the BC Coast to provide a basis for local calculations and guidance on required Flood Construction Levels, and to provide a basis for management of the expected ongoing increases in SLR as it affects land use and buildings.\n","92:  Land use and building approvals based on FCL for 2100 should also include provisions for adaptive management of land uses to Sea Level Rise to the Year 2200 and beyond.\n","94:  An Adaptive Risk Management Approach to SLR would plan how short term land uses and structures can be occupied with reasonable risk for their lifespan, but at the same time recognize and allow that future SLR may require the redesign to a higher elevation or relocation of the next generation of land uses and structures at a given coastal site.\n","96:  For example, a building constructed in 2010 with a 90 year lifespan would meet the guideline if sited to allow for SLR of 1.0 m minimum over Year 2000 levels plus or minus any regional adjustments.\n","98:  The actual required FCL in the year 2200 will not be known with accuracy until much closer to that date.\n","100:  This approach will minimize the initial costs of considering SLR, and the future costs of adaptation.\n","104:  SLR Planning Areas should be defined for both settled and new development areas that are at risk of SLR inundation or related erosion.\n","106:  Figure 4-1 illustrates in concept the proposed SLR Planning Areas.\n","107:  They would extend from the existing Natural Boundary of the sea landward to the contour elevation of a future Flood Construction Level (FCL).\n","109:  _ SLR Planning Area Year 2200 would extend from Natural Boundary at the sea to the guideline FCL elevation projected for Year 2200.\n","112:  Land use policies must then address the land needs required to upgrade the existing sea dikes.\n","114:  Each location may have a different allowance for High Tide, Sea Level Rise, Storm Surge, and Wave Effects which together with Freeboard determine the FCL.\n","115:  Planning policy and land use designations within the SLR Planning Area must consider how land uses can adapt to the projected future Flood Construction Levels.\n","124:  Some building uses may have a lifespan of shorter than 100 years.\n","128:  The guidelines and requirements in SLR Planning Areas will need to be reviewed in these same intervals, with a focus on updating FCL elevation requirements, which may move up or down as projections for SLR become more accurate.\n","129:  The term of SLR Plans will also move with the review intervals _ with the general intent that SLR planning looks ahead approximately 100 and 200 years from the date of the plan.\n","131:  Building Setbacks from the Sea In un-diked areas, SLR will have the long-term effect of moving the Natural Boundary landward.\n","132:  This effect will be more pronounced on gently sloping shorelines or low coastal benches than in steeper shoreline terrain or where bedrock is present.\n","133:  Coastal Bluffs will require special consideration.\n","134:  Sea Level Rise may increase the risk of coastal erosion and accelerate the retreat of shorelines.\n","137:  The rate of retreat will be highly dependent on the wind and wave characteristics at the site and the material of the shoreline and backshore bluffs.\n","138:  Where lands are to remain un-diked, setbacks for buildings from the sea must anticipate SLR for the lifespan of the building.\n","139:  Figure 4-4 illustrates SLR to the Year 2100 in a relatively flat and rolling shoreline condition.\n","142:  Building Setback should be established as _the greater of 15 m from the future Estimated Natural Boundary or a distance to where the native land elevation equals the Flood Construction Level_.\n","143:  This setback would apply to non-erodible bedrock cliffs as well as other shoreline types.\n","148:  Rebuilding on or after 2100 should undertake a MANAGED RETREAT, and respect the Year 2200 FCL and Setback.\n","150:  Short of relocating the building, preparing the lower parts of the building to ACCOMODATE flooding from the sea should be required _ through such measures as leaving only floodable uses such as parking on the lower floor, moving habitable quarters to the upper floor, or using water resistant materials on the lower floor.\n","152:  During planning for land use and development, careful mapping and planning strategies for SLR Planning Areas will minimize costs and

perspectives on whether the appropriate _social rate of time_ discount rate had been applied.\n","1194:  Statistical downscaling combines large-scale climate variables with locally observed variables (often from a specific weather station) to produce a statistical model that is then used to project future changes at a local scale.\n","1224:  These indicators are often evaluated quantitatively, for

the consequences of climate change impacts The important part of a climate change impact assessment should be not only obtaining information about changes in basic climatic variables such as temperature and precipitation, but also information on what these changes mean for the resources, infrastructure and vulnerability of areas relevant for the local government.\n","1302:  If the impacts are changes in temperature, runoff and other climatic conditions; these will lead to significant changes in species ranges, ecosystem structure and function The consequences could be issues such as: (cid:129) Changes in climatic conditions will cause shifts in the geographic ranges of species.\n","1306:  Increased competition for available water supplies with human uses during the summer or periods of drought will additionally stress ecosystems.\n","1323:  At the same time, sea level rise could raise the water table and result in the floating of sewers and foundations if they are not

capacity; however, adding higher capacity by additional actions or upgrading the infrastructure as part of the regular maintenance cycle would be prudent (cid:129) Rise in water table may also cause floating of sewers, foundations, etc that were not designed for those conditions (cid:129) Continual upgrades of water and sewage systems will be necessary, and additional energy may be required for pumping 72 CANADIAN COMMUNITIES_ GUIDEBOOK FOR ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE guidebook livia-rev-final:Layout 1 12/23/08 9:25 AM Page 73 APPENDIX 2 If the impacts are water supply shortages, temperature changes, changes in the number of growing days and in the frequency of natural disturbances; these will have both positive and negative implications for agriculture and food security If the impacts are a reduction in snowfall, this will pose challenges for winter sport industries, while beaches and natural parks will be faced with both challenges and opportunities in a changing climate The consequences could be issues such as: (cid:129) Projected changes in the local climate are generally expected to have positive impacts for agriculture in terms of the number of growing days, length of the growing season and potential to grow higher-value crops.\n","1329:  Moderate climate change will likely increase yields of rain-fed agriculture in North America by 5 to 20% over the first decades of the century (high confidence).\n","1331:  Potential for more spring flooding as well as summer drought conditions (lower soil moisture and streamflow) (cid:129) Changes in

(cid:129) Possible introduction of new agricultural pests and diseases The consequences could be issues such as: (cid:129) As winters become milder and less precipitation falls as snow, winter sport industries, notably the ski industry, will be negatively impacted.\n","1332:  As sea level rises, more severe weather and storm surges become more frequent, beaches and waterfront areas could erode or become submerged.\n","1339:  Interruptions to energy and transportation services can have large associated costs for the economy, as witnessed during the 2003 power outage in northeastern North

Identifying and obtaining the relevant information can be a challenge in and of itself but is one of many steps required to develop an adaptation framework (Figure 1).\n","4431:  DEFINING ADAPTATION AND DECISION-MAKER The term adaptation is used in this guide to refer to all processes, actions and strategies that allow individuals, communities, and organizations to cope with, manage, and adjust to changing climatic conditions such that risks are minimized and opportunities are seized10.\n","4433:  In exploring adaptation outcomes, which includes initiating activities that reduce

with the task of evaluating the impacts of climate change and/or of implementing adaptation measures.\n","4460:  The information presented will be particularly useful for users who have limited experience with climate information and climate services.\n","4461:  A better understanding of the available climate information will increase their ability to evaluate their particular needs and to either prepare the information themselves or to communicate their requirements to climate service providers.\n","4462:  Climate service providers will also benefit from the guide since it will help them better categorize demands in terms of the use or purpose of the climate information and acquire a better sense of the different types of climate formats that can be tailored according to user expertise.\n","4466:  HOW TO USE THIS GUIDE This guidebook is meant to appeal to a wide range of users and therefore contains information with varying levels of complexity.\n","4467:  Consequently, many will not need to read the entire document.\n","4472:  It may therefore be helpful to evaluate one_s needs in Chapter 2 and then use that information to focus on the associated climate information category in Chapter 3.\n","4474:  While the weather varies on a daily basis, climate captures variations on all time scales, from one decade or century to the next, and even on a seasonal and yearly basis (Figure 2).\n","4479:  Many such climatic phenomena that are part of real world natural variability emerge from climate model simulations but they often exhibit different statistical properties.\n","4487:  Given the natural variability in the climate, it will still be possible with climate change, to experience short terms trends that are opposite to the overall projected trend

Moreover, increased resolution (through the use of downscaling techniques for example) will not necessarily yield more useful information to the decision-maker.\n","4554:  Table 1 and Figure 5 can be

The definition of the _past period_ for which observed GHG emissions are available and used to drive climate models is updated with each new IPCC assessment.\n","4571:  To obtain a climate simulation, many different inputs are required in a climate model, such as a detailed portrait of the Earth_s surface including geophysical data (soil types, types of vegetation, continental contours, location and bathymetry of large bodies of water, description of the topography, etc.).\n","4574:  It is important to understand that none of these future climates should be considered a prediction: all the future climates projected by different climate models with different GHG forcing scenarios should be considered equally plausible.\n","4575:  The time span of a simulation can range from a few years to thousands of years, both for the past and future periods (Figure 7).\n","4576:  The length of time over which climate models are run to produce simulations differs from one climate center to another but can range for example from 1850 or 1900 to 2100 or even 2300 (see example of Figure 7).\n","4582:  ), which should all be physically consistent with one another from one point on the grid

models with different emissions scenarios.\n","4602:  A model can also be run multiple times with the same RCP with slight perturbations in the initial conditions, for example by changing the start date of the simulation to obtain what are called ensemble members.\n","4604:  GUIDEBOOK ON CLIMATE SCENARIOS | 16 1.6.1 COUPLED MODEL INTERCOMPARAISON PROJECT (CMIP) As discussed above, there are numerous climate modeling centers around the world, each developing their own climate model and there are currently four plausible emissions scenarios to consider when producing climate simulations.\n","4607:  Consequently, it would be impractical, if not impossible, for each climate modeling center to run all available models with all available RCPs.\n","4622:  These conclusions should reassure users that climate information provided using CMIP3 models remains valid and robust even if there is now a gradual shift towards use of CMIP5 model results.\n","4629:  Indeed, impacts studies conducted with an older ensemble should not be automatically disregarded when new simulations are made available.\n","4636:  important since this variability can be in opposition, at least for a few decades, to the longer-term trends that are associated with anthropogenic climate change (Figure 3).\n","4637:  It may take several decades before the climate _signal_ emerges from the _noise_ of year-to-year variability.\n","4651:  The planning horizon will also greatly impact the type of climate information that would be most appropriate.\n","4655:  The importance of relying on an iterative process of revisiting climate projections and re-evaluating adaptation measures put into place, as recommended by an adaptation framework, may be particularly beneficial here (Figure 1).\n","4686:  Moreover, some input from users and climate service providers can help the selection process in some cases37.\n","4695:  They may therefore not be representative of other indices over

planning.87,88 Accordingly, Provinces play a role in land use planning for local adaptation to climate change through _ enabling legislation _ Provinces enact and revise laws that guide planning by local and regional authorities.\n","6638:  Those standards may facilitate enhanced regional food security and the design of more resilient urban communities.\n","6639:  _ provincial adaptation plans and programs _ Many provinces have their own formal plans for adapting to climate change.\n","6643:  Finally, provinces fund programs that can support local adaptation (for example, subsidies for an

YOURSELF FLOODING IS THE MOST COMMON AND COSTLY DISASTER IN THE UNITED STATES AND CAN HAPPEN ANYWHERE.\n","7386:  As you begin to think about which might be the best for you and your home, consider following these three key steps: 1.\n","7387:  Know Your Risk.\n","7388:  Anywhere it can rain, it can food_so we all live in a food zone, and we all live with the risk of food damage to our property.\n","7389:  Learn more details about your home_s level of food risk, including the type of food zone it is in and, if available, the potential food elevation (referred to as the _base food elevation_ on a food map).\n","7391:  You can also visit the offcials in your community who maintain the FEMA food maps and elevation certifcates; they may work in the local planning and zoning offce or in the building department.\n","7392:  Talk to them, your neighbors, and others about any past food events and how high the water has risen in the past at or near your home.\n","7393:  Insure Your Property.\n","7394:  As a homeowner, it_s important to insure your home and personal belongings.\n","7395:  Even if your home is in a low- or moderate-risk food zone, purchasing a food insurance policy is highly recommended.\n","7400:  Reduce Your Risk.\n","7401:  Decide how to prepare your family and protect your home from fooding.\n","7404:  Please be aware that food mitigation measures need to be tailored to the property in question.\n","7408:  Lastly, please remember to be kind to your neighbors!\n","7409:  Consulting adjacent property owners is very important when any actions on your property, such as extending downspouts or regrading areas between homes, could affect their property.\n","7410:  _ Install a rain barrel.\n","7413:  You can use this stored water for non-potable uses such as watering the lawn and gardens or washing your car.\n","7414:  _ Elevate utilities and service equipment.\n","7415:  Raise and anchor air conditioning condensers, heat pumps, water meters and other service equipment onto pedestals or platforms that are at least 1 foot above the potential food elevation.\n","7417:  This inexpensive action can help prevent signifcant damage and disruption following a food event.\n","7418:  _ Anchor outdoor fuel tanks.\n","7419:  Attach outdoor fuel tanks to a large concrete slab that weighs enough to resist the force of foodwaters, or install inexpensive ground anchors that are connected across the top of the tank with metal straps.\n","7420:  Unanchored fuel tanks can be easily moved and ruptured by foodwaters and pose serious threats to people, property, and the environment.\n","7421:  If located in an identifed high- risk zone, fuel tanks should also be elevated to or above the regulatory food elevation as adopted by the local community.\n","7422:  If not feasible then all flling and ventilation tubes should be elevated so that foodwaters cannot enter the tank.\n","7423:  OUTSIDE THE HOME For the exterior areas of your property, consider taking the following actions: _ Maintain proper water runoff and drainage.\n","7424:  Routinely clean and maintain gutters, downspouts, and splashpads so that rainwater from your roof fows easily away from your home.\n","7425:  Also, make sure that any nearby drainage ditches or storm drains are clear of debris and functioning properly.\n","7426:  _ Improve lot grading.\n","7427:  Determine how water fows or accumulates around your home to identify potential trouble spots (often easy to see during an average rainstorm).\n","7428:  Stormwater should always drain away from the building; if necessary, change your landscaping to improve runoff.\n","7429:  This may include building up any sunken areas around the foundation, digging small depressions to properly channel water, and otherwise improving the yard so that it slopes away from your home.\n","7430:  _ Reduce impervious surfaces around your home.\n","7432:  Retaining and creating natural green space around your home can help reduce sewer overfows by reducing stormwater runoff.\n","7433:  Consider options such as rain gardens, vegetated swales, or pervious pavements, which allow more water to be absorbed by the ground.\n","7434:  INSIDE THE HOME For interior areas below the potential food elevation, consider making the following alterations: _ Protect your valuable possessions.\n","7435:  Move important documents and other valuable or sentimental items to a safer location, well above the potential food elevation and/or inside watertight containers.\n","7436:  _ Seal your foundation and basement walls.\n","7437:  Close any foundation cracks with mortar and masonry caulk or hydraulic cement, which expands and flls gaps completely.\n","7438:  Seal walls in your basements with waterproofng compounds to avoid seepage.\n","7439:  Make sure any foor drains are clear of obstructions.\n","7440:  _ Install food vents.\n","7443:  Flood openings may be required for lower enclosures of homes being built in high-risk food zones, but they can also be installed in existing homes.\n","7444:  Once installed, make sure your food vents are kept free of debris and will allow the free-fow of foodwater.\n","7445:  _ Install a sump pump.\n","7448:  Be sure to choose a device with battery-operated backup, in case of electrical power failure.\n","7449:  _ Prevent sewer backups.\n","7455:  FLOOD PREPAREDNESS You may be able to take additional actions immediately before an expected food event that will prevent or reduce food damage to your home: _ Activate food protection devices (turn on sump pumps, close backfow valves, etc.).\n","7456:  _ Shut off electricity at the breaker panel.\n","7457:  _ Safeguard important paperwork and move furniture, rugs, electronics, and other valuable belongings to upper foors, or at least off the foor of the ground level.\n","7458:  _ Elevate major appliances onto concrete blocks.\n","7460:  _ Deploy temporary food barriers, such as portable food gates or shields, sandbags, infatable foodwalls, and food skirts.\n","7461:  _ Replace wooden foorboards and carpets with ceramic tile, vinyl, rubber, or other food-resistant materials.\n","7462:  Use moveable rugs instead of ftted carpets.\n","7463:  _ Replace internal walls and ceilings with food-resistant material such as lime plaster, cement board, concrete, or pressure-treated and decay-resistant wood.\n","7464:  _ Replace wooden doors and window frames with metal or other food- resistant options.\n","7465:  _ Raise electrical system components.\n","7466:  Increase the height of electric service panels (fuse and circuit breaker boxes) and all outlets, switches, and wiring to at least 1 foot above the potential food elevation.\n","7467:  These modifcations should be made by a licensed electrician.\n","7468:  _ Protect utilities and service equipment.\n","7469:  Move the main parts of your heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems to a higher foor or the attic.\n","7470:  Consider raising other major appliances, such as washers, dryers, and hot water heaters, above the ground foor.\n","7471:  If relocation or elevation is not possible, you can protect service equipment in place using low foodwalls and shields.\n","7472:  Alternative options such as replacing traditional hot water heaters with tankless units should also be considered.\n","7473:  _ Anchor indoor fuel tanks.\n","7474:  Anchor fuel tanks by attaching them to a large concrete slab that weighs enough to resist the force of foodwaters.\n","7475:  _ Install a food alert system.\n","7476:  A variety of food sensors and other early warning devices can alert you to the risk of imminent fooding so that you can take preventative or protective actions before extensive damage occurs (see _Flood Preparedness_).\n","7478:  Contact your local community offcials.\n","7479:  Start with the local planning and zoning

1.1 Introduction and Application of this Document General This document provides guidelines for the design of sea dikes to protect low lying lands that are exposed to coastal flood hazards arising from their exposure to the sea and to expected sea level rise due to climate change.\n","7498:  Qualified professionals with specialist engineering or environmental expertise must be involved and retained to design specific project components and to facilitate agency approvals.\n","7502:  Analysis of flooding hazard from all sources _ rivers and the sea - will be required in

definitions as used in the existing documents; Dike Design and Construction Guide 20032 and Land Use Guidelines 20044 are used; however, as the existing terminology and definitions sometimes need modification, clarification or expansion to be appropriate for coastal conditions, in some cases new or revised terminology and definitions are proposed.\n","7517:  It should be noted that a Building Code or Standard does not exist in Canada for coastal engineering structures.\n","7520:  In these situations; theoretical analysis, evaluation of the approaches for application to the specifics of British Columbia coastal waters and recognized engineering practise should be used to select among alternative methods.\n","7524:  Actions from Wave and Currents on Coastal Structures.\n","7525:  ISO

British Standard Code of Practice for Maritime Structures.\n","7533:  Coastal Engineering Manual.\n","7537:  Wave Height Distributions on Shallow Foreshores.\n","7541:  A sea dike is not intended to protect the shoreline or the adjacent seabed against erosion, although this may become a secondary aspect of the sea dike design, or the sea dike may be incorporated into a larger project with erosion protection, shoreline restoration or marine habitat preservation as concurrent objectives.\n","7547:  The relationship between the bathymetric survey datum, the topographic survey datum and the tidal datum for the area shall also be defined over the project area5.\n","7554:  For the purpose of this document we use the term CGD to mean the datum as defined in 2010 and approximately equal to MSL.\n","7559:  Regional Sea Level Rise Global sea level rise expectations must be adjusted to account for regional variations and for crustal movements particular to the area under consideration.\n","7570:  Over a period of 100 years these rates will increase the expected sea level rise due to global SLR by 0.1 to 0.2 m. 3.2.4 Astronomical Tides Predictions of expected water levels due to astronomical tides are available throughout coastal British Columbia from the Canadian Hydrographic Service (CHS), Fisheries and Oceans Canada and are published annually under the authority of CHS.\n","7574:  The published data in Volumes 5 through 7 of the Canadian Tide and Current Tables for specific areas within each general region should be consulted as tidal ranges can vary by 1 m or more within each region.\n","7578:  Definition of the Designated Flood Level for the design of a sea dike will require definition of a combination of appropriate tidal water levels and meteorological related water levels.\n","7579:  Joint probability analysis methods are often used to define appropriate combinations of tide and storm surge that reflect the times of occurrence of the two processes; however, as tide is totally independent of storm occurrence and resulting storm surge, reasonable and valid estimates can be made by treating the statistics of each process as independent.\n","7583:  - Ranges based on MWL as published by CHS _ 0.0 m CGD parameters can vary up to _ 0.3 m along the coast parameters can vary up to _ 0.4 m along the strait parameters can vary up to _ 0.4 m over the strait parameters can vary up to _ 1.0 m along the coast parameters can vary up to _ 2.5 m along the coast Tofino Victoria Point Atkinson Bella Bella Prince Rupert 3.2.5 Meteorological Water Level Effects Sea levels along coastal British Columbia are also affected by meteorological and oceanographic conditions specific to the area that result in differences between the predictable astronomical tides (Section 3.2.4) and the actual water level at a given time.\n","7585:  _ Sea level change due to the effects of strong winds blowing over the water surface.\n","7586:  _ Sea level change due to wave momentum effects in shallow water _ Sea level change due to changes in ocean currents or temperature.\n","7587:  The integrated effect of these forcing mechanisms can be seen in measured water level data by removing the predicted astronomical tide, which then defines a residual water level that reflects all of the forcing mechanisms outlined above.\n","7588:  In coastal British Columbia waters, the characteristics of residual water levels can be defined with the assistance of the long term measured water level records available from several long term CHS tide recording stations along the coast.\n","7597:  Many sea dikes will be located inshore of the inter-tidal profile and may have extensive areas of shallow water or drying inter-tidal banks _ ie: Boundary Bay or Rev: 0 Date: 27 January 2011 Project No: 143111: BC Ministry of Environment /Climate Change Adaption Guidelines for Sea Dikes and Coastal Flood Hazard Land Use 9 the West Richmond sea dikes - offshore of the dike.\n","7598:  In these situations the effect of strong winds and waves may further increase the water level during storms and site specific analysis will be required.\n","7603:  Reference must be made to the specific requirements in the Reference Publications.\n","7604:  Local Wave Climate at the Dike As a preliminary guideline, the maximum seastate7 that can exist in a given depth of shallow water can be estimated using the procedures outlined in CIRIA; CUR; CETMEF (2007) or US Army Corps of Engineering (2002).\n","7607:  In general, an iterative procedure will be required during design to define the seastate.\n","7608:  It will also be necessary to check that the seastate at the toe of the dike is consistent with the Designated Storm for the annual exceedance probability specified for the sea dike planning or design process.\n","7609:  The details of the design seastate that are required for planning or design can be defined using the procedures outlined in EA, ENW, KFKI (2007) or specifically in Battjes, et al.\n","7610:  (2000).\n","7611:  3.2.7 Scour Waves and currents may cause scour to occur on the seabed adjacent to a sea dike.\n","7612:  The scour depth that may occur either during the design life of the sea dike or during the Designated Storm should be considered and either allowed for in defining the necessary sea dike crest elevation or scour protection should be provided as necessary.\n","7623:  These known uncertainties should be explicitly stated during design.\n","7625:  The Sea Dike Crest Elevation can be defined based on the following: Designated Flood Level + Wave Run-up + Freeboard or: Designated Flood Level + Acceptable Crest Height where: Wave Run-up = vertical distance above the mean water level exceeded, by no more than 2% of the waves at the toe of the sea dike Acceptable Crest Height = vertical distance above the mean water level required to keep any wave overtopping below the chosen criteria for acceptable rates of overtopping, as summarized below in Table 4-1 or Table 4-2.\n","7628:  The total quantity of overtopping during the Designated Storm should be defined to ensure that it is consistent with the FCL defined for inundation behind a Sea Dike.\n","7629:  Overtopping of a sea dike can take two main forms.\n","7630:  If wave runup is high enough, relative to the crest elevation of the dike, water can pass over the dike as a nearly continuous sheet or plume of water.\n","7636:  As initial guidance, the average or mean overtopping discharges summarized below in Table 4-1 and Table 4-2 can be used.\n","7638:  The criteria in Table 4-2 can be used to estimate the crest elevation required for a vertical seawall that starts at or near the high tide elevation.\n","7654:  Specification of a suitable Sea Dike Crest Elevation will generally be an iterative process as the volume of overtopping for a given Designated Storm will be significantly influenced by the design of the seaward face of the sea dike.\n","7655:  Acceptable quantities of overtopping may also be significantly influenced by the design of the landward face of the sea dike, especially if space or land use does not permit the 1:3 (V:H) landward slope implied by the criteria in Table 4-1.\n","7656:  Case specific engineering investigations will be warranted in many situations.\n","7658:  The design of the seaward face shall take into consideration any scour or erosion that may occur in front of the dike during the Designated Storm.\n","7662:  It should be noted that design guidance for the landward face of a sea dike that is exposed to overtopping is, in general, limited in scope.\n","7663:  Structure specific detailed engineering investigations will likely be required if the design is different from the 1:3 (V:H) landward slope implied by the criteria in Table 4-1 and Table 4-2.\n","7667:  Wave Height Distributions on Shallow Foreshores.\n","7672:

above the natural boundary of the water-body or above the natural ground elevation may be used (as defined in the Land Use Guidelines 2004).\n","7722:  1.9 Flood Plain A lowland area, whether diked, flood proofed, or not, which, by reasons of land elevation, is susceptible to flooding from an adjoining watercourse, ocean, lake or other body of water and for administration purposes is taken to be that area submerged at the Designated Flood Level.\n","7724:  Special measures may be warranted in this area.\n","7728:  In coastal areas exposed to flooding, construction of fill as a flood proofing measure may substantially increase the freeboard required to define the FCL, if the fill is directly exposed to the Designated Flood Level.\n","7730:  Used to establish the Flood Construction Level.\n","7741:  In the future the location and elevation of a Natural Boundary will change from time to time due to changes associated with sea level rise and it will likely lag sea level

population is located in coastal communities, including the capital of St. John_s which is home to just over a third of total population.50 Although, sea level rise has been documented throughout the province,51 most of the coastline of Newfoundland and Labrador is of moderate to low sensitivity to sea level change.\n","8177:  Adaptation strategies can be grouped into four broad categories:57 Protect is a reactive strategy to protect people, property and infrastructure from sea level rise and is typically the first response considered.\n","8180:  It may also compound risk by encouraging further development behind dikes and other structural protection elements, thereby increasing the number of people and amount of property at risk if these fail.\n","8182:  Communities may use a protect strategy as an interim measure, providing time to implement a retreat or avoid strategy; however the strategy should be recognized as a temporary solution and not used to encourage further development.\n","8183:  Other forms of protection can take place.\n","8185:  These measures can be implemented as sea levels rise, and may complement or supplement structural protection.\n","8186:  Such non-structural adaptations can enhance the natural resilience of the coastal zone and can be less expensive than structural protection, which can lead to unwanted effects on erosion and sedimentation patterns if not properly implemented.61 Accommodate is an adaptive strategy that allows continued occupation of coastal areas while changes are made to human activities and/or infrastructure to adapt to sea level rise.\n","8187:  Accommodation can also involve retrofitting a building or making it more resilient to the consequences of sea level rise.\n","8189:  Strategies such as covenants indemnifying governments from the consequences of coastal hazards may also be used to reduce local government liability.\n","8198:  (Adaptation _ Coastal Zone 2007) (Adaptation _ Coastal Zone 2007) (Adaptation _ Coastal Zone 2007) 59 60 61 21 Managed retreat is a strategy typically undertaken with a long-term perspective.\n","8199:  Small scale managed retreat may include site-specific relocation within a property or relocation to another site.\n","8200:  Large scale relocation may include an entire community.\n","8203:  The strategy may also be used to provide space for coastal ecosystems to expand or reclaim areas as the sea level rises.62 Managed retreat is not currently used as frequently as other strategies.\n","8208:  Avoid involves planning so that development does not take place in areas subject to coastal hazards associated with sea level rise or where the risk is low at present but will increase over time.\n","8209:  This may involve identifying future _no build_ areas within local government planning documents.\n","8210:  A wide range of planning tools may be involved in coming to a decision to avoid development in areas subject to moderate to high risk.\n","8211:  Regulatory tools may include the designation or zoning of lands for limited development or nonhabitable uses.\n","8212:  An avoid strategy may include land acquisition or restriction tools such as a land trust, or the transfer of development potential to areas with low or no risk due to sea level rise.\n","8222:  In the Dutch case, the current use of ocean sediment dredged from one location to another represents a form of soft armouring to protect vulnerable areas behind dikes.\n","8227:  Instances of land reclamation in Canada take the form of soft armouring or hard protection implemented as part of a protect strategy.63 (Abel, et al.\n","8231:  This process may involve building internal capacity, identifying champions and establishing a cross-departmental steering committee to address sea level rise.\n","8233:  The inclusion of community input at this early stage can help foster a sense of ownership and provide valuable information that may otherwise be overlooked.\n","8235:  Establishing community priorities and a preferred strategic direction will help narrow down the choice of adaptation tools that may be applicable in individual communities.\n","8236:  Many of the adaptation tools identified in this Primer will require ongoing public input and support to be successfully implemented.\n","8243:  Such information can be converted and used to spatially depict _coastal hazard zones_ or _sea level rise planning areas_ (see Figure 6 _ Sketch of Coastal Hazard Mapping Components).\n","8244:  Mapping environmental constraints and opportunities can demonstrate land sensitivity, including: lands vulnerable to sea level rise; increases in tidal surges; changes in low and high tides; increases in coastal and riparian flooding; changes in high and low water tables; and impacts on aquatic and terrestrial habitats.\n","8246:  Relevant topics may include the following: _ How will the environment

analysis of a variety of adaptation tools and their applicability in communities on Canada_s southern coasts.\n","8308:  This grouping can be further broken down into on-site and off-site works, which are also referred to as property-specific and linear shoreline protection measures.\n","8315:  Risk Management _ Measurement of the likelihood and consequences of risks to property, buildings and

plans, and growth management strategies.\n","8340:  Application Objectives and policies may be used as an adaptation tool in every coastal community in Canada.\n","8341:  They may also be added to existing policy frameworks such as Official Community Plans or Regional Development Strategies.\n","8342:  Setting objectives and policies often enables implementation of other tools.\n","8343:  Implementation may be achieved through the use of regulatory tools such as a zoning bylaw or development permit.\n","8344:  Land acquisition, land trust, structural protection and soft armouring all represent means of implementing objectives and policies and other planning tools.\n","8345:  Enabling Legislation The Local Government Act in B.C.\n","8346:  requires all Official Community Plans (OCPs) to identify restrictions on the use of land that is subject to hazardous conditions (e.g.\n","8348:  An OCP must include the approximate location and phasing of roads, sewers and water systems.\n","8349:  This may identify infrastructure at risk and enable adaptations.\n","8378:  Economic obligations associated with development in hazardous areas may increase (e.g., development in areas at risk of coastal hazards with no protection measures).\n","8380:  Incorporating adaptation to sea level rise into these objectives and policies is a logical next step.\n","8388:  Advantages Disadvantages Research and policy development in adapting to sea level rise may be time consuming and require a commitment of staff and financial resources.\n","8389:  The addition of policies to address sea level rise may add controversy, particularly _Avoid_ or _ Retreat_ strategies.\n","8392:  The degree to which objectives are met and policies implemented can be measured and monitored over time.\n","8396:  Projected future sea levels can then be superimposed on a topographic map of coastal hazards to identify new areas subject to hazards.\n","8405:  The set of elevation points generated by a LiDAR survey can be brought into a geographical information system (GIS) and used to build surfaces that represent the earth_s topography with great precision.\n","8406:  This provides an ideal base map which can be used to determine coastal hazard risk.73 Ground surveys provide the highest accuracy; however, to cover an entire coastline using this method may be impractical and prohibitively expensive.\n","8407:  Ground surveys may be used to supplement or monitor the accuracy of the results received from LiDAR or other technologies.\n","8409:  Floodplain map topography should not be relied upon to establish specific building elevations.74 An engineering analysis is then used to map areas at risk.\n","8416:  This lack of sea ice must also be documented as a coastal hazard.\n","8421:  Coastal hazard mapping complements and strengthens other adaptation options and increases stakeholder awareness of areas at risk.\n","8447:  Environmental _ Coastal hazard mapping may incorporate environmental data such as coastal habitats at risk or sensitive ecosystems and enable better environmental protection for areas at risk.\n","8454:  In order for coastal hazard maps to effectively reduce future coastal hazard risk and facilitate sustainable development, the consideration of hazard maps must be integrated into planning procedures and periodically updated.\n","8455:  The required expertise and modelling capacity may not be locally available, especially in smaller local governments.\n","8457:  To pool limited resources and address trans-boundary impacts, work at a regional scale _ with support from various levels of government _ is often the most effective approach to hazard mapping.\n","8469:  Risk Management In itself, new coastal hazard mapping will not cause a reduction in risk nor address sea level rise.\n","8470:  The information must be integrated into other regulatory, land use change, and structural and non-structural tools before the full benefits can be realised.\n","8471:  To realise the full benefits of coastal hazard mapping, it is important to provide people in the areas at risk with information about emergency procedures and ways of reducing risk.\n","8473:  The collection of topographic and bathymetric data to complement extreme water level and wave height information could be expensive.\n","8480:  The second involves selecting and implementing management measures.\n","8482:  Coastal hazards due to sea level rise may include the risk of a major disaster such as a dike failure as well as risks from gradual changes such as increasing salinization of groundwater.\n","8483:  A risk assessment may have aspects that affect people, the environment and the economy.\n","8489:  With sea level rise, increased protection measures will be required just to maintain the same level of protection (i.e., 1:100 years or 1:200 years) that has been historically provided.\n","8491:  Should a higher level of protection be called for, additional measures will be required.\n","8492:  Whether the standard of protection remains the same or is increased, other approaches to risk management may be required.\n","8494:  Enabling Legislation A risk assessment does not require specific enabling legislation.\n","8496:  Risk management may also be undertaken as part of an emergency planning and preparedness initiative.\n","8499:  It can also include an analysis of the cost of _doing nothing._ A cost- benefit analysis _ used to determine how well, or how poorly, a planned action will turn out _ can assist the risk management process.\n","8503:  (Can it be justified?\n","8506:  This involves comparing the total expected cost of each option against the total expected benefits, to see if the benefits outweigh the costs, and by how much.\n","8508:  Environmental _ Risk management may be used to reduce sea level rise risks to environmental assets and species at risk.\n","8517:  Risk management may involve a rigorous, defensible analytic approach with reliable information used to support decision making.\n","8521:  The absence of detailed studies may impede some initiatives but should not prevent the use of interim measures to reduce risk (e.g.\n","8522:  minimum setback and elevation from the natural boundary or other potential risk).\n","8525:  Coastal flooding may result in property damage, damage to or destruction of property contents, economic losses due to severed transportation links and other damaged infrastructure.\n","8529:  Application Emergency planning and preparedness measures may be undertaken in all coastal areas at risk of coastal hazards, irrespective of the other adaptation tools implemented.\n","8539:  In 1999, to assist local and diking authorities to prepare a flood response plan, the B.C.\n","8543:  39 Planning Tools Emergency Management B.C.\n","8544:  stresses the importance of volunteers in dealing with emergencies of various types, including floods.\n","8549:  Their municipal emergency management guide outlines key components and steps to help communities to develop plans, create exercises and ensure resources have been identified before an emergency occurs.\n","8551:  Emergency planning templates are available for municipalities and local businesses to create an emergency plan specific to the community or business requirements and emergency training is offered to individuals and organizations that have a role to play in an emergency.\n","8553:  Input in the form of assistance _ technical and monetary _ for the preparation of emergency plans or planning may come from higher government departments, agencies, and NGOs.81 Environmental _ This tool is not intended to address environmental issues.\n","8554:  Social _ The primary objective of this tool is the protection of human life, followed by the maintenance of essential services and the protection of infrastructure and buildings.\n","8555:  This tool lays the groundwork to prepare for a possible emergency and undertake planning measures including the evacuation of an area to protect human life.\n","8560:  The plans must be updated regularly to remain current.\n","8568:  Regulation of Land Use Tool Description Land use can be regulated through neighbourhood plans, character guidelines, capital works plans, strategic plans, growth management plans and setback regulations.\n","8569:  Land use can also be regulated through the establishment of appropriate zoning within areas subject to or potentially subject to coastal hazards.\n","8570:  Zoning can regulate a wide range of activities, including restrictions on land uses, land use densities, setbacks, siting circumstances and servicing standards.\n","8571:  Application Land use regulation _ especially zoning _ is a tool available in all provinces, although the specific scope of regulation ranges from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.\n","8573:  This tool can also be used to create new composite zones, such as a Sea Level Rise Planning Areas.\n","8574:  Enabling Legislation In B.C., under Section 903 of the Local Government Act, a local government may by bylaw divide the whole or part of the municipality or regional district into zones, name each zone, establish their boundaries and regulate the use of land, siting and density of buildings and other structures within each one.\n","8575:  This legislation could be used to create new zones with respect to coastal areas and enable a local government to regulate the use of land.\n","8576:  In B.C., provincial guidelines82 call for new construction containing habitable space to be located above the historical 1 in 200 year flood event plus an additional safety margin (called freeboard) to deal with uncertainty.\n","8603:  (Province of Nova Scotia 2009) (Province of Nova Scotia 2009) 84 85 42 Regulatory Tools In Newfoundland and Labrador, responsibility for land use planning is shared by the provincial, federal, municipal, Innu Nation and Nunatsiavut governments.\n","8608:  All individuals applying for unencumbered Crown land in Newfoundland and Labrador must maintain a 15 metre buffer zone between the shoreline and the boundary of the issued title though there is a reduction to 10 metres for residential lots and some older land grants are exempt.\n","8609:  As in other provincial jurisdictions, municipalities and regional planning authorities can implement measures under their own plans and bylaws to protect coastal areas from sea level rise, flooding, erosion or other hazards.\n","8612:  While these restrictions have significant economic implications, they may be introduced in the public interest, for example, to meet changing community needs and manage competing interests and conflict.\n","8613:  Environmental _ Regulation may facilitate identification and protection of environmentally sensitive areas and manage environmental hazards.\n","8619:  Public acceptance may also pose a challenge.\n","8625:  87 See draft Humber Valley Regional Land Use Plan 2011-12.\n","8629:  Local government may not be able to impose zoning that will render the land sterile (i.e., unable to be used) but it can restrict the way in which land and buildings are used so that risks can be addressed.\n","8630:  Technical supporting documentation to address coastal flood risks may be expensive (e.g., floodplain mapping, design briefs, updated flood risk assessment, implementation measures to adapt to or reduce flood risk).\n","8631:  Interim measures may lack technical documentation but can be undertaken at modest cost (e.g.\n","8632:  sea level rise study area).\n","8633:  Subdivision Regulation Tool Description Subdivision regulation can be used to prevent or establish conditions for the subdivision of land at risk from coastal hazards associated with sea level rise.\n","8634:  A proposed subdivision must go through a review process, which culminates in the approval (including approval with conditions) or refusal of the proposed subdivision by the Approving Officer or other appointed official.\n","8636:  This can include a simple property, bare land strata lot, or strata unit (e.g., townhouse, row house, or condominium unit in an apartment building).\n","8645:  A subdivision can also be refused if the cost to government of providing public utilities or other works and services would be excessive or if the subdivision would adversely affect the natural environment.\n","8656:  all have similar environmental provisions in place.\n","8661:  Subdivision regulation can be used to address environmental issues such as suitability of land use and development impact.\n","8662:  Social _ Various public stakeholders and potential land owners may be affected by the approval or refusal to approve a subdivision.\n","8663:  An Official Community Plan or a similar guiding document may provide a framework for these decisions and provide guidance on the suitability of subdivision development; particularly for residential use.\n","8664:  Implementation Measures and Challenges This tool relies heavily on accurate information and coastal hazard mapping to provide grounds for the approval or refusal of a subdivision.\n","8672:  The loss of potential development value could result in resistance from developers.\n","8673:  Reducing subdivision of coastal land should not be undertaken ad hoc or without supporting guiding policy or a strategy in place.\n","8678:  Development Permit Tool Description A Development Permit is a form of land use regulation distinctive to B.C.\n","8680:  A Development Permit can regulate development for a variety of purposes, two of which are applicable to sea level rise: _ protection of the natural environment, its ecosystems and biological diversity; and _ protection of development from hazardous conditions.\n","8685:  The objectives of the Development Permit must be established and guidance given for addressing the objectives.\n","8689:  Enabling Legislation In B.C., a local government can establish Development Permit Areas under Section 919.1 of the Local Government Act.\n","8690:  A DPA and guidelines can be included in an Official Community Plan or a zoning bylaw.\n","8691:  Where a DPA has been designated by bylaw, no subdivision, building construction or alteration, or alteration of land can proceed unless a Development Permit has first been issued by the local government.\n","8692:  In order to address the hazardous conditions specified in the DPA, the local government may require that the applicant provide a report certified by a professional engineer.\n","8694:  If an OCP designates areas as requiring a Development Permit, this must be issued prior to the subdivision of land within the area and the construction of, addition to or alteration of a building or other structure.\n","8696:  The cost of the independent professional and the cost of meeting the Development Permit conditions can also be considerable.\n","8700:  Social _ The establishment of a Development Permit Area in an OCP or zoning bylaw requires a public hearing.\n","8705:  Advantages Disadvantages Hazardous areas must be documented and identified prior to their designation.\n","8710:  A Development Permit cannot be turned down by the local government if the specified objectives and guidelines are met.\n","8713:  A DPA can be included in an Official Community Plan with a narrative describing the objectives that justify the designation and specifying the guidelines for addressing the objectives, accompanied by a map.\n","8720:  Building Regulation Tool Description Local communities have a tools which can be used to influence the manner in which buildings are situated and constructed.\n","8726:  The National Building Code does not have specific design requirements to protect buildings from coastal hazards but does ensure that buildings are constructed to certain safety and design standards.\n","8727:  47 Regulatory Tools Although not all local governments in British Columbia have chosen to enforce the provincial code, technically, the code applies throughout the province.\n","8735:  Under section 56 of this Act, a municipal building inspector may withhold the issuance of a building permit until satisfied the land can be safely used and can require a geotechnical report by a qualified professional if construction is proposed on land likely to be subject to hazards such as flooding or erosion.\n","8736:  A building permit can be refused until the owner agrees to a covenant on the property title stating that the land will only be used in the manner certified in the report.\n","8754:  In some cases a project may have to be abandoned if a qualified professional cannot certify that a building can be safely constructed for the intended use or that the cost for doing so would be excessive.\n","8757:  Other planning tools that typically occur at an earlier stage in the development process should be used to address environmental criteria (e.g., growth management policies, easement, land purchase, subdivision, and zoning).\n","8758:  Social _ This tool is designed to address public safety.\n","8760:  If a building cannot safely be constructed in a particular location or if the cost of doing so is economically prohibitive then it will not be constructed, thus reducing the risk to people and property.\n","8761:  The use of this tool gives priority to the protection of the public.\n","8762:  Implementation Measures and Challenges In B.C.\n","8763:  the Community Charter and Local Government Act authorizes the local government building inspectors to withhold the issuance of a Building Permit unless a qualified professional can provide a report certifying the land can be used safely for the intended purpose.\n","8766:  In some smaller communities, local government has chosen not to undertake a building inspection function and so in these areas, this tool cannot be used.\n","8774:  Local governments may not have the technical resources to give guidance in determining the minimum elevation for safe building construction (i.e., Flood Construction Level).\n","8776:  Reliance on a qualified professional introduces the risk of retaining a person who lacks the necessary skills.\n","8778:  Where building regulation or enforcement has not been adopted as a local government function, this tool will not be available.\n","8780:  Land Acquisition Tool Description Local governments can gain ownership of land for the primary purpose of addressing public safety through purchase or expropriation.\n","8781:  Land can be acquired for a variety of purposes, including structural protection works (i.e., a dike or other hard protection), vehicular access or setbacks for public safety.\n","8782:  Land can also be acquired to prevent the development or to hold it in public ownership for exclusive public use.\n","8783:  Application Land can be acquired to accommodate a new dike, for the landward expansion of an existing dike or as the land base needed for other forms of structural protection.\n","8784:  Land acquisition can be used to provide public open space, protect rare or endangered habitat or create an ecological reserve.\n","8785:  It can also be used to avoid the cost of servicing land at risk due to sea level rise.\n","8786:  Land purchase may take place to prevent the development of land subject to hazards, however if land is required for a public purpose, government cannot simply downzone land for exclusive public use without compensating the owner.\n","8788:  Expropriation may also be referred to as a compulsory acquisition, compulsory purchase or eminent domain.\n","8794:  Land acquisition may also be used to provide for public open space purposes subject to restrictions on improvements and the timing and extent of activities.\n","8795:  Social _ There are social considerations and impacts associated with the acquisition of private land to protect the public interest.\n","8797:  dike or seawall).\n","8798:  Social benefits may include the acquisition of public open space and public access along a dike.\n","8802:  Strategic or Official Community Plans may identify properties needed for future land acquisition and, if so, make provisions for funding these acquisitions.\n","8808:  Land purchase may be used in combination with other tools to reduce the cost of flood protection (e.g., dike vs. seawall).\n","8809:  This will require a comparative analysis of options that includes the cost of land and structural tools.\n","8822:  The tool can direct development away from the area at risk by designating the _donor_ or _sending_ area and allocating it to an appropriate _receiving_ area where development or increased density can be safely accommodated.\n","8825:  Density transfer could apply to any land use but is typically applied to residential uses.\n","8827:  An Official Community Plan or other similar policy document is needed to determine both areas at risk and areas where additional density is deemed suitable.\n","8829:  Density transfer relies on an administrative process to regulate exchanges and a market to determine value.\n","8830:  Density transfer could be applied in any municipality and would be best used in conjunction with a strategic plan where managed retreat is an objective.\n","8831:  Enabling Legislation The transfer of development potential can occur within the normal powers of zoning.\n","8838:  Social _ The primary use of this tool would be to reduce the development or redevelopment potential of land in areas at risk due to sea level rise.\n","8844:  This tool is market-based and could be structured so local government requirements are limited to administrative costs.\n","8845:  Transfer of density potential could be combined with land acquisition in which the local government acquires ownership of the land and transfers the development potential to the former owner elsewhere in the same municipality.\n","8846:  Density transfer may provide a less costly alternative to land acquisition (whether voluntary or through expropriation).\n","8850:  As a voluntary undertaking, the transfer of development potential may not prevent the development of areas at risk from coastal hazards.\n","8853:  It can be used to allow access over, use of or other limitation that benefits one piece of land (known as the dominant tenement) and burdens another (known as the servient tenement) without resulting in a change of ownership.\n","8860:  Restrictive or negative requirements would include a limitation on development for flood protection purposes or prevention of the use of fill.\n","8886:  Under this Act, a private landowner may impose a restrictive covenant on his or her land by entering into an agreement with a covenant holder.\n","8887:  Such a restrictive covenant may be positive or negative in nature and prohibit specific uses of the land.\n","8893:  A Save Harmless provision in a covenant can be used to protect a local government from financial damages in the event of future flooding.\n","8894:  The cost of an easement or statutory right-of-way will vary depending on the applicable conditions _ an appraisal is frequently used to determine fair market value.\n","8896:  A local government may be able to issue a tax receipt for a conservation easement if it is classified as a charitable gift by the Canada Revenue Agency.\n","8898:  Part or all of the land may be restricted for habitat conservation and a covenant may also be used as means of requiring an undertaking for environment enhancement purposes.\n","8903:  Challenges may include securing an agreement with the land owner as to the nature, value and funding of the restriction.\n","8904:  Advantages Disadvantages Annual compensation or a lump sum payment may be required to secure the easement or statutory right of way process or servitude.\n","8905:  The easement or other restriction can be limited to a particular part of a site, a particular purpose or a specific time period.\n","8908:  A covenant may be used in conjunction with other tools such as subdivision, building or land use regulation.\n","8909:  A conservation easement may be considered a charitable gift by the Canada Revenue Agency.\n","8910:  A covenant may be negotiated as part of the development approval process with no direct cost to the local government.\n","8911:  Land Trusts Tool Description A land trust is a non-profit private organization created for the purpose of environmental conservation or other similar purpose.\n","8917:  Land trusts may work in a variety of ways to address their individual mandates; these can include accepting gifts of land from private donors, undertaking fundraising to acquire land to prevent the loss of environmentally significant values, and managing land in public ownership to protect and enhance its habitat and other environmental characteristics.\n","8919:  While this does not specifically refer to adaptation to sea level rise, the conservation objectives of existing land trusts can easily accommodate this aspect, particularly with habitat creation or enhancements such as coastal wetland and sand dune creation, or rehabilitation.\n","8920:  Englishman River Estuary on Vancouver Island, B.C.\n","8924:  Local government could facilitate involvement of a land trust without necessarily expending financial resources and achieve the objective of protecting people from coastal hazards.\n","8926:  Social _ This tool can either restrict or enhance public access to environmentally sensitive land or habitat rehabilitation areas.\n","8928:  Implementation Measures and Challenges The implementation of this tool can include acquiring land by a land trust through fundraising, eco-gift, or government transfer, preparing a conservation agreement, and undertaking the necessary restoration and maintenance of the land once an easement, covenant or other restriction is in place.\n","8936:  Fundraising for privately managed land acquisition by a land trust offers opportunities that may not be available if government is involved.\n","8937:  Local governments can work collaboratively with land trusts to identify areas that may be suited to environmental protection and play a facilitation role but leave the negotiation with the land owner up to the trust.\n","8938:  Foreshore Tenure Tool Description A foreshore tenure is a legal instrument that authorizes a use or uses over intertidal and subtidal areas.\n","8939:  This may include a lease or

a more comprehensive approach to shoreline management.\n","8943:  Application A foreshore tenure could be applied to almost all of Canada_s southern coasts.\n","8945:  Foreshore tenure does not affect the underlying Crown ownership of land (including land under water) but it can be used by a local government as part of a comprehensive approach to shoreline management such as beach nourishment, sand dune or coastal wetland creation and/or rehabilitation as well as hard structural protection.\n","8950:  A licence of occupation may be used if the term is short, where minimal improvements are proposed or for remote sites where survey costs may be prohibitive.\n","8951:  A statutory right of way may also be used to accommodate a linear corridor within a foreshore area.\n","8953:  The interests of riparian owners and First Nations must usually be considered and the lease must be consistent with zoning by local government or other applicable authorities.\n","8972:  Enabling Legislation In B.C.\n","8983:  58 Land Use Change or Restriction Tools West Vancouver, B.C.\n","8984:  Seawall Evaluation and Governance Considerations Economic _ In B.C., the cost of a foreshore lease is set by the Province.\n","8985:  The assessed or market value of a lease may be set at a percentage of the land value, for example 8% annually.\n","8989:  This can facilitate implementation of innovative soft armoring approaches such as habitat enhancement of intertidal areas, beach nourishment or the creation of wetlands.\n","8991:  Social _ Local governance tenure over the foreshore can allow for partnerships with riparian owners and local community groups to provide protection for upland areas or intertidal habitats.\n","8993:  Increased recreational use may provide an additional indirect benefit.\n","8995:  One challenge will be to refocus this tool as part of a sea level rise adaptation strategy.\n","9000:  59 Land Use Change or Restriction Tools Advantages Disadvantages Foreshore tenure could enable a local government to undertake a broader range of shoreline management and adaptation measures in response to coastal hazards.\n","9001:  A foreshore lease (or other form of tenure) could enable environmental enhancement to occur with less reliance on structural protection.\n","9005:  The applicability of this tool will be limited to areas with suitable shoreline conditions and bathymetry.\n","9016:  The surface may include a gravel topping or filter fabric as well as topsoil for landscaping.\n","9017:  Other scour protection may take the form of pile foundations designed to derive vertical and lateral support below the depth of scour.\n","9019:  A scour apron may be used to support retaining walls of linear infrastructure (e.g.\n","9020:  dikes) to ensure the toe of the structure is protected.\n","9023:  Environmental impacts will be limited for buildings, but may increase in magnitude where scour protection is introduced along a linear corridor such a seawall, stormwater outfall or a pipeline crossing.\n","9025:  Social _ This tool is intended to minimize risk to the foundations of buildings and structures.\n","9030:  The tool may be implemented in conjunction with other requirements as determined by a building inspector, approving officer or the terms set within a covenant on title.\n","9034:  Advantages Disadvantages Provide a barrier to protect the foundation of a building or other structure from wave action or other form of rapidly moving water.\n","9044:  The increase in elevation above the natural ground level can be determined through a risk assessment by a qualified professional or in accordance with local government requirements, guidelines or policy.\n","9046:  In urban areas where lot areas are smaller, this tool may involve creating non-habitable space (crawl space or cellar) in areas subject to flooding.\n","9047:  A combination of fill and building design changes may be used for new development on a neighbourhood level or for infill redevelopment within an existing area.\n","9049:  If a local government considers that flooding may occur on a piece of land, the local government may adopt a bylaw requiring a minimum elevation for the underside of a floor system of a house on that land.\n","9050:  Such a bylaw must consider the provincial guidelines, which take sea level rise and related impacts into account.\n","9059:  Flood construction requirements in Atlantic Canada may reference a minimum elevation above sea level datum, geodetic datum or protection for a 1 in 100 year return period or a 50 year design standard.\n","9064:  The affected site area will include the building footprint area plus a sloped area for the fill, typically at a 3:1 slope, to return to the natural ground level.\n","9065:  Alternatively, a retaining wall or other structure could be used to reduce or eliminate the sloped area.\n","9066:  The amount of fill could be substantial.\n","9071:  Electrical outlets would have to be raised and a furnace located above the Flood Construction Level.\n","9074:  The cost of floodproofing can also be compared to the cost of development in an area

inundation.\n","9079:  63 Structural Tools (Flood Protection Works) Social _ This tool primarily minimises risk to building inhabitants and structures themselves.\n","9084:  Structural elevation measures can be implemented after a building is constructed but incur greater costs.\n","9086:  A large structural elevation rise on a small property may not be feasible.\n","9088:  Providing access for persons with disabilities poses an additional challenge.\n","9093:  Although architectural design can address visual impact to some extent, a major change in elevation for a dwelling or other habitable structure serves as a vivid and constant public reminder that flooding is a risk that must be addressed.\n","9095:  The cost associated with raising the elevation of a building can be considerable.\n","9101:  The placement of fill to raise the ground level may not be aesthetically attractive if the elevation change is large.\n","9103:  Dikes Tool Description A dike is commonly a linear compacted earthfill structure intended to protect a designated area from inundation caused by high water conditions on an adjacent watercourse or floodplain.94 Dikes typically form the key defense element in a protect strategy.\n","9105:  Sea dikes typically have a flatter gradient on the seaward side, for the purpose of dissipating wave energy.\n","9107:  In addition, a sea dike will typically have toe scour protection consisting of riprap and an under layer of filter rock or geotextile to prevent it from being undermined.\n","9117:  Assets protected by dikes can include infrastructure and agricultural lands.\n","9134:  once in 10 years).\n","9135:  This would potentially flood over 20% of Sackville during a storm surge.\n","9137:  Where an increased dike height is involved, the economic, social and environmental implications of a seaward versus a landward expansion must be examined.\n","9139:  The standard for flood protection measures (i.e., Flood Construction Level for current sea level vs. projections for 2050 or 2100) will have a critical impact on the economic costs.\n","9141:  The capital and operating costs of dikes may limit their implementation to selected locations, such as densely populated areas, areas with high natural or cultural importance, and high value infrastructure.\n","9143:  Intermittent funding programs may not be appropriate where the need for upgrades is ongoing and long-term.\n","9144:  It may be difficult to obtain public acceptance depending on the capital costs and the distribution of those costs, especially if property views are impacted.\n","9146:  (Liekse and Bornemann 2012) 98 66 Structural Tools (Flood Protection Works) Sea dike upgrade costing study, Metro Vancouver, British Columbia99 In 2011 the Province of British Columbia published a Climate Change Adaptation Guidelines for Sea Dikes and Coastal Flood Hazard Land Use (Ausenco Sandwell, 2011), which defined sea level rise planning levels and flood protection requirements.\n","9148:  To gain a greater understanding of what implications the new guidelines would have on the ground, the B.C.\n","9151:  Within this area both diked shorelines and low-lying areas that may require protection as sea level rises were considered.\n","9163:  Implementation Measures and Challenges Apart from the high costs for construction, dike implementation measures require land acquisition for the linear corridor occupied by the dike as well as access for maintenance and emergency measures.\n","9164:  The linear corridor may affect numerous landowners and may require the relocation or removal of other structures.\n","9167:  Dikes can provide protection for high value development and maintain or enhance property values.\n","9170:  The dike crest may be available for use as a recreation corridor.\n","9172:  They may restrict access to the shore and reduce the recreational value of a shoreline.\n","9173:  Dikes may cause erosion to adjacent unprotected areas.\n","9175:  Dikes can result in a loss of intertidal areas and impede natural shoreline migration.\n","9176:  Tool Description There are several types of other hard protection structures commonly used within a coastal context.\n","9182:  A perched beach retained by a submerged structure may be considered a subset of this category.\n","9183:  Offshore breakwaters may also be called bulkheads.\n","9188:  Sea dike and upgraded Oliver Pump Station, Corporation of Delta, B.C.\n","9190:  They can be concrete, timber, armour rock (riprap), gabions and other materials.\n","9211:  Groynes, breakwaters and storm surge barriers may cause negative environmental impacts and transfer risk onto nearby properties.\n","9225:  Hard structural protection can provide protection for high value development or natural areas and maintain or increase property values.\n","9226:  A seawall may be available for use as a recreation corridor.\n","9228:  Structural measures to protect against erosion in one place can increase erosion elsewhere.\n","9229:  This situation may occur where incoming waves approach the shoreline at an angle causing sediment to move along the shoreline until blocked by a groyne.\n","9232:  Seawalls and other hard protection structures are expensive to construct and maintain, can be unsightly and restrict shore access.\n","9237:  It may be used for existing developments with small land parcels built where infrastructure is slightly below the established Flood Construction Level.\n","9243:  Adequately sized openings must be provided to equalize hydrostatic pressure.\n","9244:  Owners must be willing to experience a temporary loss of use of areas subject to flooding and must ensure damageable goods are not located in areas subject to flooding.\n","9246:  Social _ Wet flood proofing may reduce the risk of flooding to people and buildings.\n","9251:  Advantages Disadvantages Can reduce the time and cost of cleanup after a flood.\n","9252:  Wet floodproofing can be less costly than other retrofits as no additional land is required and the appearance of the building is minimally affected.\n","9253:  Allowing water to enter and exit a building may be a cost-effective alternative to dry floodproofing.\n","9254:  A wide range of water resistant materials can be used at a reasonable cost.\n","9258:  Goods may be damaged by floodwaters if they cannot be moved to higher ground.\n","9265:  Application On the seaward side, this tool can be used as part of a protect or accommodate strategy.\n","9269:  Wetland creation may be facilitated through Environment Canada_s Ecological Gifts Program.\n","9274:  Environment Canada_s Ecological Gifts Program, through which a landowner donates ecological sensitive land and receives a tax benefit, may be of assistance, although this program does not apply to existing intertidal areas, which are owned by the Crown throughout Canada.\n","9277:  Social _ Passive recreational activities, such as bird watching and interpretive opportunities, may complement the creation of coastal wetlands.\n","9280:  Implementation Measures and Challenges Like any tool, the appropriateness of wetland or salt marsh restoration must be evaluated on a site-by-site basis.\n","9281:  Understanding the biophysical conditions under which restoration is being considered is particularly important as these may ultimately determine the long-term sustainability of a restored wetland or marsh.104 Implementation measures include land acquisition, foreshore lease, covenant or other form of protection.\n","9282:  An assessment of the area by a Registered Professional Biologist or other qualified professional should take place.\n","9290:  Wetlands can provide highly productive new habitat and environmental benefits.\n","9293:  Dune Building or Rehabilitation Tool Description Naturally occurring dunes are wind-formed sand deposits representing a store of sediment in the zone just landward of normal high tides.\n","9299:  Both natural and artificial dunes can be stabilized through vegetation planting; vegetation roots help stabilize the dune.\n","9307:  Vegetative planting or fences may be used to stabilize an artificial dune.\n","9314:  Loss of views and direct access to coastal areas may affect existing residents.\n","9316:  Implementation could serve as a community education process about non-structural measures used in adapting to sea level rise.\n","9317:  Creating dunes on the ocean side may not be feasible.\n","9324:  Adopted in 2005, dated in 2010.\n","9326:  Dune protection can meet multiple objectives, including environmental enhancement and protection, public and recreational access, and hazard reduction.\n","9327:  Dunes can be created in a sensitive manner by taking into account the environment in which they are placed.\n","9328:  Dunes and the vegetation of dunes can provide an important environmental benefit by creating or increasing valuable coastal habitat for species at risk.\n","9329:  Dunes, especially artificial dunes, can be perceived as a barrier to beach access, and a dune creation proposal may run into community opposition.\n","9330:  While providing protection from erosion, dunes may conflict with residential or tourism purposes where the concern is maintaining _sea views_.\n","9331:  Dune development may be seen as an opportunity to encourage additional coastal development at risk from sea level rise.\n","9335:  As well, the bathymetry near the shoreline may not be suitable for the use of this tool.\n","9336:  Dunes may require a large footprint, which may have significant cost implications.\n","9337:  Beach Nourishment Tool Description Beach nourishment refers to the addition of sand or other similar beach sediment material to satisfy the erosional forces of natural wave action and prevent shoreline erosion.\n","9340:  The cross-sectional shape of a beach affects its ability to dissipate wave energy: a wide and shallow beach will attenuate wave energy more effectively than a steep and narrow beach.\n","9343:  Beach nourishment will likely be required on an ongoing basis as long as the forces of erosion are present.108 Application Beach nourishment can use sediment material dredged from the ocean, or material barged, trucked, moved by heavy equipment or by a conveyor belt from a land-based source.\n","9345:  If the available beach material drops below to a critical level, re-nourishment will be required to avoid further erosion and damage to coastal infrastructure.\n","9350:  The allocation of costs between individual benefiting property owners and the community as a whole may need to be addressed.\n","9351:  Beach nourishment may offer economic benefits as an alternative to or in combination with other forms of structural protection.\n","9352:  Environmental _ Beach nourishment may enhance intertidal areas.\n","9353:  However, negative effects could occur if the material deposited does not match the size and composition of native beach material, if the deposited material provides excessive turbidity or if the depth of material deposited buries existing marine organisms.\n","9357:  Ongoing monitoring will be required to evaluate the success of the beach nourishment and when additional beach nourishment is required.\n","9360:  This tool may provide an alternative to the use of hard protection such as groynes which can disrupt natural processes of sediment supply to a beach.\n","9361:  Beach nourishment can enhance the value of beaches by providing a more aesthetically appealing environment.\n","9363:  Beach nourishment may address multiple objectives, including environmental enhancement and protection, public and recreational access, and hazard reduction.\n","9365:  Beach nourishment can become prohibitively expensive if a supply of sediment is not readily available.\n","9368:  It will require regular monitoring and periodic re-nourishment depending on the rate of erosion that takes place.\n","9369:  Beach nourishment may affect the productivity of intertidal areas.\n","9377:  after a major storm surge in December, 2004.\n","9384:  A protect strategy may be suitable for an historic area where all buildings and infrastructure would be frequently inundated without the installation of linear structural protection such as a dike.\n","9385:  An accommodate strategy may apply to a new development at the margins of an area at risk of coastal flooding.\n","9386:  An avoid strategy may be applied to prevent a proposed new residential development or a large commercial or institutional development in a previously undeveloped area at risk of flooding.\n","9406:  now employ living shorelines approaches.\n","9417:  While this approach can discourage asset investment within high-risk hazard areas, it also puts pressure on local, provincial and federal government to provide _protection_ against the hazard.\n","9421:  Mutuality _ a large number of people must combine to form a risk pool or community.\n","9423:  Ability to be assessed _ the peril must be measurable and quantified in terms of possible losses of economic value.\n","9424:  Randomness _ the risk must be independent of the will of the insured and the event must not be predictable, except in a general way.\n","9431:  Property owners most exposed to a flood risk will be motivated to purchase flood insurance.\n","9432:  Demand for flood insurance 111 112 113 114 (National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy 2011) (Sandink, et al.\n","9433:  2010) (National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy 2011) (Hallegatte 2006) 85 will be low outside of risk areas.\n","9440:  Demand for flood insurance is concentrated in areas with a high risk of flooding; few people would voluntarily purchase insurance specifically to protect against flooding if they did not live in a flood risk area.\n","9442:  Adverse selection results in insurance rates that are prohibitively high for homeowners.\n","9446:  Bundling insurance to include flood or erosion coverage can make it unavoidable, or effectively compulsory.\n","9456:  United States of America The National Flood Insurance Program is administered through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in cooperation with private insurance agencies.\n","9459:  In its early years, even subsidized rates did not provide a sufficient incentive for homeowners to purchase flood insurance or for communities to join the National Flood Insurance Program.\n","9460:  Subsequent legislative changes in 1974 and 1994 required federally insured or regulated lenders to require flood insurance as a condition of granting or continuing a loan for a building located in the Special Flood Hazard Area of a participating community.\n","9465:  This program offers flood insurance to homeowners, renters, and business owners.\n","9499:  Where the flood probability is greater than 1 in 75 years and improved flood defenses are provided, flood insurance for households and small businesses will be maintained.\n","9513:

al.\n","9519:  2010) (Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) 2010) 88 Of particular interest is a policy calling on local planning authorities to _reduce risk from coastal change by avoiding inappropriate development in vulnerable areas or adding to the impacts of physical changes on the coast._ Local planning authorities are called on to identify as a Coastal Change Management Area any area likely to be affected by physical changes on the coast and make clear what development will be appropriate in such areas and in what circumstances, as well as to make provision for the relocation of development and infrastructure where this is needed.\n","9527:  If an area is subject to flood hazard, the property owner will suffer inconvenience in the event of a flood but little economic risk.\n","9533:  Flood insurance can address all of these concerns to some degree, because it will transfer some of the risk away from senior governments and onto private property owners through insurance premiums.\n","9542:  Would better align risk management objectives.\n","9543:  Homeowners who choose to purchase in areas at risk would pay for the additional risk and those in low risk areas would benefit from risk avoidance.\n","9545:  Flood insurance premiums will spread risk with other geographical areas also subject to flood risk.\n","9546:  Owners of residential dwellings would

distinction between deciding not to act, and not acting because of inertia or failing to consider alternatives.9 A strategic, or planned approach to climate change adaptation has a number of key benefits for local governments: _ Greater opportunities for adopting measures that have co-benefits and align with other community goals can be explored; _ _ _ _ Time can be taken to evaluate and address potential insurance and liability issues arising from climate change impacts; Cost savings can be realized by considering climate change impacts in the regular maintenance/updating/renewal schedule of existing infrastructure and by planning for new infrastructure to avoid expensive upgrades later; Adaptation measures that have unintended adverse impacts are more likely to be avoided if they have been identified and evaluated in advance; Emergency needs can be identified and prioritized in advance of crises; _ Opportunities for cooperation with other governments and agencies can be explored; _ _ _ Communities can be consulted and engaged in developing and implementing responses; Steps can be taken to enhance the resilience of vulnerable ecosystems before environmental thresholds are reached; and Local governments can avoid committing to development patterns or development in areas that will pose significant risks for inhabitants over the longer term as a result of climate change impacts.\n","13064:  It should be noted that not all impacts listed will occur in all regions.\n","13065:  Because the climate is changing, and will continue to change, local governments will
