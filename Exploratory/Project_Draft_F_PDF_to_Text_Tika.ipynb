      "\n",
      "Disaster Financial Assistance is a program managed by New Brunswick \n",
      "Emergency Measures Organization within the Department of Public Safety. \n",
      "There are two important steps to this program. \n",
      "\n",
      "First Step: After any disaster, NB EMO assesses the damages that have \n",
      "occurred.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second Step: Based on the information received and the Disaster Financial \n",
      "Assistance Policy, NB EMO makes a recommendation to government. \n",
      "Government then decides if a financial assistance program is needed. No \n",
      "assistance can be given until government approves a Disaster Financial \n",
      "Assistance Program.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you need assistance call Service New Brunswick at the following toll-\n",

      "\n",
      "It is important to note that we all have a duty to safeguard ourselves, and \n",
      "property from damage. Therefore, the Disaster Financial Assistance program \n",
      "does not pay for any damage or loss that is, or could be, covered by an \n",
      "insurance policy. Assistance, when provided, is only available after all other \n",
      "forms of disaster aid have been received and only covers uninsurable loss.\n",
      "\n",
      "You should contact your insurance company immediately to find out if the \n",

      "a deductible amount I have to pay?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, a deductible will be applied and is announced when the program is \n",

      "authorities. Those laws establish the regulatory and \n",
      "policy tools that control land use at the local level \n",
      "and define how and when they may be used. For \n",

impact of climate change and/\\nor take advantage of new opportunities. It involves \\nmaking adjustments in our decisions, activities and \\nthinking because of observed or expected changes \\nin climate.2\\n\\nSome ways municipalities act \\n•\\t planning and land use controls: zoning, official \\n\\nplans, development reviews\\n\\n•\\t provision of public services: utilities, public \\ntransit, road maintenance, snow removal, fire \\nand police, emergency preparedness\\n\\n•\\t forum for public dialogue and information: \\npublic awareness campaigns, deliberation \\non bylaws and programs, information on \\ncity\\xa0services\\n\\n•\\t collection of taxes and user fees: property \\ntaxes, recreational facility fees, parking fees \\n\\n•\\t management of public land and buildings: \\nestablishment of parks, renovation of civic \\nbuildings, operation of water treatment plants\\n\\nCanada’s climate is changing rapidly. Although all levels \\nof government have important roles to play to advance \\nadaptation, action at the local level is particularly important \\nbecause that is where many of the impacts of climate \\nchange will be felt most directly.1\\n\\nLocal governments in Canada can manage the risks and \\nopportunities presented by climate through a variety \\nof practices, including adoption and enforcement of \\nbylaws; collection of taxes and user fees; operation of \\ntransportation, utilities and other public infrastructure; \\nestablishment of subsidies, tax credits and other incentive \\nprograms; administration of emergency management \\nand response systems; and public outreach and \\neducation\\xa0initiatives.\\n\\nLand use planning is one of the most effective processes \\nto facilitate local adaptation to climate change.3,4 \\nHistorically, local governments have used land use planning \\ntools – official plans, zoning, development permits and \\nothers – to minimize risks to communities from floods, \\nwildfires, landslides and other natural hazards.5 As the \\nclimate changes, so will the frequency and magnitude of \\nclimate-related hazards, posing a challenge for community \\nplanners. A recent survey by the Canadian Institute of \\nPlanners confirmed that “planners gravitate to tools they \\nknow best and are looking for ways to adapt known tools \\nwhen addressing climate change.”6 \\n\\nP\\nH\\n\\nO\\nT\\n\\nO\\n C\\n\\nO\\nU\\n\\nR\\nT\\n\\nE\\nS\\n\\nY\\n O\\n\\nF\\n J\\n\\nE\\nR\\n\\nR\\nY\\n\\n M\\nO\\n\\nU\\nL\\n\\nA\\nN\\n\\nD\\n\\n\\n\\n2 |  L A N D  U S E  P L A N N I N G  T O O L S2 |  L A N D  U S E  P L A N N I N G  T O O L S\\n\\nPlanning tools and climate change \\nrisk reduction \\nGenerally speaking, planning tools can be used to \\nreduce climate risks in four ways:\\n\\n•\\t limiting development in hazard-prone areas\\n\\n•\\t ensuring that the built environment can \\nwithstand a range of environmental stress\\n\\n•\\t helping to preserve natural environments \\nthat protect communities against hazards \\n(for example, dunes that absorb coastal \\nstorm\\xa0effects) \\n\\n•\\t educating stakeholders and decision makers \\nabout risks and opportunities and fostering \\ndialogue about adaptation\\n\\nThis document describes tools in the land use planning \\nsector that communities can use in preparing to adapt to \\nclimate change. In addition, it provides information on \\ndecision-support tools, tools that provide information and \\nresources to help planners and local decision makers take \\neffective adaptation action. \\n\\nA brief example of each tool and its use by a Canadian \\ncommunity is given. Not every case discussed here was \\nexplicitly motivated by a desire to adapt to climate change. \\nHowever, the significance of the tool to adaptation \\nplanning is clear in each case. An effort was made to select \\nexamples from communities of varying sizes and from all \\nregions of Canada.  \\n\\nAlthough the examples are of broad utility, the design and \\napplication of a particular planning tool can vary greatly \\nfrom one jurisdiction to another, depending on provincial \\nor territorial laws and other factors. We describe the \\nprovincial and territorial roles in local adaptation planning \\nin Appendix A. Readers interested in knowing how a \\nparticular tool is applied in a specific community should \\nconsult provincial, territorial and local laws.\\n\\nIt is important to keep in mind that land use planning is \\nused to pursue many local policy objectives, including \\nproviding affordable housing, stimulating job growth, \\npreserving the character and heritage of a community, \\nreducing greenhouse gas emissions, protecting biodiversity \\nand enabling efficient transportation. A key challenge for \\nplanners and local decision makers is how to incorporate \\nand balance the need to prepare for climate change \\nthrough adaptation with other local development \\nobjectives. Another consideration is how to integrate \\n(mainstream) consideration of changing climate into \\nthe wide array of decisions made by local governments, \\nfrom operating municipal services to capital spending, \\nenforcement and inspection activities, collection of taxes, \\nand administration of disaster response programs.\\n\\n\\n\\nL A N D  U S E  P L A N N I N G  T O O L S  |  3 \\n\\nLAND USE PLANNING TOOLS ADAPTATION EXAMPLES PAGE\\n\\n2.1 Official plans Iqaluit’s General Plan 4\\n\\nElkford’s Official Community Plan 5\\n\\n2.2 Local plans on special matters Stratford’s Climate Change Adaptation Plan 6\\n\\nEdmonton’s Urban Forest Management Plan 7\\n\\nimagineCALGARY 7\\n\\n2.3 Zoning Beaubassin-est’s sea level rise protection zone 8\\n\\nRosemont–La Petite-Patrie’s zoning bylaw to reduce the  \\nurban heat island effect \\n\\n9\\n\\n2.4  Land subdivision and  \\ndevelopment controls\\n\\nToronto’s Green Standard 10\\n\\nHalifax Regional Municipality development agreements 11\\n\\n2.5 Covenants and easements Island Trust’s NAPTEP Covenant 12\\n\\nKamloops wildland-urban interface covenant 13\\n\\n2.6 Design guidelines Regina’s Xeriscape Workbook 14\\n\\nToronto’s Draft Design Guidelines for “Greening” Surface Parking Lots 15\\n\\n2.7  Environmental review of  \\ndevelopment projects\\n\\nSaint John waterfront redevelopment 16\\n\\nTown of Ajax environmental review of  \\nland development and infrastructure projects\\n\\n17\\n\\nP\\nH\\n\\nO\\nT\\n\\nO\\n C\\n\\nO\\nU\\n\\nR\\nT\\n\\nE\\nS\\n\\nY\\n O\\n\\nF\\n N\\n\\nA\\nR\\n\\nA\\nD\\n\\nA\\n T\\n\\nH\\nO\\n\\nM\\nA\\n\\nS\\n\\nThis section describes seven of the most prominent land \\nuse planning tools in use across Canada and explains how \\ncommunities can use them to more effectively adapt to \\nclimate change. \\n\\nLand use planning refers to the processes and instruments \\nemployed to manage the use of land and the physical \\ndevelopment of a community for the common interest. \\n\\nA variety of statutory and other measures – bylaws, \\nincentives, information and guidance, spending programs\\xa0– \\nmay be applied to control how land is used.

Provincial approval may be \\nrequired as well. \\n\\nAlso entitled general, community or master plans, these \\ndocuments identify the major social, economic and \\nenvironmental challenges facing the community and \\narticulate strategies to address them. Official plans are \\nin force for a relatively long period (10 years or longer) \\nwith updates required periodically (every five years in \\nsome provinces). They may designate some areas of the \\ncommunity as appropriate locations for new growth \\n\\nIqaluit’s General Plan8\\n\\nIqaluit (population 6200), the capital of Nunavut, is one of the first Canadian communities to integrate climate \\nchange adaptation into its General Plan. One of the five priority vision statements identifies Iqaluit as “a community \\nthat adapts to climate change.” The plan sets out two high-level objectives to realize this vision: (1) to study the \\nimpacts of climate change on the community and (2) to adopt policies that recognize the long-term impacts of \\nclimate change. The plan includes more detail on the climate change issues of concern to the community (for \\nexample, increases in temperature and precipitation, permafrost thaw, decreases in sea ice, and accelerated coastal \\nerosion) and priority adaptation actions related to municipal infrastructure.\\n\\nP\\nH\\n\\nO\\nT\\n\\nO\\n C\\n\\nO\\nU\\n\\nR\\nT\\n\\nE\\nS\\n\\nY\\n O\\n\\nF\\n M\\n\\nIC\\nH\\n\\nE\\nL\\n\\nE\\n B\\n\\nE\\nR\\n\\nT\\nO\\n\\nL\\n\\nwhile others are to be preserved or revitalised.

Such \\ntexts normally detail local climate change risks and \\nopportunities, an overarching adaptation vision and policy, \\nas well as priority adaptation needs. Adaptation strategies \\nand actions in official plans include mainstreaming \\nadaptation into all or selected municipal operations, \\nundertaking a comprehensive municipal risk assessment \\nprocess to prioritize risks and opportunities, developing \\na comprehensive municipal adaptation action plan, or \\nobtaining critical information or technical data for making \\neffective and appropriate adaptation decisions. \\n\\n\\n\\nL A N D  U S E  P L A N N I N G  T O O L S  |  5 \\n\\nElkford’s Official Community Plan9,10\\n\\nThe District of Elkford is a small community (population 2500) in the Rocky Mountains of southeastern British \\nColumbia. Historically, Elkford has dealt with several climate-related hazards, including flooding, drought and \\nwildfires. A changing climate magnifies all these risks. In 2008, Elkford, with support of the Columbia Basin Trust, \\na provincial crown corporation, developed a local adaptation strategy to assess the risks posed by climate change \\nand identify corresponding adaptation actions. The Adaptation Strategy was developed concurrently with a revision \\nto Elkford’s Official Community Plan (OCP), allowing the two to be fully integrated. Consideration of climate \\nchange in all decision making is one of the OCP’s 11 guiding principles. Adaptation actions in the OCP include \\na wildfire protection zone in which any development application must be accompanied by a fire hazard and risk \\nassessment conducted by certified professionals before a permit is issued. The OCP also calls for the development \\nof a community evacuation plan in the event of an extreme wildfire or flooding.\\n\\nP\\nH\\n\\nO\\nT\\n\\nO\\n C\\n\\nO\\nU\\n\\nR\\nT\\n\\nE\\nS\\n\\nY\\n O\\n\\nF\\n D\\n\\nIS\\nT\\n\\nR\\nIC\\n\\nT\\n O\\n\\nF\\n E\\n\\nL\\nK\\n\\nF\\nO\\n\\nR\\nD\\n\\n\\n\\n6 |  L A N D  U S E  P L A N N I N G  T O O L S\\n\\n2.2 LOCAL PLANS ON SPECIAL MATTERS \\nIn addition to official plans, local governments adopt \\nmany other kinds of plans. Those plans may focus on one \\nfunction of local government (such as public transit or \\nstorm water management), on a sector or issue of special \\nsignificance to the community (such as the development \\nof the arts or the needs of senior citizens) or on a \\nneighbourhood with special planning needs.11 As with \\nofficial plans, these local plans are often developed through \\na formal planning process, including public consultation, \\nand provide an assessment of conditions, a long-term vision \\nand a set of goals and actions for the particular issue or \\narea in question. \\n\\nA growing number of Canadian municipalities have \\nadopted plans that specifically address the need to adapt to \\nclimate change. Some communities have chosen to develop \\nstand-alone adaptation plans. Those documents typically \\noutline the climate change impacts of concern to the \\ncommunity, the associated risks and opportunities, and the \\ncommunity’s vision and proposed actions for dealing with \\nthose changes. Many other communities have integrated \\nconsideration of climate change adaptation into local plans \\nthat address other issues. For example, a municipality may \\nintegrate adaptation into its capital improvement plan for \\nstorm water sewer systems.\\n\\nStratford’s Climate Change Adaptation Plan12\\n\\nThe Town of Stratford (population 8046), a rapidly growing community in Prince Edward Island, is located on a \\npeninsula just south of the provincial capital, Charlottetown. The main climate change issues of concern to the \\ncommunity are coastal erosion, which already threatens several important heritage buildings and homes, sea level \\nrise, storm surge and inland flooding. \\n\\nIn 2010, the Town, in partnership with the Canadian Institute of Planners and the Atlantic Planners Institute, \\ncreated a long-term strategic plan to prepare Stratford for climate change. The process comprised four stages: \\n(1) forming a core working group to establish overarching objectives, engage key stakeholders and conduct \\nbackground research into local climate change impacts; (2) organizing public meetings to assess current and future \\nvulnerabilities (following a presentation of the potential climate change impacts, a survey was distributed to all \\nparticipants at the public meeting to gauge climate change-related opportunities and threats for the community); \\n(3) conducting a risk assessment, building on results of the vulnerability assessment, to rank the most important \\nclimate change impacts and identify priority areas for adaptation action; and (4) preparing a final adaptation plan \\nthat included recommended adaptation actions by theme (for example, heritage properties, parks and recreation, \\nprivate properties, emergency services, storm water infrastructure). Stratford has since integrated adaptation \\nconsiderations into all new or updated community action plans, including its draft Official Plan, Strategic Plan and \\nMaster Stormwater Management Plan.\\n\\nP\\nH\\n\\nO\\nT\\n\\nO\\n C\\n\\nO\\nU\\n\\nR\\nT\\n\\nE\\nS\\n\\nY\\n O\\n\\nF\\n W\\n\\nIN\\nS\\n\\nT\\nO\\n\\nN\\n M\\n\\nA\\nU\\n\\nN\\nD\\n\\n\\n\\nL A N D  U S E  P L A N N I N G  T O O L S  |  7 \\n\\nEdmonton’s Urban Forest Management Plan13\\n\\nEdmonton (population 812 201), the capital \\nof Alberta, is located along the North \\nSaskatchewan River. The city’s urban tree \\ncanopy is seriously threatened by drought, \\ninsect infestations, disease, storms and climate \\nchange. These threats spurred Edmonton to \\ncreate the Urban Forest Management Plan \\n(UFMP) to guide the management of the tree \\ncanopy over a 10-year period. The UFMP \\nincludes developing an inventory of the urban \\nforest (completed 2009), a review of existing \\nplanting strategies, a communication plan and \\npotential tree planting partnerships. Many \\nof these actions will increase resilience to \\ndrought conditions, which may be exacerbated \\nby climate change. For example, Edmonton’s \\nForestry Unit is testing the use of different tree \\nspecies, such as red maples, and alternative \\ntree watering techniques. \\n\\nimagineCALGARY14\\n\\nCalgary (population 1 096 833) is situated in southern Alberta. The impact of climate change on water quality and \\nquantity is of particular concern in the area. Local rivers are expected to experience decreased flow because of \\ndecreased precipitation and reduced glacial coverage in the headwaters of the river basins.15 imagineCALGARY was \\na community visioning and consultation process undertaken in 2005 to produce a 100-year roadmap for Calgary’s \\ndevelopment. The process engaged more than 18 000 Calgarians representing businesses, community agencies, \\nnon-profits and governments as well as the public. Calgary is one of the first communities in Canada to consider \\nclimate change in its long-range planning. The City commissioned scoping reports to investigate how four major \\ntrends might impact the city: demographic changes, resource scarcity, technology transformation and climate \\nchange. Since publishing the imagineCALGARY plan in 2007, the City has implemented its vision and targets in \\nsubsequent land use plans and strategies. Numerous local partner organizations in the private, non-profit and \\npublic sectors have also committed to achieving the vision by changing their policies and practices.\\n\\nP\\nH\\n\\nO\\nT\\n\\nO\\n C\\n\\nO\\nU\\n\\nR\\nT\\n\\nE\\nS\\n\\nY\\n O\\n\\nF\\n N\\n\\nIC\\nO\\n\\nL\\nA\\n\\n J\\nO\\n\\nH\\nN\\n\\nS\\nO\\n\\nN\\nP\\n\\nH\\nO\\n\\nT\\nO\\n\\n C\\nO\\n\\nU\\nR\\n\\nT\\nE\\n\\nS\\nY\\n\\n O\\nF\\n\\n T\\nH\\n\\nE\\n C\\n\\nIT\\nY\\n\\n O\\nF\\n\\n E\\nD\\n\\nM\\nO\\n\\nN\\nT\\n\\nO\\nN\\n\\n\\n\\n8 |  L A N D  U S E  P L A N N I N G  T O O L S\\n\\n2.3 ZONING \\nZoning is a regulatory tool widely used by municipalities \\nto control land use within their borders.7,16,17,18 It is a key \\ntool for implementing the goals and objectives set out \\nin a municipality’s official plan. Zoning bylaws divide \\nthe entire community into zones. For each zone, only \\ncertain land uses are permitted (for example, commercial, \\nresidential, industrial). In addition to restrictions on the \\nuse of the property, the zoning bylaws may impose \\nrequirements on buildings, including maximum height, \\nlot coverage and density, as well as building type and \\nsetbacks. Those requirements are reflected in a zoning \\nmap for the jurisdiction. Zoning restrictions usually apply \\nonly\\xa0prospectively.19\\n\\nZoning codes can be used by municipalities to limit new \\ndevelopment in hazard-prone areas (for instance in areas \\nsubject to wildfires, landslides or coastal erosion) or to \\nprescribe building standards that reduce vulnerability to \\nenvironmental stress.20,21 For example, in areas of high \\nflood risk, all development may be prohibited, while in \\nareas where the risk is lower, the ground floor of new \\nbuildings and structures may be required to be built \\nabove a minimum height to avoid flood damage.22 Given \\nthat climate change often magnifies existing hazard risk, \\nmunicipalities could respond by modifying existing zoning \\nrestrictions to factor in the greater intensity, frequency or \\nduration of certain hazards as climate changes.\\n\\nBeaubassin-est’s sea level rise protection zone23\\n\\nBeaubassin-est (population 6200), a small coastal community in southeast New Brunswick, is vulnerable to \\nthe impacts of sea level rise and storm surge flooding. The Community is one of the first in New Brunswick \\nto implement a minimum height standard for buildings to address climate change impacts. Council passed an \\nupdated zoning bylaw in March 2011 to better protect new construction in the community’s coastal zone. \\n\\nThe bylaw identifies a sea level rise “protection zone” in which the minimum ground floor elevation of any new \\nbuilding must be at least 1.43 metres above the current 1-in-100-year flood mark. The regulation is an overlay \\nzone\\xa0– all previous zoning conditions apply. Rather than restrict development outright, the zoning bylaw imposes \\nstricter building requirements on developers. This new regulation provides an opportunity to educate developers \\nas well as the community at large about the impacts of climate change and sea level rise. This update to the bylaw \\nwas based on the best available scientific understanding of sea level rise for the area and a high resolution digital \\nmap that the community commissioned to help identify potential flood levels. \\n\\nP\\nH\\n\\nO\\nT\\n\\nO\\n C\\n\\nO\\nU\\n\\nR\\nT\\n\\nE\\nS\\n\\nY\\n O\\n\\nF\\n S\\n\\nÉ\\nB\\n\\nA\\nS\\n\\nT\\nIE\\n\\nN\\n D\\n\\nO\\nIR\\n\\nO\\nN\\n\\n\\n\\nL A N D  U S E  P L A N N I N G  T O O L S  |  9 \\n\\nRosemont–La Petite-Patrie’s zoning bylaw to reduce the urban heat island effect24,25\\n\\nRosemont–La Petite-Patrie (population 131 000) is a central borough in Montréal, Quebec, that is very densely \\nbuilt. The urban heat island effect is pronounced in many parts of the borough. Urban heat islands are areas in \\ncities where ambient air temperatures tend to be hotter than in surrounding areas. They occur where there is little \\nvegetation and a high percentage of dark surfaces, such as tar roofs, asphalt roads and parking lots. \\n\\nIn April 2011, the borough council revised its comprehensive zoning bylaw to include four regulatory measures \\naimed at tackling urban heat islands: (1) when replacing an existing roof or constructing a new building, the owner \\nmust install either a green roof or a highly reflective roof; (2) for all new parking lots of 10 or more spaces, at least \\n15 percent of the area must be open ground landscaped with plants, bushes and trees; (3) all new paving materials \\nmust meet a minimum specified surface reflectivity rating; and (4) when constructing a new building, at least \\n20\\xa0percent of the building site must remain open ground and be landscaped with plants, bushes and trees. \\n\\nThese four measures apply to all public and private property throughout the borough. More than 300 permits for \\nreflective roofs were issued in the first year after the bylaw was passed. \\n\\nP\\nH\\n\\nO\\nT\\n\\nO\\n C\\n\\nO\\nU\\n\\nR\\nT\\n\\nE\\nS\\n\\nY\\n O\\n\\nF\\n R\\n\\nO\\nS\\n\\nE\\nM\\n\\nO\\nN\\n\\nT\\n –\\n\\n L\\nA\\n\\n P\\nE\\n\\nT\\nIT\\n\\nE\\n-P\\n\\nA\\nT\\n\\nR\\nIE\\n\\n\\n\\n10 |  L A N D  U S E  P L A N N I N G  T O O L S\\n\\n2.4 LAND SUBDIVISION AND DEVELOPMENT CONTROLS\\nCommunities across Canada employ many different tools \\nto control the layout and design of proposed developments \\nand to reduce adverse impacts on the community. The \\ncontrols, which may apply to subdivisions of land, new \\nconstruction or alterations to existing buildings, allow local \\nofficials to evaluate projects case by case.7 Among them are\\n\\n•\\t subdivision controls – which apply when a developer \\nwants to divide a parcel of land, often for residential \\ndevelopment. Generally, subdivision plans must \\ndemonstrate good access and efficient utility service \\nfor all the proposed lots and also address concerns \\nabout financial, environmental and other\\xa0impacts.\\n\\n•\\t site plan controls, development permits, \\ndevelopment agreements and similar tools – \\nwhich require developers to submit detailed designs \\nto be assessed against specified criteria. For example, \\na proposal may be reviewed for the quality of the \\ndesign of public areas, the fit with the historic \\ncharacter of the neighbourhood, or the extent of \\ndisturbance to ecologically sensitive land.\\n\\n•\\t comprehensive development zones, planned \\nunit developments and similar instruments – \\nthat apply to large sites in which non-standard or \\ninnovative designs and techniques are to be used, \\nand a customised approach to zoning and site design \\nis appropriate.\\n\\nAs part of the evaluation of proposals under these types \\nof regulations, local officials may seek changes to projects \\nprior to approval. Further, the developer may be required to \\npay development charges, dedicate a portion of the site for \\npublic use or provide some other concession or amenity.\\n\\nThese project-based, discretionary development controls \\ncan be very useful for adapting to climate change at the \\nneighbourhood scale. For example, as part of the review \\nof a subdivision proposal, the developer may be asked to \\nassess the increased risk of erosion due to climate change \\nand to determine how it may affect the development. \\nThe municipality may require that appropriate adaptation \\nmeasures be taken by the developer, such as shoreline \\nrestoration or increased development setbacks. The lots \\nin a proposed subdivision may be clustered in the least \\nhazardous part of the property. In other cases, a site plan \\ncontrol ordinance may be used to require that green design \\nfeatures that address the impacts of climate change be \\nincorporated (for instance, providing shade and rooftop \\ngardens to decrease the public health risk from urban \\nheat\\xa0islands). \\n\\nToronto’s Green Standard\\nToronto, Ontario (population 2.6 million), is situated at the centre \\nof a conurbation of more than 5 million people. Climate change \\nimpacts of concern for the city include increased health risks due \\nto extreme heat, higher incidence of pests and diseases (such as \\nWest Nile virus) and more extreme rainfall with consequences for \\nstorm-water systems and other infrastructure.26\\n\\nThe Toronto Green Standard (TGS) is a set of performance \\nmeasures for site and building design, covering energy and water \\nefficiency, air and water quality, ecological services and solid waste \\nmanagement. The standards work with the regular development \\napproval and inspection process, and apply to all new development subject to subdivision or site plan controls or \\nfor which a zoning amendment is required.27 Although adaptation is not explicitly mentioned, the TGS addresses \\nseveral climate change impacts of concern to the city. For example, one provision, applicable to non-residential \\ndevelopment of three stories or less, requires the use of light-coloured materials, open-grid pavement or shading \\non at least 50 percent of the site to reduce urban heat. Another provision requires that new developments retain at \\nleast the first 5 millimetres (mm) from each rainfall through rainwater reuse, plantings and other practices, thereby \\nreducing storm water runoff. A more stringent set of voluntary standards has been adopted. Developments that \\nmeet those stricter standards are eligible for reductions in development fees.\\n\\nP\\nH\\n\\nO\\nT\\n\\nO\\n C\\n\\nO\\nU\\n\\nR\\nT\\n\\nE\\nS\\n\\nY\\n O\\n\\nF \\nT\\n\\nH\\nE\\n\\n C\\nIT\\n\\nY\\n O\\n\\nF\\n T\\n\\nO\\nR\\n\\nO\\nN\\n\\nT\\nO\\n\\n\\n\\nL A N D  U S E  P L A N N I N G  T O O L S  |  11 \\n\\nHalifax Regional Municipality development agreements\\nHalifax Regional Municipality (HRM) (population 390 000) is the most populous urban community in Atlantic \\nCanada and the capital of Nova Scotia. Climate change, which is expected to bring more frequent storms to the \\narea, will likely increase the vulnerability of coastal development and infrastructure.28 Various community plans, \\nincluding the 2006 HRM Regional Plan, already call for new developments to be constructed a minimum height \\nabove the ordinary high-water mark.29 \\n\\nOne flexible mechanism that planners in Halifax use to address coastal threats is development agreements. Certain \\nareas of the community are designated as zones where review and approval of development projects proceed \\nthrough negotiation. Local bylaws specify in general terms the matters to be considered in such negotiations, \\ngiving planners latitude to address a broad range of issues regarding environmental protection, natural hazards \\nand other concerns.30 The developer may be asked to produce relevant information (such as the impacts of \\nwave-run up on a particular property) and to consider and adopt appropriate hazard mitigation strategies. In a \\nrecent development in downtown Dartmouth (an HRM municipality), local officials and the developer agreed to \\nestablish minimum elevations for a new marina and other seaside structures that were several metres higher than \\nprovided in area plans. This was consistent both with the developer’s interest in protecting the property and the \\ncommunity’s interest in minimizing risk. The development agreement process enabled planners and developers to \\nexchange information on storm surge and wave run up on this site, and to produce a more resilient project design. \\n\\nP\\nH\\n\\nO\\nT\\n\\nO\\n C\\n\\nO\\nU\\n\\nR\\nT\\n\\nE\\nS\\n\\nY\\n O\\n\\nF\\n H\\n\\nA\\nL\\n\\nIF\\nA\\n\\nX\\n R\\n\\nE\\nG\\n\\nIO\\nN\\n\\nA\\nL\\n\\n M\\nU\\n\\nN\\nIC\\n\\nIP\\nA\\n\\nL\\nIT\\n\\nY\\n\\n\\n\\n12 |  L A N D  U S E  P L A N N I N G  T O O L S\\n\\n2.5 COVENANTS AND EASEMENTS\\nCovenants and easements (known as real servitudes in \\nQuebec) are formal agreements that place restrictions on \\nthe use of land or grant a person (or the public) the right \\nto use land owned by another.31,32 For example, a covenant \\nmay prohibit building a structure that casts a shadow on \\na neighbouring property. An easement may allow the \\npublic to pass through private land to reach a beach. Both \\ncovenants and easements are said to “run with the land,” \\nwhich means they bind current as well as future owners. \\nThere are strict and complex legal requirements that apply \\nwhen creating easements or covenants. \\n\\nCovenants may serve local planning goals in different ways: \\n\\n•\\t as a development control tool – Municipalities \\nmay use covenants when entering development \\nagreements, applying controls on subdivisions and \\nother development projects or imposing conditions \\non issuing a development permit. In such cases, \\nthese instruments ensure that community interests \\nare protected and that the developer’s promises \\nabout the operation and maintenance of the \\nproperty are enforceable long after construction. \\nCovenants may be used in “green developments” \\nthat use innovative energy, waste water treatment \\nand other systems that require public access and the \\ncollaboration of future owners for proper operation \\nand maintenance.33\\n\\n•\\t as a conservation tool – A special form of \\ncovenant, known as a conservation covenant or \\neasement has been established by law in many \\nprovinces. It places restrictions on the use of land to \\nprotect its natural values. For example, a conservation \\ncovenant may prohibit the removal of native \\nvegetation and prohibit any structures on a portion \\nof the property that contains sensitive ecosystems. \\nThe owner who enters into a conservation covenant \\ncontinues to own the land and may live on it, sell it, \\nor pass it on to heirs but the covenant’s restrictions \\non development are followed in the future, regardless \\nof who owns the land.34 In exchange, the land owner \\nmay be eligible for tax reductions or credits.\\n\\nCovenants and easements can play an important role \\nin climate change adaptation planning. For example, \\na municipality may acquire a conservation easement \\nto prevent residential development on a coastal area \\nthreatened by sea level rise and storm surge flooding.  \\nA covenant may be negotiated with owners in an area to \\nprevent construction of docks, sea walls or other coastal \\nprotection structures in order to allow marshes and dunes \\nto migrate inland naturally.35 Covenants and easements may \\nalso support local efforts to monitor climate change by, for \\nexample, allowing access to a coastal property for purposes \\nof measuring erosion rates. \\n\\nIsland Trust’s NAPTEP Covenant\\nThe Islands Trust (population 25 000) is a federation of local governments \\nin the Gulf Islands and Howe Sound islands of British Columbia. The Islands \\nTrust Fund acts as the conservation arm of the federation, charged with \\nprotecting the ecosystems in the region through land acquisition, conservation \\ncovenants and education programs. Since 1990, it has protected more than \\n1073\\xa0hectares (ha) of land on 84 properties.36 \\n\\nAdaptation to climate change, especially the protection of biodiversity, is one \\nkey concern of the Trust Fund. The effects of changing climate are already \\nevident in local ecosystems: vegetation is experiencing earlier green-up, \\nwildlife migration patterns are changing, and insect outbreaks are more \\ncommon.37 Up to 30 percent of assessed animal species are believed to be \\nat high risk of extirpation (local extinction).38 By establishing, monitoring and \\nmanaging conservation areas, the Trust Fund aims to maintain the ecological \\nfunctions of high biodiversity areas in the face of a changing climate. Under \\nthe Trust Fund’s Natural Area Protection Tax Exemption Program (NAPTEP) \\nCovenant, land owners receive a 65 percent reduction in property taxes on \\nthe protected portion of their land. The Trust Fund is developing a tool to \\nestimate the biodiversity value of properties to prioritize future acquisitions.\\n\\nP\\nH\\n\\nO\\nT\\n\\nO\\n C\\n\\nO\\nU\\n\\nR\\nT\\n\\nE\\nS\\n\\nY\\n O\\n\\nF\\n E\\n\\n. \\nG\\n\\nO\\nN\\n\\nZ\\nA\\n\\nL\\nE\\n\\nS\\n\\n\\n\\nL A N D  U S E  P L A N N I N G  T O O L S  |  13 \\n\\nKamloops wildland-urban interface covenant\\nKamloops (population 85 678), in the Thompson River Valley of central southern British Columbia, is particularly \\nvulnerable to wildfires because of its dry climate. Wildfires are one of several risks projected to increase as a result \\nof changing climate. In the summer of 2003, three large wildfires reached the city’s perimeter, threatening homes \\nand infrastructure. They increased local awareness and concern about the impacts of wildfires on the community.\\n\\nCovenants are one of a suite of tools the City uses in its efforts to reduce wildfire risk.39 In 1992, the City instituted \\na policy specifying that, as a condition of subdivision approval, all new subdivisions within hazardous zones must \\nregister a restrictive covenant.40 Under such a covenant, developers and home owners are bound to undertake \\nactions to reduce fire risks, including maintaining fuel-buffer zones around homes; controlling roofing materials \\nand installation of wooden shacks and shingles; screening of all eaves, attics, decks and openings under floors \\nto prevent the accumulation of flammable material; and installing approved spark arresters in all wood stoves. All \\nsubdivisions constructed since 1992 in high to extreme wildfire hazard areas have registered restrictive wildfire \\ncovenants.

A combination of text and \\nphotographs, sketches and architectural drawings describe \\npreferred designs. \\n\\nMunicipalities often develop these publications as \\nsupplementary educational tools to help developers, design \\nprofessionals (such as architects, landscape architects, \\nengineers and planners) or the general public to improve \\nupon existing design and construction practices. They \\nalso illustrate various ways in which developers may meet \\nrequired municipal or provincial development standards. \\n\\nSome municipalities require that developers comply with \\nsuch design guidelines and demonstrate compliance during \\nthe formal review of development proposals.\\n\\nThe design of a community’s physical components – such \\nas parking lots, parks and roadways, drainage ditches or \\na neighbourhood as a whole – can reduce or magnify \\nthe impacts of climate change at the local scale.41,42 \\nGood design can contribute to building resilience to \\nclimate change at the local level.43 For example, selecting \\nappropriate building materials and landscaping can reduce \\nthe risk of wildfires. Although many municipalities have \\ndeveloped design guidelines without climate change in \\nmind, their use can improve resilience to the impacts \\nof climate change. Conversely, design guidelines may \\nrecommend or impose development standards that may \\ninadvertently decrease resilience to climate change. For \\nexample, a municipality may prescribe building wide roads \\nto accommodate emergency vehicles. However, those wide \\nroads may also increase storm water volumes and magnify \\nthe urban heat island effect.\\n\\nRegina’s Xeriscape Workbook44\\n\\nRegina, Saskatchewan (population 193 100), is situated in the middle of the southern prairies, the driest major \\nregion of Canada. The city has very little local access to water. For the Canadian prairies, increases in water scarcity \\nand drought are one of the most serious risks presented by climate change. \\n\\nXeriscape is an alternate form of landscaping that relies on drought-tolerant plants to reduce outdoor watering \\nrequirements during the summer. In 1993, the City of Regina produced the Xeriscape Workbook, which provides \\npractical guidelines for low-water, low-maintenance landscaping. The Workbook is distributed at free workshops in \\nthe spring and fall and on the  \\nCity’s Web site. In the late 1990s,  \\nthe City partnered with a local school \\nto create a xeriscape educational \\nand demonstration site. The garden \\nfeatures 45 plant types, a false creek \\nand an amphitheatre with a teacher’s \\nrock for outdoor classes and lessons. \\nClimate change was not a consideration \\nwhen the City first developed the \\nWorkbook. However, the application \\nof the landscaping practices within \\nthe Workbook helps reduce water \\nconsumption, an important climate \\nchange adaptation\\xa0action.

Traditionally, parking lot design \\nhas been based mainly on functional criteria (to maximize parking lot spaces and minimize maintenance costs) \\nwith little regard to the quality of the urban design or environmental performance. The new guidelines provide \\ndesign options and strategies, in both graphic and written form, to meet the following objectives: enhance the \\nsafety and attractiveness of the public realm, provide shade and high-quality landscaping, reduce the urban \\nheat island effect, manage storm-water quality and quantity on-site, and incorporate sustainable material and \\ntechnologies. All proposals for new parking lots within city limits, both public and private, must consider the \\nguidelines before receiving development approval. The guidelines also help developers comply with the Toronto \\nGreen Standard. Although not designed explicitly as a climate change adaptation measure, the application of the \\nguidelines, particularly the urban heat island and storm-water management measures, increase the city’s resilience \\nto climate\\xa0change.\\n\\nP\\nH\\n\\nO\\nT\\n\\nO\\n C\\n\\nO\\nU\\n\\nR\\nT\\n\\nE\\nS\\n\\nY\\n O\\n\\nF\\n T\\n\\nH\\nE\\n\\n C\\nIT\\n\\nY\\n O\\n\\nF\\n T\\n\\nO\\nR\\n\\nO\\nN\\n\\nT\\nO\\n\\n\\n\\n16 |  L A N D  U S E  P L A N N I N G  T O O L S\\n\\n2.7 ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW OF DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS \\n\\nSaint John waterfront redevelopment\\nSaint John (population 70 063), the largest municipality in New Brunswick, is located on the north shore of the \\nBay of Fundy at the mouth of the Saint John River.

The street grid is to be extended, buildings renovated and new residences, shops and a hotel \\nconstructed. A portion of the development site was formerly a Canadian Coast Guard base and is owned by \\nFisheries and Oceans Canada. Accordingly, the transfer of the property to the Corporation requires a screening \\nunder the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act.49 The EA screening, completed in March of 2010, included \\nconsideration of the potential impacts of climate change and sea level rise on the project.50 The Corporation \\nagreed to ensure that the climate and potential sea level rise are considered where relevant in the design of the \\ninfrastructure components of the project. The loadings and stresses associated with climate change, potential sea \\nlevel rise and other environmental forces are to be addressed through engineering design as the planning for the \\nproject continues. \\n\\nP\\nH\\n\\nO\\nT\\n\\nO\\n C\\n\\nO\\nU\\n\\nR\\nT\\n\\nE\\nS\\n\\nY\\n O\\n\\nF \\nM\\n\\nA\\nC\\n\\n M\\nA\\n\\nR\\nO\\n\\nO\\nN\\n\\nAn environmental assessment (EA) is a structured process \\nused by governments to evaluate the environmental, social \\nand economic impacts of development. It can be applied \\nto a specific project, such as the construction of a bridge \\nor to a plan or policy intended to guide future projects. \\nMany kinds of developments are required to undergo \\nan EA. For instance, federal and provincial law may \\nrequire EAs for major industrial projects, projects that use \\nfederal or provincial funds or for development on crown \\nlands.46 Some municipal infrastructure projects such as \\nextensions of sewers and the construction of water mains, \\nroads and transit systems may be subject to provincial \\nEA requirements. In 2003, the Canadian Environmental \\nAssessment Agency issued guidelines for incorporating \\nclimate change considerations in EAs, one of the first \\nfederal agencies in the world to do so.47 \\n\\nIn addition, municipalities can require formal environmental \\nreviews, sometimes called environmental impact studies \\n(EISs), as part of the local process for the evaluation of \\n\\ndevelopment proposals. For example, developers may be \\nrequired to submit an EIS for plans of a subdivision or for \\na building project located in or near sensitive or protected \\nareas. The scope and process for a particular EIS will \\nvary depending on the nature of the project, applicable \\nenvironmental and planning laws, policies in the official \\ncommunity plan and municipal bylaws, and the resources \\navailable to local authorities. \\n\\nEAs, EISs and other forms of environmental review have \\nproven to be ready platforms for consideration of climate \\nchange concerns. The applicable legislation and guidelines \\nfor EAs and EISs may require that local climate change be \\nincorporated as one aspect of the natural environment to \\nbe considered and that measures to address climate change \\nimpacts be incorporated into the project’s design and \\nmanagement plan. In other cases, climate change impacts \\nmay not be a direct consideration in the EA process. \\nDespite this, measures enacted in response to the EA may \\nhelp build resilience to a changing climate. \\n\\n\\n\\nL A N D  U S E  P L A N N I N G  T O O L S  |  17 \\n\\nTown of Ajax environmental review of land development and infrastructure projects\\nAjax, Ontario (population 109 600), is located on the north shore of Lake Ontario. Climate change is expected to \\nbring Ajax more frequent and more severe extreme weather. This, plus proposed urbanization in the region, could \\nincrease local risks such as flooding, fouled beaches and decreased water quality in Lake Ontario, the primary \\nsource of water for Ajax.51 \\n\\nAjax proactively uses EAs and EISs in its efforts to address climate change concerns. For example, to improve the \\nquality of water discharged into Lake Ontario, Ajax is developing a master plan for the retrofit of its storm-water \\nsystem. As part of that process, the Town conducted a Municipal Engineers Class EA to evaluate various retrofit \\nmeasures.52 The EA recommended a two-stage action plan involving (1) adopting “Healthy Community Practices,” \\nsuch as more strategic street sweeping practices, low-impact development approaches, community education \\nprograms and ongoing storm-water quality monitoring; and (2) using results from the monitoring program to \\ndetermine whether engineered measures, such as retrofits to sewers, trenches and channel expansions, are needed. \\n\\nFurther, pursuant to environmental and climate change adaptation policies in its Official Plan, Ajax requires that \\nan EIS be submitted with all applications for developments on land designated as a natural heritage or hydrologic \\nfeatures of provincial, regional or local significance. The EIS must evaluate adverse impacts of the proposed \\ndevelopment and establish appropriate actions to address those impacts. \\n\\nP\\nH\\n\\nO\\nT\\n\\nO\\n C\\n\\nO\\nU\\n\\nR\\nT\\n\\nE\\nS\\n\\nY\\n O\\n\\nF\\n K\\n\\nE\\nV\\n\\nIN\\n G\\n\\nA\\nY\\n\\nN\\nO\\n\\nR\\n\\n\\n\\n18 |  L A N D  U S E  P L A N N I N G  T O O L S\\n\\nDecision-support tools are designed to assist decision \\nmakers in the process of developing and implementing \\nclimate change adaptation plans and policies.

Assessments can take several forms.i Some \\nemphasize projections of climate change impacts in \\nthe community, while others focus on the factors that \\nproduce local vulnerability and constrain the ability of the \\ncommunity to take adaptive actions. The knowledge gained \\nthrough vulnerability and risk assessments can help decision \\nmakers develop effective adaptation measures. \\n\\nMany guidelines and frameworks have been developed \\nto help communities undertake local climate change \\nassessments.57 Some are generic tools that may apply \\ngenerally to all communities, while others are targeted \\nto certain types of communities (for example, rural \\ncommunities) or particular forms of climate change impacts \\n(for example, heat-related health risks). Many forms of \\nknowledge, including scientific and technical expertise and \\nlocal and traditional knowledge, can contribute to local \\nassessments of climate change impacts and adaptation. \\n\\nVULNERABILITY ASSESSMENTS \\n\\nA vulnerability assessment is a structured process for \\nidentifying the vulnerability of human and natural systems \\nto climate change.58 The more exposed and sensitive an \\nindividual or community is to climate change, the higher \\nits vulnerability. Vulnerability is also a function of adaptive \\ncapacity; the higher a community’s capacity to undertake \\nadaptive actions, the less vulnerable it is. \\n\\nWhen conducting a vulnerability assessment, a broad \\nrange of socio-economic and physical factors should be \\nconsidered, including climate conditions, the adequacy of \\nhousing and local infrastructure, the quality of emergency \\nresponse systems and assistance networks, the availability \\n\\nP\\nH\\n\\nO\\nT\\n\\nO\\n C\\n\\nO\\nU\\n\\nR\\nT\\n\\nE\\nS\\n\\nY\\n O\\n\\nF\\n J\\n\\nE\\nR\\n\\nR\\nY\\n\\n M\\nO\\n\\nU\\nL\\n\\nA\\nN\\n\\nD\\n\\ni The IPCC56 described several distinct conceptual frameworks for assessments of local climate change, including impact-based approaches that are climate scenario driven, adaptation-based \\napproaches that focus on the capacity of communities and natural systems to respond effectively to stress, vulnerability-based approaches centered on the factors driving the susceptibility \\nof individuals and groups to harm, integrated approaches that include modelling and other procedures for investigating climate change across sectors and scales and risk management \\napproaches that focus directly on decision making.\\n\\nof material and financial resources, and the general health \\nand risk awareness of the population.59,60 Consultation with \\nlocal stakeholders and residents is crucial in assessments, \\nboth to understand existing vulnerabilities and to develop \\neffective strategies to reduce them. The information gained \\nfrom vulnerability assessments allows local officials to \\ndevelop appropriate interventions such as improved health \\nservices, better access to transportation networks, and \\nhealthier buildings and urban spaces. The assessments also \\nhelp to prioritize measures to assist the most vulnerable \\nindividuals and groups in a timely and cost-effective manner. \\n\\nRISK MANAGEMENT\\n\\nRisk management is a process widely used by businesses, \\ngovernments and non-governmental organizations to \\nidentify and manage the adverse impacts of a change \\nin conditions. The magnitude of a risk is calculated by \\nexamining the probability of the occurrence of an event and \\nthe severity of its impact. Risk management helps decision \\nmakers evaluate multiple threats and prioritize policy \\nresponses under conditions of uncertainty. \\n\\nRisk management processes can be used by a community \\nto evaluate risks associated with climate change and \\nsuggest adaptation measures. Risk management \\nmethodologies can provide a way to explore public \\nattitudes and perceptions of risk, and this information can \\nfeed back into the assessment. The evaluation process \\nmay be formal or informal and may be quantitative \\nor qualitative, depending on what works best for the \\nmunicipality. In addition to common risk management \\nprocesses (for example, ISO31000, CSA Q850), which can \\nbe used to assess climate change risks, several climate \\nchange-specific risk assessment tools have been developed \\nto assist Canadian communities (see Appendix A). \\n\\n3.1  ASSESSMENTS OF COMMUNITY VULNERABILITY \\nAND RISK\\n\\n\\n\\n20 |  L A N D  U S E  P L A N N I N G  T O O L S\\n\\nHeat and health vulnerability assessment in Windsor, Ontario\\nWindsor (population 210 891) is Canada’s most southerly city and has summertime temperatures that are among \\nthe highest in Canada.61 Climate change is expected to significantly increase the number of extreme heat days \\nannually in the region. This may exacerbate the risk of heat-related illness and deaths, particularly among seniors, \\nthe chronically ill and other vulnerable groups. \\n\\nWindsor was one of four pilot communities in a Health Canada project to develop community-based Heat Alert \\nand Response Systems (HARSs) to alert local residents when extreme temperatures pose a serious health concern \\nand to activate a coordinated public health response. The City of Windsor and Health Canada collaborated to \\nconduct a heat-health vulnerability assessment to help strengthen the design of the HARS as well as to engage \\nimportant stakeholders. The vulnerability assessment proceeded in five steps:62 (1) an initial assessment of the \\nscope, objectives, work plan and stakeholders involved; (2) the collection and analysis of data, including an \\nexamination of the relationship between temperature and mortality; (3) the projection of future climate for the \\nWindsor region; (4) a literature review to provide background information about the impacts of heat on health, \\nvulnerability assessment methods, and best adaptation practices; and (5) workshops to consult with stakeholders \\nand the community about existing vulnerabilities, adaptive capacity and potential adaptation actions.

These models are complex \\ncomputer programs that simulate the behaviour of the \\natmosphere, the oceans, land surfaces, clouds and other \\nkey components of the climate system.67 The models depict \\nfuture conditions at different scales – some encompass \\nthe entire globe while others focus on specific regions. \\nGenerally, uncertainty increases at the finer spatial \\nscales. To examine future climates, models incorporate \\nassumptions about greenhouse gas emissions in the \\nfuture. For example, some assume fast-rising emissions \\nwhile others assume more gradual growth and eventual \\nreductions in emissions. Uncertainty is an inherent part of \\nall climate projections, owing to challenges in modelling \\ncomplex climate systems and in foreseeing future global \\nactions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\\n\\nClimate change projections may be applied to local \\nplanning processes in various ways, including the following:\\n\\n•\\t as tools for learning and public engagement. \\nPlanners may present climate projections to \\nstakeholders and the public to raise awareness \\nabout the nature and magnitude of possible changes \\nto the local climate, thus stimulating discussion \\namongst stakeholders about potential impacts, \\nlocal vulnerabilities, adaptive capacity and preferred \\napproaches to adaptation.\\n\\n•\\t as part of assessments of community \\nvulnerabilities and risks. In formulating adaptation \\nplans, communities often utilize climate projections \\nwhen studying the nature and extent of local risk \\nand vulnerabilities, including the capacity of key \\nstakeholders and residents to cope with and respond \\neffectively to increased stress. \\n\\n•\\t as parameters for setting the design tolerance \\nof systems and structures. For example, a \\nmunicipality may, based on projected changes in the \\nintensity of future rainfall events, change the design \\ncriteria for the diameter of storm-water pipes to \\naccommodate greater flows.\\n\\nAlthough projections are a useful decision-support tool, \\nthere are adaptation measures that communities can take \\nwithout having to use or commission climate projections. \\nCommunities can, for example, base their adaptation \\nplanning decisions on an analysis of current vulnerabilities \\nor on information gleaned from reliable regional, national \\nor international assessments (which make use of climate \\nprojections). It is important that planners are cognizant of \\nthe inherent uncertainties embedded in projections and \\ncommunicate them accurately to decision makers and \\nthe\\xa0public. \\n\\n\\n\\nL A N D  U S E  P L A N N I N G  T O O L S  |  23 \\n\\nHalifax Harbour plan for sea level rise68,69\\n\\nHalifax (population 390 000), the capital of Nova Scotia, is a major seaport with significant industrial, military and \\nmunicipal infrastructure on the coast. Rising sea level, along with increased storm intensity and associated waves \\nand storm surges, presents risks to residents, property and infrastructure in coastal areas of the city. To respond \\nto these impacts, in 2006 the city recognized the need to gather scientific data on sea level rise, storm surges and \\nvulnerability to inform development of an area-specific land use plan for Halifax Harbour.\\n\\nCity planners partnered with a team of scientists to develop projections of future sea levels and storm water levels \\nin Halifax Harbour under three climate scenarios for 2100: (1) a continuation of the historical rate of change, (2) the \\nupper-limit projection for mean sea level rise from the fourth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel \\non Climate Change (IPCC) and (3) a projection based on more recent scientific literature. High-resolution mapping \\nof possible future flood levels was then produced for each scenario. Following a presentation by scientists and \\ncity staff, Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM) Council in 2010 chose scenario 2c as a policy reference point from \\nwhich to develop the adaptation strategy. HRM is also committed to re-examining this choice when additional \\nscientific information becomes available. This example demonstrates that credible climate projections, based \\non best available science that are communicated to the public and decision makers in a format that is easily \\nunderstandable, provide a helpful foundation for adaptation action at the municipal level. \\n\\nS\\nC\\n\\nE\\nN\\n\\nA\\nR\\n\\nIO\\n 2\\n\\nC\\n -\\n\\n I\\nM\\n\\nA\\nG\\n\\nE\\n C\\n\\nO\\nU\\n\\nR\\nT\\n\\nE\\nS\\n\\nY\\n O\\n\\nF\\n D\\n\\nO\\nN\\n\\n F\\nO\\n\\nR\\nB\\n\\nE\\nS\\n\\n\\n\\n24 |  L A N D  U S E  P L A N N I N G  T O O L S\\n\\nClimate projections informing adaptation planning in Prince George\\nThe City of Prince George (population 77 000) is situated at the confluence of the Nechako and upper Fraser rivers \\nin central British Columbia.

To help the community prepare for \\nfuture climate changes, a scenario planning project was conducted in 2009, led by a local college in collaboration \\nwith the territorial government, local and First Nations governments, private sector firms and community groups.76,77 \\n\\nIn a series of meetings, members of the community identified local vulnerabilities under four possible “future \\nhistories” of Whitehorse. To create those histories, two climate change scenarios and two development scenarios \\nwere generated. For instance, Scenario 4, entitled City of Crossroads, envisions a high degree of climate change \\n(median temperature rise of 4°C) as well as significant population growth (24 000 new residents). The other future \\nhistories have different assumptions regarding climate change and development. Participants brainstormed on the \\nsocial, economic and environmental consequences associated with each scenario. Certain impacts or concerns \\nthat were common across the four histories were deemed to be consequences most likely to occur and therefore \\nbecame priorities for developing adaptation actions. The priorities included increased risk of forest fire, shifts in the \\navailability of water, infrastructure decline, energy and food security, and potential land use conflicts. The study \\nalso allowed planners to identify the range of impacts that any one adaptation measure could address and how \\nthese measures may fit with other planning initiatives. \\n\\nClimate changes (e.g. extent of temperature  \\nrise and increase in snow)\\n\\nsome climate change lots of climate change\\n\\nDevelopment trajectory \\n(e.g. population growth)\\n\\nlow Scenario 1:  \\nCity of Wilderness\\n\\nScenario 2:  \\nCity of People\\n\\nhigh Scenario 3:  \\nCity of Mettle\\n\\nScenario 4:  \\nCity of Crossroads\\n\\nA scenario is a plausible, simplified description of \\nhow the future may develop. Scenario planning is a \\nstrategic medium- to long-term planning tool in which \\nplanners develop multiple scenarios describing potential \\nsocial, economic and environmental conditions in a \\ncommunity and then formulate strategies and measures \\nto achieve planning goals under one or more of those \\nscenarios.73 Long used by government and the private \\nsector for managing uncertainty, scenario planning is \\nnow being applied by some communities to prepare for \\nclimate\\xa0change.\\n\\nIn planning for adaptation to climate change, planners \\ndevise scenarios that demonstrate how changes in climate \\nmay affect the community under different development \\ntrajectories (see the diagram in the following Whitehorse \\nexample). The development trajectories are based on a few \\nkey variables expected to drive change, such as population \\ngrowth, technological shifts or energy demand. Different \\nnarratives about how climate change may unfold in the \\n\\ncommunity are derived from scientific projections, expert \\nassessments and other sources.74\\n\\nPlanning scenarios assist adaptation planning and policy-\\nmaking in several ways. The process of constructing the \\nscenarios educates stakeholders about the nature and \\nextent of future climate-related risks and opportunities. \\nScenarios may provide information that helps to identify \\nemerging vulnerabilities (for example, potential conflict \\nover access to water) and support efforts to prioritize \\nclimate change risks. They also assist in devising adaptation \\nstrategies and actions to address vulnerabilities. The \\nmost robust measures are those effective across different \\nscenarios. For example, in communities at risk from \\nwildfires, proper firebreak maintenance can be a useful \\nadaptation measure regardless of the magnitude of climate \\nchange experienced and the rate of development. In \\nother cases, planners may develop contingent adaptation \\nstrategies that would be implemented in the event a \\nparticular scenario begins to unfold.75\\n\\n\\n\\n26 |  L A N D  U S E  P L A N N I N G  T O O L S\\n\\n3.4 VISUALIZING CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS\\n\\nToronto’s heat vulnerability mapping tool79\\n\\nAs the climate changes, Toronto is expected to \\nexperience more intense and prolonged heat \\nwaves. Extreme heat is a public health issue of \\nparticular concern to the city’s senior citizens, to \\npersons suffering from respiratory illnesses and to \\nother vulnerable populations. Toronto Public Health \\n(TPH) has developed a mapping tool to visualize \\nareas of elevated human vulnerability to extreme \\nheat. The maps incorporate numerous indicators of \\nvulnerability, including surface temperatures, green \\nspace coverage, housing and social characteristics \\nof at-risk populations, access to air conditioning, \\nand the location of cool places. The tool helps TPH \\nand community partners identify and prioritize \\ngeographic hot spots for delivering resources during \\na heat alert. The City also plans to use the tool for \\nlong-term climate adaptation planning. \\n\\nMaps and other landscape visualizations can illustrate, in \\na simple and effective manner,78 the nature and extent of \\nthe changes expected in the local climate, the severity of \\npossible impacts, and what proposed adaptation responses \\nmight look like. Such visualizations support decision making \\nby translating scientific concepts into maps or images \\nthat have clear and practical meaning to non-scientists \\nand the public. They can facilitate dialogue during the \\nplanning\\xa0process.\\n\\nMAPS\\n\\nMaps are one of the most common adaptation decision-\\nsupport tools used by planners. They can range from \\nsimple hand-drawn maps to those developed by using \\nsophisticated computer software. Maps have been used \\nto identify geographic areas of the municipality at risk \\nfrom climate-related impacts, the location of vulnerable \\ninfrastructure and populations, or to demarcate places \\nwhere certain adaptation-related policies apply. For \\nexample, the potential extent of shoreline erosion or storm \\nsurge flooding under various climate change scenarios \\n\\ncan be mapped. Maps can also be readily referenced or \\nincorporated into land use planning tools, such as zoning \\nbylaws, official plans and policy documents. \\n\\nVISUALIZATIONS\\n\\nIncreasingly, municipalities employ computer animation \\nsoftware to create three-dimensional visualizations at the \\nstreet and neighbourhood scales. The software combines \\nimages of the existing features of the community (for \\nexample, roads, buildings and trees near the shore) with \\nclimate-related impacts projected for the area (for example, \\nhigher sea level). The animations help people visualize \\nthe losses that may be incurred under such conditions \\nand illustrate the consequences of a particular adaptation \\nmeasure. For example, planners may want to create an \\nimage showing how raising a dike or levee would affect \\nviews of the ocean from various waterfront properties. The \\nresulting images may be useful in engaging the affected \\nland owners and the public when evaluating the merits of a \\nproposed adaptation measure, such as raising a sea dike.\\n\\nM\\nA\\n\\nP\\n C\\n\\nO\\nU\\n\\nR\\nT\\n\\nE\\nS\\n\\nY\\n O\\n\\nF\\n T\\n\\nO\\nR\\n\\nO\\nN\\n\\nT\\nO\\n\\n P\\nU\\n\\nB\\nL\\n\\nIC\\n H\\n\\nE\\nA\\n\\nLT\\nH\\n\\n\\n\\nL A N D  U S E  P L A N N I N G  T O O L S  |  27 \\n\\nDelta’s visualization of climate change impacts80,81\\n\\nDelta, British Columbia (population 99 863), is 17 kilometres south of Vancouver, at the mouth of the Fraser River. \\nThe low-lying community is at risk of flooding from sea level rise and increased intensity and frequency of storm \\nsurges.82 Since 2005, Delta has partnered with the Collaborative for Advanced Landscape Planning (CALP) at \\nthe University of British Columbia (UBC) to develop visualizations of the flooding risk to Delta. CALP and UBC’s \\nOkanagan campus developed a 3D virtual environment where Delta residents could see what adaptation actions \\nwould look like. For example, the following image shows a typical residential street inundated by flood waters \\nfollowing a major storm surge event. Delta officials found the visualization process useful in engaging local \\nresidents. Since the public consultations in 2007, Delta has integrated adaptation into various infrastructure and \\noperational decisions. \\n\\n\\n\\n28 |  L A N D  U S E  P L A N N I N G  T O O L S\\n\\n3.5 ADAPTATION PLANNING GUIDEBOOKS\\n\\nWindsor’s Climate Change Adaptation Plan\\nWindsor (population 216 000) is located in southwestern Ontario on the south shore of the Detroit River and Lake \\nSt. Clair. Climate change impacts of concern include an expected increase in the frequency and intensity of heavy \\nrain storms and heat waves (a doubling of the number of 30°C days has been projected by 2050).83 These changes \\ncould pose serious problems for the city. In 2010, for example, a significant rainstorm that delivered 90 mm of rain \\nin a 24-hour period led to widespread basement flooding throughout the city.84\\n\\nWindsor began developing its adaptation plan in 2010. The City is working through the five-step adaptation \\nplanning process outlined in Changing Climate, Changing Communities, a guidebook published by ICLEI Canada.85 \\nThe steps are initiate, research, plan, implement and monitor. The City is midway through that planning process. \\nThe development of Windsor’s adaptation plan builds on existing initiatives, including a heat alert and emergency \\nresponse system, the expansion of a waste water treatment facility, various initiatives aimed at reducing basement \\nflooding, and the construction of a new retention treatment basin to reduce combined sewer overflows. City officials \\nintend to integrate the actions identified in the adaptation plan into existing policies, programs and operations.\\n\\nP\\nH\\n\\nO\\nT\\n\\nO\\n C\\n\\nO\\nU\\n\\nR\\nT\\n\\nE\\nS\\n\\nY\\n O\\n\\nF \\nT\\n\\nO\\nU\\n\\nR\\nIS\\n\\nM\\n W\\n\\nIN\\nD\\n\\nSO\\nR\\n\\n E\\nSS\\n\\nE\\nX\\n\\n P\\nE\\n\\nLE\\nE\\n\\n I\\nSL\\n\\nA\\nN\\n\\nD\\n\\nSeveral Canadian guidebooks have been produced that \\ndescribe the steps a community can take to formulate \\nan adaptation strategy and action plan (see Appendix B). \\nSeveral of these guidebooks outline a standard planning \\nprocess that is then tailored with information that is \\nrelevant to preparing for the impacts of climate change. \\n\\nThe guidebooks are typically based on the experience and \\ninsights of pilot communities and may include case studies \\nand prepared worksheets, as well as tips and practical \\ninformation.

The town \\nis vulnerable to sea level rise and storm surge flooding. \\nIn 2010, the Government of Nova Scotia required \\nmunicipalities to prepare and submit a climate change \\naction plan by 2013 as a condition for receiving federal \\ngas-tax funds. In November 2011, the Province published \\nthe Municipal Climate Change Action Plan Guidebook \\nto help municipalities prepare their action plans.86 \\nYarmouth was one of three pilot communities to work \\nthrough the Guidebook. The lessons learned were used \\nto assist other municipalities in undertaking similar \\ninitiatives.\\n\\nYarmouth is developing a long-term strategic approach \\nfor managing climate change hazards. Between October \\n2011 and February 2012, with assistance from the \\nDalhousie School of Planning, Yarmouth worked through the six steps in the Guidebook. Before submitting its \\nPlan to the Province in 2013, the Town intends to host a public consultation session and continue to refine its \\nAction Plan. Despite some challenges, town staff found it to be a useful process. In particular, the formation of \\nthe steering committee, composed of staff from different departments, has allowed colleagues to work together \\nacross functional areas.\\n\\n Steps to develop an action plan\\n\\n1.

Those laws establish the regulatory and \\npolicy tools that control land use at the local level \\nand define how and when they may be used. For \\nexample, provincial planning acts prescribe the kinds \\nof zoning bylaws a municipality may adopt. The \\nprovinces define the suite of tools available to local \\ngovernment to design and implement adaptation \\nplans and measures.\\n\\n•\\t provincial planning policies – Provinces adopt \\nregulations and policies, to which local and regional \\nplans generally must conform, on planning issues \\nof concern across the province. Those policies may \\naddress topics relevant to local adaptation efforts. For \\ninstance, a province may prescribe planning standards \\ndesigned to protect agricultural land and contain \\nurbanization at the fringes of a metropolitan area. \\nThose standards may facilitate enhanced regional \\nfood security and the design of more resilient urban \\ncommunities.\\n\\n•\\t provincial adaptation plans and programs – \\nMany provinces have their own formal plans for \\nadapting to climate change. Typically, such plans \\nspecify provincial goals and objectives; identify the \\nimpacts of climate change on government programs, \\noperations and infrastructure; and suggest specific \\nactions. For example, a plan may call for more high-\\ndefinition aerial mapping or enhanced monitoring of \\nwater quality. Provinces also disseminate guidelines \\nand technical information and can act as facilitators \\nand conveners to assist local governments, the private \\nsector and civic organizations in adapting to climate \\nchange. Finally, provinces fund programs that can \\nsupport local adaptation (for example, subsidies for \\nan urban tree planting program to reduce the urban \\nheat island effect). \\n\\n•\\t direct involvement in development decisions\\xa0– \\nIn most local planning matters, the provincial \\ngovernment plays an indirect, oversight role (for \\ninstance, as appellate bodies on a zoning dispute \\nor as the final approving authority on local official \\nplans). In some circumstances, provincial officials \\nare directly involved in local development decisions. \\nThis may be the case for sites and issues that fall \\nunder direct provincial jurisdiction, such as highway \\nconstruction, unincorporated communities, local \\nprojects on crown land, projects affecting heritage \\nproperties, and environmental assessments of large \\ninfrastructure projects. In such cases, provincial \\nofficials may contribute directly to decisions on the \\ndesign and implementation of local adaptation \\nmeasures.\\n\\n•\\t intergovernmental relations – Provinces negotiate \\nagreements, collaborate on programs and projects, \\nand manage their relations with other provinces \\nand the federal government. In that capacity, a \\nprovince can help set the conditions for participation \\nby local governments in programs that support or \\ncomplement adaptation. An example is the set of \\nagreements between the Government of Canada and \\nvarious provinces governing the allocation of federal \\ngas-tax funds. \\n\\nThe nature and extent of provincial involvement in local \\nadaptation planning varies between provinces, depending \\non legal and institutional frameworks, the planning culture \\nand practice of each location, and many other factors.\\n\\nTERRITORIES\\n\\nLike provincial governments, the governments of the \\nterritories of Nunavut, the Northwest Territories and \\nYukon have jurisdiction over land use planning and many \\nother local matters. However, these legislative powers do \\nnot spring directly from the Constitution but instead are \\ndelegated to the territories by the Government of Canada \\nunder various laws.89,90,91 Territorial governments in turn \\nenact legislation and adopt policies to guide planning by \\nlocal and regional authorities within their borders.92,93\\n\\n\\n\\nL A N D  U S E  P L A N N I N G  T O O L S  |  31 \\n\\nWhile the legal framework for land use planning in the \\nterritories differs from that in the provinces, the roles \\nthat territorial governments play in adaptation to climate \\nchange roughly correspond to those described in the \\nProvinces section of this appendix. For example, territorial \\n\\ngovernments also adopt climate change strategies and \\nactions plans.94,95,96 Territorial land-use planning practices \\nand territorial government involvement in local adaptation \\nplanning vary by territory, depending on the enabling \\nfederal legislation and other factors.\\n\\nBritish Columbia’s Climate Action Plan97\\n\\nBritish Columbia released its Climate Action Plan in June 2008. Chapter 5 describes the Province’s vision, strategies \\nand activities as it prepares for climate change. In responding to the increased likelihood of severe weather events, \\nthe provincial government is taking action to (1) ensure that new development on flood plains will be flood-proofed \\nto provincial standards, (2) consider the impacts of climate change when awarding provincial infrastructure grants, \\n(3) develop a comprehensive plan for green community development and (4) ensure that community development \\nstrategies recognize the importance of streams and rivers. The Province is currently updating its planning policy \\nstatements and guidelines, including the Guidelines for Management of Coastal Flood Hazard Land Use. The \\nGuidelines describe new land use tools that local governments may adopt, including sea level rise planning areas and \\nrisk-based zoning.98 \\n\\nPrince Edward Island’s Climate Change Strategy99\\n\\nPrince Edward Island’s Climate Change Strategy outlines measures to both reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to \\ndeal with the impacts of climate change. The strategy adopts a risk-based approach to adaptation as it “is the most \\npractical way to ensure that adaptation responses are socially acceptable, cost-effective and consistent with the \\ncommunity’s wider social, environmental and economic goals.” The impacts of climate change on coasts – such as sea \\nlevel rise, increased storm surge flooding and erosion – are highlighted as issues of concern. The strategy identifies \\nfive overarching adaptation objectives and actions, all of which have direct implications at the municipal level. For \\nexample, the Province committed to reviewing all provincial land use and development policies to encourage more \\nsustainable options for future land development and to better adapt to changing climate conditions.\\n\\nManitoba’s Provincial Planning Regulation \\nManitoba’s Provincial Planning Regulation100 (the Regulation) identifies both climate change mitigation and adaptation \\nas strategic priorities, along with other key concerns such as clean water and public safety. Community resilience is \\nrecognized as a key principle of sound land use planning. \\n\\nThe Regulation identifies issues of provincial interest to be addressed in local development plans and goals to be \\npursued in various policy areas. For instance, with respect to general development policy, the provincial interest \\nincludes directing development toward areas where risk can be minimized and taking into account climate change \\nvulnerabilities. With regard to water, provincial interest includes the development of strategies to prioritize allocation \\nand implementation of conservation measures to build community resilience. The Regulation prohibits certain kinds of \\ndevelopment in or near water bodies and prescribes minimum setbacks for new development. The policy on planning \\nfor agriculture recognizes the potential increased demand for food production in response to climate change and \\nencourages local authorities to promote food security. At a strategic level, the Regulation requires that each local \\nplanning authority assess local vulnerabilities to climate change and consider existing climate change action plans \\nwhen preparing, amending or replacing the local development plan. \\n\\n\\n\\n32 |  L A N D  U S E  P L A N N I N G  T O O L S\\n\\nAppendix B \\nAdditional resources on select decision-support tools\\n\\nVISUALIZING CLIMATE \\nCHANGE\\xa0IMPACTS\\n\\nLocal Climate Change Visioning and Landscape \\nVisualizations: Guidance Manual (2010). \\n\\nThis manual, published by the Centre for Advanced \\nLandscape Planning at the University of British Columbia, \\nassists communities in developing climate change visioning \\nprocesses. \\n\\nhttp://www.calp.forestry.ubc.ca/news/viz-guidance-manual/\\n\\nADAPTATION PLANNING GUIDANCE\\n\\nClimate Change Adaptation Planning: A Handbook \\nfor Small Canadian Communities (Canadian Institute \\nof Planners, 2011)\\n\\nThe handbook helps small Canadian communities prepare \\nand implement a climate change adaptation plan.

It involves \\nmaking adjustments in our decisions, activities and \\nthinking because of observed or expected changes \\nin climate.2 Some ways municipalities act \\n•  planning and land use controls: zoning, official  plans, development reviews •  provision of public services: utilities, public \\ntransit, road maintenance, snow removal, fire \\nand police, emergency preparedness •  forum for public dialogue and information: \\npublic awareness campaigns, deliberation \\non bylaws and programs, information on \\ncity\\xa0services •  collection of taxes and user fees: property \\ntaxes, recreational facility fees, parking fees  •  management of public land and buildings: \\nestablishment of parks, renovation of civic \\nbuildings, operation of water treatment plants Canada’s climate is changing rapidly. Although all levels \\nof government have important roles to play to advance \\nadaptation, action at the local level is particularly important \\nbecause that is where many of the impacts of climate \\nchange will be felt most directly.1 Local governments in Canada can manage the risks and \\nopportunities presented by climate through a variety \\nof practices, including adoption and enforcement of \\nbylaws; collection of taxes and user fees; operation of \\ntransportation, utilities and other public infrastructure; \\nestablishment of subsidies, tax credits and other incentive \\nprograms; administration of emergency management \\nand response systems; and public outreach and \\neducation\\xa0initiatives. Land use planning is one of the most effective processes \\nto facilitate local adaptation to climate change.3,4 \\nHistorically, local governments have used land use planning \\ntools – official plans, zoning, development permits and \\nothers – to minimize risks to communities from floods, \\nwildfires, landslides and other natural hazards.5 As the \\nclimate changes, so will the frequency and magnitude of \\nclimate-related hazards, posing a challenge for community \\nplanners. A recent survey by the Canadian Institute of \\nPlanners confirmed that “planners gravitate to tools they \\nknow best and are looking for ways to adapt known tools \\nwhen addressing climate change.”6  P\\nH O\\nT O\\n C O\\nU R\\nT E\\nS Y\\n O F\\n J E\\nR R\\nY  M\\nO U\\nL A\\nN D  2 |  L A N D  U S E  P L A N N I N G  T O O L S2 |  L A N D  U S E  P L A N N I N G  T O O L S Planning tools and climate change \\nrisk reduction \\nGenerally speaking, planning tools can be used to \\nreduce climate risks in four ways: •  limiting development in hazard-prone areas •  ensuring that the built environment can \\nwithstand a range of environmental stress •  helping to preserve natural environments \\nthat protect communities against hazards \\n(for example, dunes that absorb coastal \\nstorm\\xa0effects)  •  educating stakeholders and decision makers \\nabout risks and opportunities and fostering \\ndialogue about adaptation This document describes tools in the land use planning \\nsector that communities can use in preparing to adapt to \\nclimate change. In addition, it provides information on \\ndecision-support tools, tools that provide information and \\nresources to help planners and local decision makers take \\neffective adaptation action.  A brief example of each tool and its use by a Canadian \\ncommunity is given. Not every case discussed here was \\nexplicitly motivated by a desire to adapt to climate change. \\nHowever, the significance of the tool to adaptation \\nplanning is clear in each case. An effort was made to select \\nexamples from communities of varying sizes and from all \\nregions of Canada.   Although the examples are of broad utility, the design and \\napplication of a particular planning tool can vary greatly \\nfrom one jurisdiction to another, depending on provincial \\nor territorial laws and other factors. We describe the \\nprovincial and territorial roles in local adaptation planning \\nin Appendix A. Readers interested in knowing how a \\nparticular tool is applied in a specific community should \\nconsult provincial, territorial and local laws. It is important to keep in mind that land use planning is \\nused to pursue many local policy objectives, including \\nproviding affordable housing, stimulating job growth, \\npreserving the character and heritage of a community, \\nreducing greenhouse gas emissions, protecting biodiversity \\nand enabling efficient transportation. A key challenge for \\nplanners and local decision makers is how to incorporate \\nand balance the need to prepare for climate change \\nthrough adaptation with other local development \\nobjectives. Another consideration is how to integrate \\n(mainstream) consideration of changing climate into \\nthe wide array of decisions made by local governments, \\nfrom operating municipal services to capital spending, \\nenforcement and inspection activities, collection of taxes, \\nand administration of disaster response programs.

Land use planning refers to the processes and instruments \\nemployed to manage the use of land and the physical \\ndevelopment of a community for the common interest.  A variety of statutory and other measures – bylaws, \\nincentives, information and guidance, spending programs\\xa0– \\nmay be applied to control how land is used. The scale of \\naction is usually the neighbourhood, a whole town or city \\nor a metropolitan area. Tools for the regulation of individual \\nbuildings, such as building codes, green building standards, \\nproperty taxes and the like, are closely related to land use \\nplanning but are not covered in this document.  2.0 Land use planning tools  4 |  L A N D  U S E  P L A N N I N G  T O O L S P\\nH O\\nT O\\n C O\\nU R\\nT E\\nS Y\\n O F\\n J E\\nR R\\nY  M\\nO U\\nL A\\nN D\\nP H\\nO T\\nO  C\\nO U\\nR T\\nE S\\nY  O\\nF  J\\nE R\\nR Y\\n M O\\nU L\\nA N\\nD 2.1 OFFICIAL PLANS\\nAn official plan is a formal planning document, often \\nrequired by provincial law, that sets out a comprehensive \\nlong-term vision and the goals and objectives for the \\ndevelopment of a community.7 Preparing such a plan \\ntypically begins with expert analyses of local conditions \\nand includes public consultations as well as reviews by local \\nadvisory committees and provincial and other authorities. \\nAfter the plan is finalized, the local council adopts it \\nformally by enacting a bylaw. Provincial approval may be \\nrequired as well.  Also entitled general, community or master plans, these \\ndocuments identify the major social, economic and \\nenvironmental challenges facing the community and \\narticulate strategies to address them. Official plans are \\nin force for a relatively long period (10 years or longer) \\nwith updates required periodically (every five years in \\nsome provinces). They may designate some areas of the \\ncommunity as appropriate locations for new growth  Iqaluit’s General Plan8 Iqaluit (population 6200), the capital of Nunavut, is one of the first Canadian communities to integrate climate \\nchange adaptation into its General Plan. One of the five priority vision statements identifies Iqaluit as “a community \\nthat adapts to climate change.” The plan sets out two high-level objectives to realize this vision: (1) to study the \\nimpacts of climate change on the community and (2) to adopt policies that recognize the long-term impacts of \\nclimate change. The plan includes more detail on the climate change issues of concern to the community (for \\nexample, increases in temperature and precipitation, permafrost thaw, decreases in sea ice, and accelerated coastal \\nerosion) and priority adaptation actions related to municipal infrastructure.

Official \\nplans serve as guiding documents for subsequent local \\npolicies, programs and bylaws (such as zoning codes and \\nsubdivision\\xa0controls). Climate change adaptation can be incorporated directly \\ninto a municipality’s official plan, either in a dedicated \\nsection or embedded throughout the document. Such \\ntexts normally detail local climate change risks and \\nopportunities, an overarching adaptation vision and policy, \\nas well as priority adaptation needs. Adaptation strategies \\nand actions in official plans include mainstreaming \\nadaptation into all or selected municipal operations, \\nundertaking a comprehensive municipal risk assessment \\nprocess to prioritize risks and opportunities, developing \\na comprehensive municipal adaptation action plan, or \\nobtaining critical information or technical data for making \\neffective and appropriate adaptation decisions.   L A N D  U S E  P L A N N I N G  T O O L S  |  5  Elkford’s Official Community Plan9,10 The District of Elkford is a small community (population 2500) in the Rocky Mountains of southeastern British \\nColumbia. Historically, Elkford has dealt with several climate-related hazards, including flooding, drought and \\nwildfires. A changing climate magnifies all these risks. In 2008, Elkford, with support of the Columbia Basin Trust, \\na provincial crown corporation, developed a local adaptation strategy to assess the risks posed by climate change \\nand identify corresponding adaptation actions. The Adaptation Strategy was developed concurrently with a revision \\nto Elkford’s Official Community Plan (OCP), allowing the two to be fully integrated. Consideration of climate \\nchange in all decision making is one of the OCP’s 11 guiding principles. Adaptation actions in the OCP include \\na wildfire protection zone in which any development application must be accompanied by a fire hazard and risk \\nassessment conducted by certified professionals before a permit is issued. The OCP also calls for the development \\nof a community evacuation plan in the event of an extreme wildfire or flooding.

Those plans may focus on one \\nfunction of local government (such as public transit or \\nstorm water management), on a sector or issue of special \\nsignificance to the community (such as the development \\nof the arts or the needs of senior citizens) or on a \\nneighbourhood with special planning needs.11 As with \\nofficial plans, these local plans are often developed through \\na formal planning process, including public consultation, \\nand provide an assessment of conditions, a long-term vision \\nand a set of goals and actions for the particular issue or \\narea in question.  A growing number of Canadian municipalities have \\nadopted plans that specifically address the need to adapt to \\nclimate change. Some communities have chosen to develop \\nstand-alone adaptation plans. Those documents typically \\noutline the climate change impacts of concern to the \\ncommunity, the associated risks and opportunities, and the \\ncommunity’s vision and proposed actions for dealing with \\nthose changes. Many other communities have integrated \\nconsideration of climate change adaptation into local plans \\nthat address other issues. For example, a municipality may \\nintegrate adaptation into its capital improvement plan for \\nstorm water sewer systems. Stratford’s Climate Change Adaptation Plan12 The Town of Stratford (population 8046), a rapidly growing community in Prince Edward Island, is located on a \\npeninsula just south of the provincial capital, Charlottetown. The main climate change issues of concern to the \\ncommunity are coastal erosion, which already threatens several important heritage buildings and homes, sea level \\nrise, storm surge and inland flooding.  In 2010, the Town, in partnership with the Canadian Institute of Planners and the Atlantic Planners Institute, \\ncreated a long-term strategic plan to prepare Stratford for climate change. The process comprised four stages: \\n(1) forming a core working group to establish overarching objectives, engage key stakeholders and conduct \\nbackground research into local climate change impacts; (2) organizing public meetings to assess current and future \\nvulnerabilities (following a presentation of the potential climate change impacts, a survey was distributed to all \\nparticipants at the public meeting to gauge climate change-related opportunities and threats for the community); \\n(3) conducting a risk assessment, building on results of the vulnerability assessment, to rank the most important \\nclimate change impacts and identify priority areas for adaptation action; and (4) preparing a final adaptation plan \\nthat included recommended adaptation actions by theme (for example, heritage properties, parks and recreation, \\nprivate properties, emergency services, storm water infrastructure). Stratford has since integrated adaptation \\nconsiderations into all new or updated community action plans, including its draft Official Plan, Strategic Plan and \\nMaster Stormwater Management Plan.

The city’s urban tree \\ncanopy is seriously threatened by drought, \\ninsect infestations, disease, storms and climate \\nchange. These threats spurred Edmonton to \\ncreate the Urban Forest Management Plan \\n(UFMP) to guide the management of the tree \\ncanopy over a 10-year period. The UFMP \\nincludes developing an inventory of the urban \\nforest (completed 2009), a review of existing \\nplanting strategies, a communication plan and \\npotential tree planting partnerships. Many \\nof these actions will increase resilience to \\ndrought conditions, which may be exacerbated \\nby climate change. For example, Edmonton’s \\nForestry Unit is testing the use of different tree \\nspecies, such as red maples, and alternative \\ntree watering techniques.  imagineCALGARY14 Calgary (population 1 096 833) is situated in southern Alberta. The impact of climate change on water quality and \\nquantity is of particular concern in the area. Local rivers are expected to experience decreased flow because of \\ndecreased precipitation and reduced glacial coverage in the headwaters of the river basins.15 imagineCALGARY was \\na community visioning and consultation process undertaken in 2005 to produce a 100-year roadmap for Calgary’s \\ndevelopment. The process engaged more than 18 000 Calgarians representing businesses, community agencies, \\nnon-profits and governments as well as the public. Calgary is one of the first communities in Canada to consider \\nclimate change in its long-range planning. The City commissioned scoping reports to investigate how four major \\ntrends might impact the city: demographic changes, resource scarcity, technology transformation and climate \\nchange. Since publishing the imagineCALGARY plan in 2007, the City has implemented its vision and targets in \\nsubsequent land use plans and strategies. Numerous local partner organizations in the private, non-profit and \\npublic sectors have also committed to achieving the vision by changing their policies and practices.

Zoning bylaws divide \\nthe entire community into zones. For each zone, only \\ncertain land uses are permitted (for example, commercial, \\nresidential, industrial). In addition to restrictions on the \\nuse of the property, the zoning bylaws may impose \\nrequirements on buildings, including maximum height, \\nlot coverage and density, as well as building type and \\nsetbacks. Those requirements are reflected in a zoning \\nmap for the jurisdiction. Zoning restrictions usually apply \\nonly\\xa0prospectively.19 Zoning codes can be used by municipalities to limit new \\ndevelopment in hazard-prone areas (for instance in areas \\nsubject to wildfires, landslides or coastal erosion) or to \\nprescribe building standards that reduce vulnerability to \\nenvironmental stress.20,21 For example, in areas of high \\nflood risk, all development may be prohibited, while in \\nareas where the risk is lower, the ground floor of new \\nbuildings and structures may be required to be built \\nabove a minimum height to avoid flood damage.22 Given \\nthat climate change often magnifies existing hazard risk, \\nmunicipalities could respond by modifying existing zoning \\nrestrictions to factor in the greater intensity, frequency or \\nduration of certain hazards as climate changes. Beaubassin-est’s sea level rise protection zone23 Beaubassin-est (population 6200), a small coastal community in southeast New Brunswick, is vulnerable to \\nthe impacts of sea level rise and storm surge flooding. The Community is one of the first in New Brunswick \\nto implement a minimum height standard for buildings to address climate change impacts. Council passed an \\nupdated zoning bylaw in March 2011 to better protect new construction in the community’s coastal zone.  The bylaw identifies a sea level rise “protection zone” in which the minimum ground floor elevation of any new \\nbuilding must be at least 1.43 metres above the current 1-in-100-year flood mark. The regulation is an overlay \\nzone\\xa0– all previous zoning conditions apply. Rather than restrict development outright, the zoning bylaw imposes \\nstricter building requirements on developers. This new regulation provides an opportunity to educate developers \\nas well as the community at large about the impacts of climate change and sea level rise. This update to the bylaw \\nwas based on the best available scientific understanding of sea level rise for the area and a high resolution digital \\nmap that the community commissioned to help identify potential flood levels.

The urban heat island effect is pronounced in many parts of the borough. Urban heat islands are areas in \\ncities where ambient air temperatures tend to be hotter than in surrounding areas. They occur where there is little \\nvegetation and a high percentage of dark surfaces, such as tar roofs, asphalt roads and parking lots.  In April 2011, the borough council revised its comprehensive zoning bylaw to include four regulatory measures \\naimed at tackling urban heat islands: (1) when replacing an existing roof or constructing a new building, the owner \\nmust install either a green roof or a highly reflective roof; (2) for all new parking lots of 10 or more spaces, at least \\n15 percent of the area must be open ground landscaped with plants, bushes and trees; (3) all new paving materials \\nmust meet a minimum specified surface reflectivity rating; and (4) when constructing a new building, at least \\n20\\xa0percent of the building site must remain open ground and be landscaped with plants, bushes and trees.  These four measures apply to all public and private property throughout the borough. More than 300 permits for \\nreflective roofs were issued in the first year after the bylaw was passed.

The \\ncontrols, which may apply to subdivisions of land, new \\nconstruction or alterations to existing buildings, allow local \\nofficials to evaluate projects case by case.7 Among them are •  subdivision controls – which apply when a developer \\nwants to divide a parcel of land, often for residential \\ndevelopment. Generally, subdivision plans must \\ndemonstrate good access and efficient utility service \\nfor all the proposed lots and also address concerns \\nabout financial, environmental and other\\xa0impacts. •  site plan controls, development permits, \\ndevelopment agreements and similar tools – \\nwhich require developers to submit detailed designs \\nto be assessed against specified criteria. For example, \\na proposal may be reviewed for the quality of the \\ndesign of public areas, the fit with the historic \\ncharacter of the neighbourhood, or the extent of \\ndisturbance to ecologically sensitive land. •  comprehensive development zones, planned \\nunit developments and similar instruments – \\nthat apply to large sites in which non-standard or \\ninnovative designs and techniques are to be used, \\nand a customised approach to zoning and site design \\nis appropriate. As part of the evaluation of proposals under these types \\nof regulations, local officials may seek changes to projects \\nprior to approval. Further, the developer may be required to \\npay development charges, dedicate a portion of the site for \\npublic use or provide some other concession or amenity. These project-based, discretionary development controls \\ncan be very useful for adapting to climate change at the \\nneighbourhood scale. For example, as part of the review \\nof a subdivision proposal, the developer may be asked to \\nassess the increased risk of erosion due to climate change \\nand to determine how it may affect the development. \\nThe municipality may require that appropriate adaptation \\nmeasures be taken by the developer, such as shoreline \\nrestoration or increased development setbacks. The lots \\nin a proposed subdivision may be clustered in the least \\nhazardous part of the property. In other cases, a site plan \\ncontrol ordinance may be used to require that green design \\nfeatures that address the impacts of climate change be \\nincorporated (for instance, providing shade and rooftop \\ngardens to decrease the public health risk from urban \\nheat\\xa0islands).  Toronto’s Green Standard\\nToronto, Ontario (population 2.6 million), is situated at the centre \\nof a conurbation of more than 5 million people. Climate change \\nimpacts of concern for the city include increased health risks due \\nto extreme heat, higher incidence of pests and diseases (such as \\nWest Nile virus) and more extreme rainfall with consequences for \\nstorm-water systems and other infrastructure.26 The Toronto Green Standard (TGS) is a set of performance \\nmeasures for site and building design, covering energy and water \\nefficiency, air and water quality, ecological services and solid waste \\nmanagement. The standards work with the regular development \\napproval and inspection process, and apply to all new development subject to subdivision or site plan controls or \\nfor which a zoning amendment is required.27 Although adaptation is not explicitly mentioned, the TGS addresses \\nseveral climate change impacts of concern to the city. For example, one provision, applicable to non-residential \\ndevelopment of three stories or less, requires the use of light-coloured materials, open-grid pavement or shading \\non at least 50 percent of the site to reduce urban heat. Another provision requires that new developments retain at \\nleast the first 5 millimetres (mm) from each rainfall through rainwater reuse, plantings and other practices, thereby \\nreducing storm water runoff. A more stringent set of voluntary standards has been adopted. Developments that \\nmeet those stricter standards are eligible for reductions in development fees.

Climate change, which is expected to bring more frequent storms to the \\narea, will likely increase the vulnerability of coastal development and infrastructure.28 Various community plans, \\nincluding the 2006 HRM Regional Plan, already call for new developments to be constructed a minimum height \\nabove the ordinary high-water mark.29  One flexible mechanism that planners in Halifax use to address coastal threats is development agreements. Certain \\nareas of the community are designated as zones where review and approval of development projects proceed \\nthrough negotiation. Local bylaws specify in general terms the matters to be considered in such negotiations, \\ngiving planners latitude to address a broad range of issues regarding environmental protection, natural hazards \\nand other concerns.30 The developer may be asked to produce relevant information (such as the impacts of \\nwave-run up on a particular property) and to consider and adopt appropriate hazard mitigation strategies. In a \\nrecent development in downtown Dartmouth (an HRM municipality), local officials and the developer agreed to \\nestablish minimum elevations for a new marina and other seaside structures that were several metres higher than \\nprovided in area plans. This was consistent both with the developer’s interest in protecting the property and the \\ncommunity’s interest in minimizing risk. The development agreement process enabled planners and developers to \\nexchange information on storm surge and wave run up on this site, and to produce a more resilient project design.

An easement may allow the \\npublic to pass through private land to reach a beach. Both \\ncovenants and easements are said to “run with the land,” \\nwhich means they bind current as well as future owners. \\nThere are strict and complex legal requirements that apply \\nwhen creating easements or covenants.  Covenants may serve local planning goals in different ways:  •  as a development control tool – Municipalities \\nmay use covenants when entering development \\nagreements, applying controls on subdivisions and \\nother development projects or imposing conditions \\non issuing a development permit. In such cases, \\nthese instruments ensure that community interests \\nare protected and that the developer’s promises \\nabout the operation and maintenance of the \\nproperty are enforceable long after construction. \\nCovenants may be used in “green developments” \\nthat use innovative energy, waste water treatment \\nand other systems that require public access and the \\ncollaboration of future owners for proper operation \\nand maintenance.33 •  as a conservation tool – A special form of \\ncovenant, known as a conservation covenant or \\neasement has been established by law in many \\nprovinces. It places restrictions on the use of land to \\nprotect its natural values. For example, a conservation \\ncovenant may prohibit the removal of native \\nvegetation and prohibit any structures on a portion \\nof the property that contains sensitive ecosystems. \\nThe owner who enters into a conservation covenant \\ncontinues to own the land and may live on it, sell it, \\nor pass it on to heirs but the covenant’s restrictions \\non development are followed in the future, regardless \\nof who owns the land.34 In exchange, the land owner \\nmay be eligible for tax reductions or credits. Covenants and easements can play an important role \\nin climate change adaptation planning. For example, \\na municipality may acquire a conservation easement \\nto prevent residential development on a coastal area \\nthreatened by sea level rise and storm surge flooding.  \\nA covenant may be negotiated with owners in an area to \\nprevent construction of docks, sea walls or other coastal \\nprotection structures in order to allow marshes and dunes \\nto migrate inland naturally.35 Covenants and easements may \\nalso support local efforts to monitor climate change by, for \\nexample, allowing access to a coastal property for purposes \\nof measuring erosion rates.  Island Trust’s NAPTEP Covenant\\nThe Islands Trust (population 25 000) is a federation of local governments \\nin the Gulf Islands and Howe Sound islands of British Columbia. The Islands \\nTrust Fund acts as the conservation arm of the federation, charged with \\nprotecting the ecosystems in the region through land acquisition, conservation \\ncovenants and education programs. Since 1990, it has protected more than \\n1073\\xa0hectares (ha) of land on 84 properties.36  Adaptation to climate change, especially the protection of biodiversity, is one \\nkey concern of the Trust Fund. The effects of changing climate are already \\nevident in local ecosystems: vegetation is experiencing earlier green-up, \\nwildlife migration patterns are changing, and insect outbreaks are more \\ncommon.37 Up to 30 percent of assessed animal species are believed to be \\nat high risk of extirpation (local extinction).38 By establishing, monitoring and \\nmanaging conservation areas, the Trust Fund aims to maintain the ecological \\nfunctions of high biodiversity areas in the face of a changing climate. Under \\nthe Trust Fund’s Natural Area Protection Tax Exemption Program (NAPTEP) \\nCovenant, land owners receive a 65 percent reduction in property taxes on \\nthe protected portion of their land. The Trust Fund is developing a tool to \\nestimate the biodiversity value of properties to prioritize future acquisitions.

Wildfires are one of several risks projected to increase as a result \\nof changing climate. In the summer of 2003, three large wildfires reached the city’s perimeter, threatening homes \\nand infrastructure. They increased local awareness and concern about the impacts of wildfires on the community. Covenants are one of a suite of tools the City uses in its efforts to reduce wildfire risk.39 In 1992, the City instituted \\na policy specifying that, as a condition of subdivision approval, all new subdivisions within hazardous zones must \\nregister a restrictive covenant.40 Under such a covenant, developers and home owners are bound to undertake \\nactions to reduce fire risks, including maintaining fuel-buffer zones around homes; controlling roofing materials \\nand installation of wooden shacks and shingles; screening of all eaves, attics, decks and openings under floors \\nto prevent the accumulation of flammable material; and installing approved spark arresters in all wood stoves. All \\nsubdivisions constructed since 1992 in high to extreme wildfire hazard areas have registered restrictive wildfire \\ncovenants. Kamloops is revising the 1992 covenant to improve clarity and ensure it conforms to the City’s latest fire \\nhazard assessment mapping.

Municipalities may develop design guidelines \\nfor several reasons: to improve environmental performance, \\nreduce infrastructure costs, enhance aesthetics, increase \\npublic safety or create more accessible public spaces. \\nExamples include guidelines for the design of parking lots, \\nstreetscapes, building facades, storm water ponds, heritage \\ndistricts and public squares. A combination of text and \\nphotographs, sketches and architectural drawings describe \\npreferred designs.  Municipalities often develop these publications as \\nsupplementary educational tools to help developers, design \\nprofessionals (such as architects, landscape architects, \\nengineers and planners) or the general public to improve \\nupon existing design and construction practices. They \\nalso illustrate various ways in which developers may meet \\nrequired municipal or provincial development standards.  Some municipalities require that developers comply with \\nsuch design guidelines and demonstrate compliance during \\nthe formal review of development proposals. The design of a community’s physical components – such \\nas parking lots, parks and roadways, drainage ditches or \\na neighbourhood as a whole – can reduce or magnify \\nthe impacts of climate change at the local scale.41,42 \\nGood design can contribute to building resilience to \\nclimate change at the local level.43 For example, selecting \\nappropriate building materials and landscaping can reduce \\nthe risk of wildfires. Although many municipalities have \\ndeveloped design guidelines without climate change in \\nmind, their use can improve resilience to the impacts \\nof climate change. Conversely, design guidelines may \\nrecommend or impose development standards that may \\ninadvertently decrease resilience to climate change. For \\nexample, a municipality may prescribe building wide roads \\nto accommodate emergency vehicles. However, those wide \\nroads may also increase storm water volumes and magnify \\nthe urban heat island effect. Regina’s Xeriscape Workbook44 Regina, Saskatchewan (population 193 100), is situated in the middle of the southern prairies, the driest major \\nregion of Canada. The city has very little local access to water. For the Canadian prairies, increases in water scarcity \\nand drought are one of the most serious risks presented by climate change.  Xeriscape is an alternate form of landscaping that relies on drought-tolerant plants to reduce outdoor watering \\nrequirements during the summer. In 1993, the City of Regina produced the Xeriscape Workbook, which provides \\npractical guidelines for low-water, low-maintenance landscaping. The Workbook is distributed at free workshops in \\nthe spring and fall and on the  \\nCity’s Web site. In the late 1990s,  \\nthe City partnered with a local school \\nto create a xeriscape educational \\nand demonstration site. The garden \\nfeatures 45 plant types, a false creek \\nand an amphitheatre with a teacher’s \\nrock for outdoor classes and lessons. \\nClimate change was not a consideration \\nwhen the City first developed the \\nWorkbook. However, the application \\nof the landscaping practices within \\nthe Workbook helps reduce water \\nconsumption, an important climate \\nchange adaptation\\xa0action.

Traditionally, parking lot design \\nhas been based mainly on functional criteria (to maximize parking lot spaces and minimize maintenance costs) \\nwith little regard to the quality of the urban design or environmental performance. The new guidelines provide \\ndesign options and strategies, in both graphic and written form, to meet the following objectives: enhance the \\nsafety and attractiveness of the public realm, provide shade and high-quality landscaping, reduce the urban \\nheat island effect, manage storm-water quality and quantity on-site, and incorporate sustainable material and \\ntechnologies. All proposals for new parking lots within city limits, both public and private, must consider the \\nguidelines before receiving development approval. The guidelines also help developers comply with the Toronto \\nGreen Standard. Although not designed explicitly as a climate change adaptation measure, the application of the \\nguidelines, particularly the urban heat island and storm-water management measures, increase the city’s resilience \\nto climate\\xa0change.

Climate change in this region is expected to cause a rise in \\ncoastal water levels, more intense precipitation and storm events, and more significant coastal and inland erosion \\nand\\xa0flooding.48 The Saint John Waterfront Development Corporation, on behalf of the City, plans to redevelop 2.43 ha of land \\non the waterfront. The street grid is to be extended, buildings renovated and new residences, shops and a hotel \\nconstructed. A portion of the development site was formerly a Canadian Coast Guard base and is owned by \\nFisheries and Oceans Canada. Accordingly, the transfer of the property to the Corporation requires a screening \\nunder the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act.49 The EA screening, completed in March of 2010, included \\nconsideration of the potential impacts of climate change and sea level rise on the project.50 The Corporation \\nagreed to ensure that the climate and potential sea level rise are considered where relevant in the design of the \\ninfrastructure components of the project. The loadings and stresses associated with climate change, potential sea \\nlevel rise and other environmental forces are to be addressed through engineering design as the planning for the \\nproject continues.

It can be applied \\nto a specific project, such as the construction of a bridge \\nor to a plan or policy intended to guide future projects. \\nMany kinds of developments are required to undergo \\nan EA. For instance, federal and provincial law may \\nrequire EAs for major industrial projects, projects that use \\nfederal or provincial funds or for development on crown \\nlands.46 Some municipal infrastructure projects such as \\nextensions of sewers and the construction of water mains, \\nroads and transit systems may be subject to provincial \\nEA requirements. In 2003, the Canadian Environmental \\nAssessment Agency issued guidelines for incorporating \\nclimate change considerations in EAs, one of the first \\nfederal agencies in the world to do so.47  In addition, municipalities can require formal environmental \\nreviews, sometimes called environmental impact studies \\n(EISs), as part of the local process for the evaluation of  development proposals. For example, developers may be \\nrequired to submit an EIS for plans of a subdivision or for \\na building project located in or near sensitive or protected \\nareas. The scope and process for a particular EIS will \\nvary depending on the nature of the project, applicable \\nenvironmental and planning laws, policies in the official \\ncommunity plan and municipal bylaws, and the resources \\navailable to local authorities.  EAs, EISs and other forms of environmental review have \\nproven to be ready platforms for consideration of climate \\nchange concerns. The applicable legislation and guidelines \\nfor EAs and EISs may require that local climate change be \\nincorporated as one aspect of the natural environment to \\nbe considered and that measures to address climate change \\nimpacts be incorporated into the project’s design and \\nmanagement plan. In other cases, climate change impacts \\nmay not be a direct consideration in the EA process. \\nDespite this, measures enacted in response to the EA may \\nhelp build resilience to a changing climate.

Climate change is expected to \\nbring Ajax more frequent and more severe extreme weather. This, plus proposed urbanization in the region, could \\nincrease local risks such as flooding, fouled beaches and decreased water quality in Lake Ontario, the primary \\nsource of water for Ajax.51  Ajax proactively uses EAs and EISs in its efforts to address climate change concerns. For example, to improve the \\nquality of water discharged into Lake Ontario, Ajax is developing a master plan for the retrofit of its storm-water \\nsystem. As part of that process, the Town conducted a Municipal Engineers Class EA to evaluate various retrofit \\nmeasures.52 The EA recommended a two-stage action plan involving (1) adopting “Healthy Community Practices,” \\nsuch as more strategic street sweeping practices, low-impact development approaches, community education \\nprograms and ongoing storm-water quality monitoring; and (2) using results from the monitoring program to \\ndetermine whether engineered measures, such as retrofits to sewers, trenches and channel expansions, are needed.  Further, pursuant to environmental and climate change adaptation policies in its Official Plan, Ajax requires that \\nan EIS be submitted with all applications for developments on land designated as a natural heritage or hydrologic \\nfeatures of provincial, regional or local significance. The EIS must evaluate adverse impacts of the proposed \\ndevelopment and establish appropriate actions to address those impacts.

Recommended criteria for decision making (for example, \\nno-regrets, win-win, the precautionary principle, \\nreversible strategies)54 and techniques for appraising \\nadaptation options (for example, cost-benefit analysis, cost \\neffectiveness, multicriteria analysis),55 although important in \\nthe adaptation process, are not discussed in this document.  L A N D  U S E  P L A N N I N G  T O O L S  |  19  One of the first steps in the local adaptation planning \\nprocess is an assessment of how climate change affects \\na community. Assessments can take several forms.i Some \\nemphasize projections of climate change impacts in \\nthe community, while others focus on the factors that \\nproduce local vulnerability and constrain the ability of the \\ncommunity to take adaptive actions. The knowledge gained \\nthrough vulnerability and risk assessments can help decision \\nmakers develop effective adaptation measures.  Many guidelines and frameworks have been developed \\nto help communities undertake local climate change \\nassessments.57 Some are generic tools that may apply \\ngenerally to all communities, while others are targeted \\nto certain types of communities (for example, rural \\ncommunities) or particular forms of climate change impacts \\n(for example, heat-related health risks). Many forms of \\nknowledge, including scientific and technical expertise and \\nlocal and traditional knowledge, can contribute to local \\nassessments of climate change impacts and adaptation.  VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENTS  A vulnerability assessment is a structured process for \\nidentifying the vulnerability of human and natural systems \\nto climate change.58 The more exposed and sensitive an \\nindividual or community is to climate change, the higher \\nits vulnerability. Vulnerability is also a function of adaptive \\ncapacity; the higher a community’s capacity to undertake \\nadaptive actions, the less vulnerable it is.  When conducting a vulnerability assessment, a broad \\nrange of socio-economic and physical factors should be \\nconsidered, including climate conditions, the adequacy of \\nhousing and local infrastructure, the quality of emergency \\nresponse systems and assistance networks, the availability  P\\nH O\\nT O\\n C O\\nU R\\nT E\\nS Y\\n O F\\n J E\\nR R\\nY  M\\nO U\\nL A\\nN D i The IPCC56 described several distinct conceptual frameworks for assessments of local climate change, including impact-based approaches that are climate scenario driven, adaptation-based \\napproaches that focus on the capacity of communities and natural systems to respond effectively to stress, vulnerability-based approaches centered on the factors driving the susceptibility \\nof individuals and groups to harm, integrated approaches that include modelling and other procedures for investigating climate change across sectors and scales and risk management \\napproaches that focus directly on decision making. of material and financial resources, and the general health \\nand risk awareness of the population.59,60 Consultation with \\nlocal stakeholders and residents is crucial in assessments, \\nboth to understand existing vulnerabilities and to develop \\neffective strategies to reduce them. The information gained \\nfrom vulnerability assessments allows local officials to \\ndevelop appropriate interventions such as improved health \\nservices, better access to transportation networks, and \\nhealthier buildings and urban spaces. The assessments also \\nhelp to prioritize measures to assist the most vulnerable \\nindividuals and groups in a timely and cost-effective manner.  RISK MANAGEMENT Risk management is a process widely used by businesses, \\ngovernments and non-governmental organizations to \\nidentify and manage the adverse impacts of a change \\nin conditions. The magnitude of a risk is calculated by \\nexamining the probability of the occurrence of an event and \\nthe severity of its impact. Risk management helps decision \\nmakers evaluate multiple threats and prioritize policy \\nresponses under conditions of uncertainty.  Risk management processes can be used by a community \\nto evaluate risks associated with climate change and \\nsuggest adaptation measures. Risk management \\nmethodologies can provide a way to explore public \\nattitudes and perceptions of risk, and this information can \\nfeed back into the assessment. The evaluation process \\nmay be formal or informal and may be quantitative \\nor qualitative, depending on what works best for the \\nmunicipality. In addition to common risk management \\nprocesses (for example, ISO31000, CSA Q850), which can \\nbe used to assess climate change risks, several climate \\nchange-specific risk assessment tools have been developed \\nto assist Canadian communities (see Appendix A).  3.1  ASSESSMENTS OF COMMUNITY VULNERABILITY \\nAND RISK  20 |  L A N D  U S E  P L A N N I N G  T O O L S Heat and health vulnerability assessment in Windsor, Ontario\\nWindsor (population 210 891) is Canada’s most southerly city and has summertime temperatures that are among \\nthe highest in Canada.61 Climate change is expected to significantly increase the number of extreme heat days \\nannually in the region. This may exacerbate the risk of heat-related illness and deaths, particularly among seniors, \\nthe chronically ill and other vulnerable groups.  Windsor was one of four pilot communities in a Health Canada project to develop community-based Heat Alert \\nand Response Systems (HARSs) to alert local residents when extreme temperatures pose a serious health concern \\nand to activate a coordinated public health response. The City of Windsor and Health Canada collaborated to \\nconduct a heat-health vulnerability assessment to help strengthen the design of the HARS as well as to engage \\nimportant stakeholders. The vulnerability assessment proceeded in five steps:62 (1) an initial assessment of the \\nscope, objectives, work plan and stakeholders involved; (2) the collection and analysis of data, including an \\nexamination of the relationship between temperature and mortality; (3) the projection of future climate for the \\nWindsor region; (4) a literature review to provide background information about the impacts of heat on health, \\nvulnerability assessment methods, and best adaptation practices; and (5) workshops to consult with stakeholders \\nand the community about existing vulnerabilities, adaptive capacity and potential adaptation actions. The \\nvulnerability assessment provided information that allowed public health officials to develop more effective \\nadaptation interventions.63  P\\nH O\\nT O\\n C O\\nU R\\nT E\\nS Y\\n O F\\n T O\\nU R\\nIS M\\n  W\\nIN D\\nS O\\nR  E\\nS S\\nE X\\n P E\\nL E\\nE  I\\nS L\\nA N\\nD  L A N D  U S E  P L A N N I N G  T O O L S  |  21  Dawson Climate Change Risk Evaluation64 Dawson City, Yukon (population 1350), is located just below the Arctic Circle at 64°N. In 2007, Dawson partnered \\nwith a local non-profit organization, the Northern Climate ExChange, to develop a community adaptation plan.  \\nAn evaluation of climate change-related risks was an important component of the planning process.  Public consultations were undertaken to identify community vulnerabilities and potential opportunities arising  \\nfrom climate change. The project team and a local advisory committee distilled community issues into a list of  \\n78 “community consequences” of climate change. For each of those, risk evaluation tables were completed jointly \\nby the project team and the advisory committee. An overall priority level (low, medium and high) for each impact \\nwas established through consideration of the severity and likelihood of a particular impact and the capacity of the \\ncommunity to take action to address it. Suggested adaptation actions were formulated for all consequences, and \\none or more partner organizations (for example, Yukon government and Dawson City council) were identified to \\nprovide leadership. See the framework example, in this case used to analyse agriculture/urban land-use conflicts.

Climate projections are generated from the outputs of \\none or more climate models. These models are complex \\ncomputer programs that simulate the behaviour of the \\natmosphere, the oceans, land surfaces, clouds and other \\nkey components of the climate system.67 The models depict \\nfuture conditions at different scales – some encompass \\nthe entire globe while others focus on specific regions. \\nGenerally, uncertainty increases at the finer spatial \\nscales. To examine future climates, models incorporate \\nassumptions about greenhouse gas emissions in the \\nfuture. For example, some assume fast-rising emissions \\nwhile others assume more gradual growth and eventual \\nreductions in emissions. Uncertainty is an inherent part of \\nall climate projections, owing to challenges in modelling \\ncomplex climate systems and in foreseeing future global \\nactions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Climate change projections may be applied to local \\nplanning processes in various ways, including the following: •  as tools for learning and public engagement. \\nPlanners may present climate projections to \\nstakeholders and the public to raise awareness \\nabout the nature and magnitude of possible changes \\nto the local climate, thus stimulating discussion \\namongst stakeholders about potential impacts, \\nlocal vulnerabilities, adaptive capacity and preferred \\napproaches to adaptation. •  as part of assessments of community \\nvulnerabilities and risks. In formulating adaptation \\nplans, communities often utilize climate projections \\nwhen studying the nature and extent of local risk \\nand vulnerabilities, including the capacity of key \\nstakeholders and residents to cope with and respond \\neffectively to increased stress.  •  as parameters for setting the design tolerance \\nof systems and structures. For example, a \\nmunicipality may, based on projected changes in the \\nintensity of future rainfall events, change the design \\ncriteria for the diameter of storm-water pipes to \\naccommodate greater flows. Although projections are a useful decision-support tool, \\nthere are adaptation measures that communities can take \\nwithout having to use or commission climate projections. \\nCommunities can, for example, base their adaptation \\nplanning decisions on an analysis of current vulnerabilities \\nor on information gleaned from reliable regional, national \\nor international assessments (which make use of climate \\nprojections). It is important that planners are cognizant of \\nthe inherent uncertainties embedded in projections and \\ncommunicate them accurately to decision makers and \\nthe\\xa0public.   L A N D  U S E  P L A N N I N G  T O O L S  |  23  Halifax Harbour plan for sea level rise68,69 Halifax (population 390 000), the capital of Nova Scotia, is a major seaport with significant industrial, military and \\nmunicipal infrastructure on the coast. Rising sea level, along with increased storm intensity and associated waves \\nand storm surges, presents risks to residents, property and infrastructure in coastal areas of the city. To respond \\nto these impacts, in 2006 the city recognized the need to gather scientific data on sea level rise, storm surges and \\nvulnerability to inform development of an area-specific land use plan for Halifax Harbour. City planners partnered with a team of scientists to develop projections of future sea levels and storm water levels \\nin Halifax Harbour under three climate scenarios for 2100: (1) a continuation of the historical rate of change, (2) the \\nupper-limit projection for mean sea level rise from the fourth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel \\non Climate Change (IPCC) and (3) a projection based on more recent scientific literature. High-resolution mapping \\nof possible future flood levels was then produced for each scenario. Following a presentation by scientists and \\ncity staff, Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM) Council in 2010 chose scenario 2c as a policy reference point from \\nwhich to develop the adaptation strategy. HRM is also committed to re-examining this choice when additional \\nscientific information becomes available. This example demonstrates that credible climate projections, based \\non best available science that are communicated to the public and decision makers in a format that is easily \\nunderstandable, provide a helpful foundation for adaptation action at the municipal level.

Flooding and the devastation of the region’s forests by the mountain pine beetle are \\nthe climate-related impacts of greatest concern to the community. In 2008, the City partnered with the University of \\nNorthern British Columbia (UNBC)70 to mainstream climate change adaptation into the city’s policies and programs. The City and UNBC partnered with the Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium at the University of Victoria to produce \\na climate trends and projections report specific to the Prince George region.71 The report assessed historical \\ntrends (1918 to 2006) for precipitation, temperature and stream flow as well as projected changes (for the 2020s, \\n2050s and 2080s) in temperature and precipitation using global climate models. UNBC and the City organized \\ntwo adaptation workshops and other information events that brought together city staff, the public and key \\nstakeholders to discuss approaches to dealing with climate change impacts. Climate experts from PCIC presented \\na summary of the projections at the workshops. Participants were asked to discuss the potential social, economic \\nand environmental implications of the projected changes for Prince George and define key impacts for the city. The \\nclimate change projections were a useful tool for establishing a credible baseline from which workshop participants \\ncould engage and discuss impacts and adaptation actions. Prince George has since integrated the findings from the \\nworkshops, including recommended measures to reduce risks from forest fires and flooding, into the Integrated \\nCommunity Sustainability Plan72 and draft Official Community Plan.

To help the community prepare for \\nfuture climate changes, a scenario planning project was conducted in 2009, led by a local college in collaboration \\nwith the territorial government, local and First Nations governments, private sector firms and community groups.76,77  In a series of meetings, members of the community identified local vulnerabilities under four possible “future \\nhistories” of Whitehorse. To create those histories, two climate change scenarios and two development scenarios \\nwere generated. For instance, Scenario 4, entitled City of Crossroads, envisions a high degree of climate change \\n(median temperature rise of 4°C) as well as significant population growth (24 000 new residents). The other future \\nhistories have different assumptions regarding climate change and development. Participants brainstormed on the \\nsocial, economic and environmental consequences associated with each scenario. Certain impacts or concerns \\nthat were common across the four histories were deemed to be consequences most likely to occur and therefore \\nbecame priorities for developing adaptation actions. The priorities included increased risk of forest fire, shifts in the \\navailability of water, infrastructure decline, energy and food security, and potential land use conflicts. The study \\nalso allowed planners to identify the range of impacts that any one adaptation measure could address and how \\nthese measures may fit with other planning initiatives.  Climate changes (e.g. extent of temperature  \\nrise and increase in snow) some climate change lots of climate change Development trajectory \\n(e.g. population growth) low Scenario 1:  \\nCity of Wilderness Scenario 2:  \\nCity of People high Scenario 3:  \\nCity of Mettle Scenario 4:  \\nCity of Crossroads A scenario is a plausible, simplified description of \\nhow the future may develop. Scenario planning is a \\nstrategic medium- to long-term planning tool in which \\nplanners develop multiple scenarios describing potential \\nsocial, economic and environmental conditions in a \\ncommunity and then formulate strategies and measures \\nto achieve planning goals under one or more of those \\nscenarios.73 Long used by government and the private \\nsector for managing uncertainty, scenario planning is \\nnow being applied by some communities to prepare for \\nclimate\\xa0change. In planning for adaptation to climate change, planners \\ndevise scenarios that demonstrate how changes in climate \\nmay affect the community under different development \\ntrajectories (see the diagram in the following Whitehorse \\nexample). The development trajectories are based on a few \\nkey variables expected to drive change, such as population \\ngrowth, technological shifts or energy demand. Different \\nnarratives about how climate change may unfold in the  community are derived from scientific projections, expert \\nassessments and other sources.74 Planning scenarios assist adaptation planning and policy-\\nmaking in several ways. The process of constructing the \\nscenarios educates stakeholders about the nature and \\nextent of future climate-related risks and opportunities. \\nScenarios may provide information that helps to identify \\nemerging vulnerabilities (for example, potential conflict \\nover access to water) and support efforts to prioritize \\nclimate change risks. They also assist in devising adaptation \\nstrategies and actions to address vulnerabilities. The \\nmost robust measures are those effective across different \\nscenarios. For example, in communities at risk from \\nwildfires, proper firebreak maintenance can be a useful \\nadaptation measure regardless of the magnitude of climate \\nchange experienced and the rate of development. In \\nother cases, planners may develop contingent adaptation \\nstrategies that would be implemented in the event a \\nparticular scenario begins to unfold.75  26 |  L A N D  U S E  P L A N N I N G  T O O L S 3.4 VISUALIZING CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS Toronto’s heat vulnerability mapping tool79 As the climate changes, Toronto is expected to \\nexperience more intense and prolonged heat \\nwaves. Extreme heat is a public health issue of \\nparticular concern to the city’s senior citizens, to \\npersons suffering from respiratory illnesses and to \\nother vulnerable populations. Toronto Public Health \\n(TPH) has developed a mapping tool to visualize \\nareas of elevated human vulnerability to extreme \\nheat. The maps incorporate numerous indicators of \\nvulnerability, including surface temperatures, green \\nspace coverage, housing and social characteristics \\nof at-risk populations, access to air conditioning, \\nand the location of cool places. The tool helps TPH \\nand community partners identify and prioritize \\ngeographic hot spots for delivering resources during \\na heat alert. The City also plans to use the tool for \\nlong-term climate adaptation planning.  Maps and other landscape visualizations can illustrate, in \\na simple and effective manner,78 the nature and extent of \\nthe changes expected in the local climate, the severity of \\npossible impacts, and what proposed adaptation responses \\nmight look like. Such visualizations support decision making \\nby translating scientific concepts into maps or images \\nthat have clear and practical meaning to non-scientists \\nand the public. They can facilitate dialogue during the \\nplanning\\xa0process. MAPS Maps are one of the most common adaptation decision-\\nsupport tools used by planners. They can range from \\nsimple hand-drawn maps to those developed by using \\nsophisticated computer software. Maps have been used \\nto identify geographic areas of the municipality at risk \\nfrom climate-related impacts, the location of vulnerable \\ninfrastructure and populations, or to demarcate places \\nwhere certain adaptation-related policies apply. For \\nexample, the potential extent of shoreline erosion or storm \\nsurge flooding under various climate change scenarios  can be mapped. Maps can also be readily referenced or \\nincorporated into land use planning tools, such as zoning \\nbylaws, official plans and policy documents.  VISUALIZATIONS Increasingly, municipalities employ computer animation \\nsoftware to create three-dimensional visualizations at the \\nstreet and neighbourhood scales. The software combines \\nimages of the existing features of the community (for \\nexample, roads, buildings and trees near the shore) with \\nclimate-related impacts projected for the area (for example, \\nhigher sea level). The animations help people visualize \\nthe losses that may be incurred under such conditions \\nand illustrate the consequences of a particular adaptation \\nmeasure. For example, planners may want to create an \\nimage showing how raising a dike or levee would affect \\nviews of the ocean from various waterfront properties. The \\nresulting images may be useful in engaging the affected \\nland owners and the public when evaluating the merits of a \\nproposed adaptation measure, such as raising a sea dike.

CALP and UBC’s \\nOkanagan campus developed a 3D virtual environment where Delta residents could see what adaptation actions \\nwould look like. For example, the following image shows a typical residential street inundated by flood waters \\nfollowing a major storm surge event. Delta officials found the visualization process useful in engaging local \\nresidents. Since the public consultations in 2007, Delta has integrated adaptation into various infrastructure and \\noperational decisions.   28 |  L A N D  U S E  P L A N N I N G  T O O L S 3.5 ADAPTATION PLANNING GUIDEBOOKS Windsor’s Climate Change Adaptation Plan\\nWindsor (population 216 000) is located in southwestern Ontario on the south shore of the Detroit River and Lake \\nSt. Clair. Climate change impacts of concern include an expected increase in the frequency and intensity of heavy \\nrain storms and heat waves (a doubling of the number of 30°C days has been projected by 2050).83 These changes \\ncould pose serious problems for the city. In 2010, for example, a significant rainstorm that delivered 90 mm of rain \\nin a 24-hour period led to widespread basement flooding throughout the city.84 Windsor began developing its adaptation plan in 2010. The City is working through the five-step adaptation \\nplanning process outlined in Changing Climate, Changing Communities, a guidebook published by ICLEI Canada.85 \\nThe steps are initiate, research, plan, implement and monitor. The City is midway through that planning process. \\nThe development of Windsor’s adaptation plan builds on existing initiatives, including a heat alert and emergency \\nresponse system, the expansion of a waste water treatment facility, various initiatives aimed at reducing basement \\nflooding, and the construction of a new retention treatment basin to reduce combined sewer overflows. City officials \\nintend to integrate the actions identified in the adaptation plan into existing policies, programs and operations.

The town \\nis vulnerable to sea level rise and storm surge flooding. \\nIn 2010, the Government of Nova Scotia required \\nmunicipalities to prepare and submit a climate change \\naction plan by 2013 as a condition for receiving federal \\ngas-tax funds. In November 2011, the Province published \\nthe Municipal Climate Change Action Plan Guidebook \\nto help municipalities prepare their action plans.86 \\nYarmouth was one of three pilot communities to work \\nthrough the Guidebook. The lessons learned were used \\nto assist other municipalities in undertaking similar \\ninitiatives. Yarmouth is developing a long-term strategic approach \\nfor managing climate change hazards. Between October \\n2011 and February 2012, with assistance from the \\nDalhousie School of Planning, Yarmouth worked through the six steps in the Guidebook. Before submitting its \\nPlan to the Province in 2013, the Town intends to host a public consultation session and continue to refine its \\nAction Plan. Despite some challenges, town staff found it to be a useful process. In particular, the formation of \\nthe steering committee, composed of staff from different departments, has allowed colleagues to work together \\nacross functional areas.  Steps to develop an action plan 1. Build an adaptation team/committee.  2. Assess impacts and hazards. 3. Identify affected locations. 4. Identify and evaluate the impacts to \\naffected facilities, infrastructure and \\nservices.  5. Identify local social, economic and \\nenvironment considerations.  6.

Those laws establish the regulatory and \\npolicy tools that control land use at the local level \\nand define how and when they may be used. For \\nexample, provincial planning acts prescribe the kinds \\nof zoning bylaws a municipality may adopt. The \\nprovinces define the suite of tools available to local \\ngovernment to design and implement adaptation \\nplans and measures. •  provincial planning policies – Provinces adopt \\nregulations and policies, to which local and regional \\nplans generally must conform, on planning issues \\nof concern across the province. Those policies may \\naddress topics relevant to local adaptation efforts. For \\ninstance, a province may prescribe planning standards \\ndesigned to protect agricultural land and contain \\nurbanization at the fringes of a metropolitan area. \\nThose standards may facilitate enhanced regional \\nfood security and the design of more resilient urban \\ncommunities. •  provincial adaptation plans and programs – \\nMany provinces have their own formal plans for \\nadapting to climate change. Typically, such plans \\nspecify provincial goals and objectives; identify the \\nimpacts of climate change on government programs, \\noperations and infrastructure; and suggest specific \\nactions. For example, a plan may call for more high-\\ndefinition aerial mapping or enhanced monitoring of \\nwater quality. Provinces also disseminate guidelines \\nand technical information and can act as facilitators \\nand conveners to assist local governments, the private \\nsector and civic organizations in adapting to climate \\nchange. Finally, provinces fund programs that can \\nsupport local adaptation (for example, subsidies for \\nan urban tree planting program to reduce the urban \\nheat island effect).  •  direct involvement in development decisions\\xa0– \\nIn most local planning matters, the provincial \\ngovernment plays an indirect, oversight role (for \\ninstance, as appellate bodies on a zoning dispute \\nor as the final approving authority on local official \\nplans). In some circumstances, provincial officials \\nare directly involved in local development decisions. \\nThis may be the case for sites and issues that fall \\nunder direct provincial jurisdiction, such as highway \\nconstruction, unincorporated communities, local \\nprojects on crown land, projects affecting heritage \\nproperties, and environmental assessments of large \\ninfrastructure projects. In such cases, provincial \\nofficials may contribute directly to decisions on the \\ndesign and implementation of local adaptation \\nmeasures. •  intergovernmental relations – Provinces negotiate \\nagreements, collaborate on programs and projects, \\nand manage their relations with other provinces \\nand the federal government. In that capacity, a \\nprovince can help set the conditions for participation \\nby local governments in programs that support or \\ncomplement adaptation. An example is the set of \\nagreements between the Government of Canada and \\nvarious provinces governing the allocation of federal \\ngas-tax funds.  The nature and extent of provincial involvement in local \\nadaptation planning varies between provinces, depending \\non legal and institutional frameworks, the planning culture \\nand practice of each location, and many other factors. TERRITORIES Like provincial governments, the governments of the \\nterritories of Nunavut, the Northwest Territories and \\nYukon have jurisdiction over land use planning and many \\nother local matters. However, these legislative powers do \\nnot spring directly from the Constitution but instead are \\ndelegated to the territories by the Government of Canada \\nunder various laws.89,90,91 Territorial governments in turn \\nenact legislation and adopt policies to guide planning by \\nlocal and regional authorities within their borders.92,93  L A N D  U S E  P L A N N I N G  T O O L S  |  31  While the legal framework for land use planning in the \\nterritories differs from that in the provinces, the roles \\nthat territorial governments play in adaptation to climate \\nchange roughly correspond to those described in the \\nProvinces section of this appendix. For example, territorial  governments also adopt climate change strategies and \\nactions plans.94,95,96 Territorial land-use planning practices \\nand territorial government involvement in local adaptation \\nplanning vary by territory, depending on the enabling \\nfederal legislation and other factors. British Columbia’s Climate Action Plan97 British Columbia released its Climate Action Plan in June 2008. Chapter 5 describes the Province’s vision, strategies \\nand activities as it prepares for climate change. In responding to the increased likelihood of severe weather events, \\nthe provincial government is taking action to (1) ensure that new development on flood plains will be flood-proofed \\nto provincial standards, (2) consider the impacts of climate change when awarding provincial infrastructure grants, \\n(3) develop a comprehensive plan for green community development and (4) ensure that community development \\nstrategies recognize the importance of streams and rivers. The Province is currently updating its planning policy \\nstatements and guidelines, including the Guidelines for Management of Coastal Flood Hazard Land Use. The \\nGuidelines describe new land use tools that local governments may adopt, including sea level rise planning areas and \\nrisk-based zoning.98  Prince Edward Island’s Climate Change Strategy99 Prince Edward Island’s Climate Change Strategy outlines measures to both reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to \\ndeal with the impacts of climate change. The strategy adopts a risk-based approach to adaptation as it “is the most \\npractical way to ensure that adaptation responses are socially acceptable, cost-effective and consistent with the \\ncommunity’s wider social, environmental and economic goals.” The impacts of climate change on coasts – such as sea \\nlevel rise, increased storm surge flooding and erosion – are highlighted as issues of concern. The strategy identifies \\nfive overarching adaptation objectives and actions, all of which have direct implications at the municipal level. For \\nexample, the Province committed to reviewing all provincial land use and development policies to encourage more \\nsustainable options for future land development and to better adapt to changing climate conditions. Manitoba’s Provincial Planning Regulation \\nManitoba’s Provincial Planning Regulation100 (the Regulation) identifies both climate change mitigation and adaptation \\nas strategic priorities, along with other key concerns such as clean water and public safety. Community resilience is \\nrecognized as a key principle of sound land use planning.  The Regulation identifies issues of provincial interest to be addressed in local development plans and goals to be \\npursued in various policy areas. For instance, with respect to general development policy, the provincial interest \\nincludes directing development toward areas where risk can be minimized and taking into account climate change \\nvulnerabilities. With regard to water, provincial interest includes the development of strategies to prioritize allocation \\nand implementation of conservation measures to build community resilience. The Regulation prohibits certain kinds of \\ndevelopment in or near water bodies and prescribes minimum setbacks for new development. The policy on planning \\nfor agriculture recognizes the potential increased demand for food production in response to climate change and \\nencourages local authorities to promote food security. At a strategic level, the Regulation requires that each local \\nplanning authority assess local vulnerabilities to climate change and consider existing climate change action plans \\nwhen preparing, amending or replacing the local development plan.   32 |  L A N D  U S E  P L A N N I N G  T O O L S Appendix B \\nAdditional resources on select decision-support tools VISUALIZING CLIMATE \\nCHANGE\\xa0IMPACTS Local Climate Change Visioning and Landscape \\nVisualizations: Guidance Manual (2010).

It involves  making adjustments in our decisions, activities and  thinking because of observed or expected changes  in climate.2 Some ways municipalities act  •  planning and land use controls: zoning, official  plans, development reviews •  provision of public services: utilities, public  transit, road maintenance, snow removal, fire  and police, emergency preparedness •  forum for public dialogue and information:  public awareness campaigns, deliberation  on bylaws and programs, information on  city\\xa0services •  collection of taxes and user fees: property  taxes, recreational facility fees, parking fees  •  management of public land and buildings:  establishment of parks, renovation of civic  buildings, operation of water treatment plants Canada’s climate is changing rapidly. Although all levels  of government have important roles to play to advance  adaptation, action at the local level is particularly important  because that is where many of the impacts of climate  change will be felt most directly.1 Local governments in Canada can manage the risks and  opportunities presented by climate through a variety  of practices, including adoption and enforcement of  bylaws; collection of taxes and user fees; operation of  transportation, utilities and other public infrastructure;  establishment of subsidies, tax credits and other incentive  programs; administration of emergency management  and response systems; and public outreach and  education\\xa0initiatives. Land use planning is one of the most effective processes  to facilitate local adaptation to climate change.3,4  Historically, local governments have used land use planning  tools – official plans, zoning, development permits and  others – to minimize risks to communities from floods,  wildfires, landslides and other natural hazards.5 As the  climate changes, so will the frequency and magnitude of  climate-related hazards, posing a challenge for community  planners. A recent survey by the Canadian Institute of  Planners confirmed that “planners gravitate to tools they  know best and are looking for ways to adapt known tools  when addressing climate change.”6  P H O T O  C O U R T E S Y  O F  J E R R Y  M O U L A N D  2 |  L A N D  U S E  P L A N N I N G  T O O L S2 |  L A N D  U S E  P L A N N I N G  T O O L S Planning tools and climate change  risk reduction  Generally speaking, planning tools can be used to  reduce climate risks in four ways: •  limiting development in hazard-prone areas •  ensuring that the built environment can  withstand a range of environmental stress •  helping to preserve natural environments  that protect communities against hazards  (for example, dunes that absorb coastal  storm\\xa0effects)  •  educating stakeholders and decision makers  about risks and opportunities and fostering  dialogue about adaptation This document describes tools in the land use planning  sector that communities can use in preparing to adapt to  climate change. In addition, it provides information on  decision-support tools, tools that provide information and  resources to help planners and local decision makers take  effective adaptation action.  A brief example of each tool and its use by a Canadian  community is given. Not every case discussed here was  explicitly motivated by a desire to adapt to climate change.  However, the significance of the tool to adaptation  planning is clear in each case. An effort was made to select  examples from communities of varying sizes and from all  regions of Canada.   Although the examples are of broad utility, the design and  application of a particular planning tool can vary greatly  from one jurisdiction to another, depending on provincial  or territorial laws and other factors. We describe the  provincial and territorial roles in local adaptation planning  in Appendix A. Readers interested in knowing how a  particular tool is applied in a specific community should  consult provincial, territorial and local laws. It is important to keep in mind that land use planning is  used to pursue many local policy objectives, including  providing affordable housing, stimulating job growth,  preserving the character and heritage of a community,  reducing greenhouse gas emissions, protecting biodiversity  and enabling efficient transportation. A key challenge for  planners and local decision makers is how to incorporate  and balance the need to prepare for climate change  through adaptation with other local development  objectives. Another consideration is how to integrate  (mainstream) consideration of changing climate into  the wide array of decisions made by local governments,  from operating municipal services to capital spending,  enforcement and inspection activities, collection of taxes,  and administration of disaster response programs.

Land use planning refers to the processes and instruments  employed to manage the use of land and the physical  development of a community for the common interest.  A variety of statutory and other measures – bylaws,  incentives, information and guidance, spending programs\\xa0–  may be applied to control how land is used. The scale of  action is usually the neighbourhood, a whole town or city  or a metropolitan area. Tools for the regulation of individual  buildings, such as building codes, green building standards,  property taxes and the like, are closely related to land use  planning but are not covered in this document.  2.0 Land use planning tools  4 |  L A N D  U S E  P L A N N I N G  T O O L S P H O T O  C O U R T E S Y  O F  J E R R Y  M O U L A N D P H O T O  C O U R T E S Y  O F  J E R R Y  M O U L A N D 2.1 OFFICIAL PLANS An official plan is a formal planning document, often  required by provincial law, that sets out a comprehensive  long-term vision and the goals and objectives for the  development of a community.7 Preparing such a plan  typically begins with expert analyses of local conditions  and includes public consultations as well as reviews by local  advisory committees and provincial and other authorities.  After the plan is finalized, the local council adopts it  formally by enacting a bylaw. Provincial approval may be  required as well.  Also entitled general, community or master plans, these  documents identify the major social, economic and  environmental challenges facing the community and  articulate strategies to address them. Official plans are  in force for a relatively long period (10 years or longer)  with updates required periodically (every five years in  some provinces). They may designate some areas of the  community as appropriate locations for new growth  Iqaluit’s General Plan8 Iqaluit (population 6200), the capital of Nunavut, is one of the first Canadian communities to integrate climate  change adaptation into its General Plan. One of the five priority vision statements identifies Iqaluit as “a community  that adapts to climate change.” The plan sets out two high-level objectives to realize this vision: (1) to study the  impacts of climate change on the community and (2) to adopt policies that recognize the long-term impacts of  climate change. The plan includes more detail on the climate change issues of concern to the community (for  example, increases in temperature and precipitation, permafrost thaw, decreases in sea ice, and accelerated coastal  erosion) and priority adaptation actions related to municipal infrastructure. P H O T O  C O U R T E S Y  O F  M IC H E L E  B E R T O L while others are to be preserved or revitalised. Official  plans serve as guiding documents for subsequent local  policies, programs and bylaws (such as zoning codes and  subdivision\\xa0controls). Climate change adaptation can be incorporated directly  into a municipality’s official plan, either in a dedicated  section or embedded throughout the document. Such  texts normally detail local climate change risks and  opportunities, an overarching adaptation vision and policy,  as well as priority adaptation needs. Adaptation strategies  and actions in official plans include mainstreaming  adaptation into all or selected municipal operations,  undertaking a comprehensive municipal risk assessment  process to prioritize risks and opportunities, developing  a comprehensive municipal adaptation action plan, or  obtaining critical information or technical data for making  effective and appropriate adaptation decisions.   L A N D  U S E  P L A N N I N G  T O O L S  |  5  Elkford’s Official Community Plan9,10 The District of Elkford is a small community (population 2500) in the Rocky Mountains of southeastern British  Columbia. Historically, Elkford has dealt with several climate-related hazards, including flooding, drought and  wildfires. A changing climate magnifies all these risks. In 2008, Elkford, with support of the Columbia Basin Trust,  a provincial crown corporation, developed a local adaptation strategy to assess the risks posed by climate change  and identify corresponding adaptation actions. The Adaptation Strategy was developed concurrently with a revision  to Elkford’s Official Community Plan (OCP), allowing the two to be fully integrated. Consideration of climate  change in all decision making is one of the OCP’s 11 guiding principles. Adaptation actions in the OCP include  a wildfire protection zone in which any development application must be accompanied by a fire hazard and risk  assessment conducted by certified professionals before a permit is issued. The OCP also calls for the development  of a community evacuation plan in the event of an extreme wildfire or flooding.

Those plans may focus on one  function of local government (such as public transit or  storm water management), on a sector or issue of special  significance to the community (such as the development  of the arts or the needs of senior citizens) or on a  neighbourhood with special planning needs.11 As with  official plans, these local plans are often developed through  a formal planning process, including public consultation,  and provide an assessment of conditions, a long-term vision  and a set of goals and actions for the particular issue or  area in question.  A growing number of Canadian municipalities have  adopted plans that specifically address the need to adapt to  climate change. Some communities have chosen to develop  stand-alone adaptation plans. Those documents typically  outline the climate change impacts of concern to the  community, the associated risks and opportunities, and the  community’s vision and proposed actions for dealing with  those changes. Many other communities have integrated  consideration of climate change adaptation into local plans  that address other issues. For example, a municipality may  integrate adaptation into its capital improvement plan for  storm water sewer systems. Stratford’s Climate Change Adaptation Plan12 The Town of Stratford (population 8046), a rapidly growing community in Prince Edward Island, is located on a  peninsula just south of the provincial capital, Charlottetown. The main climate change issues of concern to the  community are coastal erosion, which already threatens several important heritage buildings and homes, sea level  rise, storm surge and inland flooding.  In 2010, the Town, in partnership with the Canadian Institute of Planners and the Atlantic Planners Institute,  created a long-term strategic plan to prepare Stratford for climate change. The process comprised four stages:  (1) forming a core working group to establish overarching objectives, engage key stakeholders and conduct  background research into local climate change impacts; (2) organizing public meetings to assess current and future  vulnerabilities (following a presentation of the potential climate change impacts, a survey was distributed to all  participants at the public meeting to gauge climate change-related opportunities and threats for the community);  (3) conducting a risk assessment, building on results of the vulnerability assessment, to rank the most important  climate change impacts and identify priority areas for adaptation action; and (4) preparing a final adaptation plan  that included recommended adaptation actions by theme (for example, heritage properties, parks and recreation,  private properties, emergency services, storm water infrastructure). Stratford has since integrated adaptation  considerations into all new or updated community action plans, including its draft Official Plan, Strategic Plan and  Master Stormwater Management Plan.

The city’s urban tree  canopy is seriously threatened by drought,  insect infestations, disease, storms and climate  change. These threats spurred Edmonton to  create the Urban Forest Management Plan  (UFMP) to guide the management of the tree  canopy over a 10-year period. The UFMP  includes developing an inventory of the urban  forest (completed 2009), a review of existing  planting strategies, a communication plan and  potential tree planting partnerships. Many  of these actions will increase resilience to  drought conditions, which may be exacerbated  by climate change. For example, Edmonton’s  Forestry Unit is testing the use of different tree  species, such as red maples, and alternative  tree watering techniques.  imagineCALGARY14 Calgary (population 1 096 833) is situated in southern Alberta. The impact of climate change on water quality and  quantity is of particular concern in the area. Local rivers are expected to experience decreased flow because of  decreased precipitation and reduced glacial coverage in the headwaters of the river basins.15 imagineCALGARY was  a community visioning and consultation process undertaken in 2005 to produce a 100-year roadmap for Calgary’s  development. The process engaged more than 18 000 Calgarians representing businesses, community agencies,  non-profits and governments as well as the public. Calgary is one of the first communities in Canada to consider  climate change in its long-range planning. The City commissioned scoping reports to investigate how four major  trends might impact the city: demographic changes, resource scarcity, technology transformation and climate  change. Since publishing the imagineCALGARY plan in 2007, the City has implemented its vision and targets in  subsequent land use plans and strategies. Numerous local partner organizations in the private, non-profit and  public sectors have also committed to achieving the vision by changing their policies and practices.

Zoning bylaws divide  the entire community into zones. For each zone, only  certain land uses are permitted (for example, commercial,  residential, industrial). In addition to restrictions on the  use of the property, the zoning bylaws may impose  requirements on buildings, including maximum height,  lot coverage and density, as well as building type and  setbacks. Those requirements are reflected in a zoning  map for the jurisdiction. Zoning restrictions usually apply  only\\xa0prospectively.19 Zoning codes can be used by municipalities to limit new  development in hazard-prone areas (for instance in areas  subject to wildfires, landslides or coastal erosion) or to  prescribe building standards that reduce vulnerability to  environmental stress.20,21 For example, in areas of high  flood risk, all development may be prohibited, while in  areas where the risk is lower, the ground floor of new  buildings and structures may be required to be built  above a minimum height to avoid flood damage.22 Given  that climate change often magnifies existing hazard risk,  municipalities could respond by modifying existing zoning  restrictions to factor in the greater intensity, frequency or  duration of certain hazards as climate changes. Beaubassin-est’s sea level rise protection zone23 Beaubassin-est (population 6200), a small coastal community in southeast New Brunswick, is vulnerable to  the impacts of sea level rise and storm surge flooding. The Community is one of the first in New Brunswick  to implement a minimum height standard for buildings to address climate change impacts. Council passed an  updated zoning bylaw in March 2011 to better protect new construction in the community’s coastal zone.  The bylaw identifies a sea level rise “protection zone” in which the minimum ground floor elevation of any new  building must be at least 1.43 metres above the current 1-in-100-year flood mark. The regulation is an overlay  zone\\xa0– all previous zoning conditions apply. Rather than restrict development outright, the zoning bylaw imposes  stricter building requirements on developers. This new regulation provides an opportunity to educate developers  as well as the community at large about the impacts of climate change and sea level rise. This update to the bylaw  was based on the best available scientific understanding of sea level rise for the area and a high resolution digital  map that the community commissioned to help identify potential flood levels.

The urban heat island effect is pronounced in many parts of the borough. Urban heat islands are areas in  cities where ambient air temperatures tend to be hotter than in surrounding areas. They occur where there is little  vegetation and a high percentage of dark surfaces, such as tar roofs, asphalt roads and parking lots.  In April 2011, the borough council revised its comprehensive zoning bylaw to include four regulatory measures  aimed at tackling urban heat islands: (1) when replacing an existing roof or constructing a new building, the owner  must install either a green roof or a highly reflective roof; (2) for all new parking lots of 10 or more spaces, at least  15 percent of the area must be open ground landscaped with plants, bushes and trees; (3) all new paving materials  must meet a minimum specified surface reflectivity rating; and (4) when constructing a new building, at least  20\\xa0percent of the building site must remain open ground and be landscaped with plants, bushes and trees.  These four measures apply to all public and private property throughout the borough. More than 300 permits for  reflective roofs were issued in the first year after the bylaw was passed.

The  controls, which may apply to subdivisions of land, new  construction or alterations to existing buildings, allow local  officials to evaluate projects case by case.7 Among them are •  subdivision controls – which apply when a developer  wants to divide a parcel of land, often for residential  development. Generally, subdivision plans must  demonstrate good access and efficient utility service  for all the proposed lots and also address concerns  about financial, environmental and other\\xa0impacts. •  site plan controls, development permits,  development agreements and similar tools –  which require developers to submit detailed designs  to be assessed against specified criteria. For example,  a proposal may be reviewed for the quality of the  design of public areas, the fit with the historic  character of the neighbourhood, or the extent of  disturbance to ecologically sensitive land. •  comprehensive development zones, planned  unit developments and similar instruments –  that apply to large sites in which non-standard or  innovative designs and techniques are to be used,  and a customised approach to zoning and site design  is appropriate. As part of the evaluation of proposals under these types  of regulations, local officials may seek changes to projects  prior to approval. Further, the developer may be required to  pay development charges, dedicate a portion of the site for  public use or provide some other concession or amenity. These project-based, discretionary development controls  can be very useful for adapting to climate change at the  neighbourhood scale. For example, as part of the review  of a subdivision proposal, the developer may be asked to  assess the increased risk of erosion due to climate change  and to determine how it may affect the development.  The municipality may require that appropriate adaptation  measures be taken by the developer, such as shoreline  restoration or increased development setbacks. The lots  in a proposed subdivision may be clustered in the least  hazardous part of the property. In other cases, a site plan  control ordinance may be used to require that green design  features that address the impacts of climate change be  incorporated (for instance, providing shade and rooftop  gardens to decrease the public health risk from urban  heat\\xa0islands).  Toronto’s Green Standard Toronto, Ontario (population 2.6 million), is situated at the centre  of a conurbation of more than 5 million people. Climate change  impacts of concern for the city include increased health risks due  to extreme heat, higher incidence of pests and diseases (such as  West Nile virus) and more extreme rainfall with consequences for  storm-water systems and other infrastructure.26 The Toronto Green Standard (TGS) is a set of performance  measures for site and building design, covering energy and water  efficiency, air and water quality, ecological services and solid waste  management. The standards work with the regular development  approval and inspection process, and apply to all new development subject to subdivision or site plan controls or  for which a zoning amendment is required.27 Although adaptation is not explicitly mentioned, the TGS addresses  several climate change impacts of concern to the city. For example, one provision, applicable to non-residential  development of three stories or less, requires the use of light-coloured materials, open-grid pavement or shading  on at least 50 percent of the site to reduce urban heat. Another provision requires that new developments retain at  least the first 5 millimetres (mm) from each rainfall through rainwater reuse, plantings and other practices, thereby  reducing storm water runoff. A more stringent set of voluntary standards has been adopted. Developments that  meet those stricter standards are eligible for reductions in development fees.

Climate change, which is expected to bring more frequent storms to the  area, will likely increase the vulnerability of coastal development and infrastructure.28 Various community plans,  including the 2006 HRM Regional Plan, already call for new developments to be constructed a minimum height  above the ordinary high-water mark.29  One flexible mechanism that planners in Halifax use to address coastal threats is development agreements. Certain  areas of the community are designated as zones where review and approval of development projects proceed  through negotiation. Local bylaws specify in general terms the matters to be considered in such negotiations,  giving planners latitude to address a broad range of issues regarding environmental protection, natural hazards  and other concerns.30 The developer may be asked to produce relevant information (such as the impacts of  wave-run up on a particular property) and to consider and adopt appropriate hazard mitigation strategies. In a  recent development in downtown Dartmouth (an HRM municipality), local officials and the developer agreed to  establish minimum elevations for a new marina and other seaside structures that were several metres higher than  provided in area plans. This was consistent both with the developer’s interest in protecting the property and the  community’s interest in minimizing risk. The development agreement process enabled planners and developers to  exchange information on storm surge and wave run up on this site, and to produce a more resilient project design.

An easement may allow the  public to pass through private land to reach a beach. Both  covenants and easements are said to “run with the land,”  which means they bind current as well as future owners.  There are strict and complex legal requirements that apply  when creating easements or covenants.  Covenants may serve local planning goals in different ways:  •  as a development control tool – Municipalities  may use covenants when entering development  agreements, applying controls on subdivisions and  other development projects or imposing conditions  on issuing a development permit. In such cases,  these instruments ensure that community interests  are protected and that the developer’s promises  about the operation and maintenance of the  property are enforceable long after construction.  Covenants may be used in “green developments”  that use innovative energy, waste water treatment  and other systems that require public access and the  collaboration of future owners for proper operation  and maintenance.33 •  as a conservation tool – A special form of  covenant, known as a conservation covenant or  easement has been established by law in many  provinces. It places restrictions on the use of land to  protect its natural values. For example, a conservation  covenant may prohibit the removal of native  vegetation and prohibit any structures on a portion  of the property that contains sensitive ecosystems.  The owner who enters into a conservation covenant  continues to own the land and may live on it, sell it,  or pass it on to heirs but the covenant’s restrictions  on development are followed in the future, regardless  of who owns the land.34 In exchange, the land owner  may be eligible for tax reductions or credits. Covenants and easements can play an important role  in climate change adaptation planning. For example,  a municipality may acquire a conservation easement  to prevent residential development on a coastal area  threatened by sea level rise and storm surge flooding.   A covenant may be negotiated with owners in an area to  prevent construction of docks, sea walls or other coastal  protection structures in order to allow marshes and dunes  to migrate inland naturally.35 Covenants and easements may  also support local efforts to monitor climate change by, for  example, allowing access to a coastal property for purposes  of measuring erosion rates.  Island Trust’s NAPTEP Covenant The Islands Trust (population 25 000) is a federation of local governments  in the Gulf Islands and Howe Sound islands of British Columbia. The Islands  Trust Fund acts as the conservation arm of the federation, charged with  protecting the ecosystems in the region through land acquisition, conservation  covenants and education programs. Since 1990, it has protected more than  1073\\xa0hectares (ha) of land on 84 properties.36  Adaptation to climate change, especially the protection of biodiversity, is one  key concern of the Trust Fund. The effects of changing climate are already  evident in local ecosystems: vegetation is experiencing earlier green-up,  wildlife migration patterns are changing, and insect outbreaks are more  common.37 Up to 30 percent of assessed animal species are believed to be  at high risk of extirpation (local extinction).38 By establishing, monitoring and  managing conservation areas, the Trust Fund aims to maintain the ecological  functions of high biodiversity areas in the face of a changing climate. Under  the Trust Fund’s Natural Area Protection Tax Exemption Program (NAPTEP)  Covenant, land owners receive a 65 percent reduction in property taxes on  the protected portion of their land. The Trust Fund is developing a tool to  estimate the biodiversity value of properties to prioritize future acquisitions. P H O T O  C O U R T E S Y  O F  E .

Wildfires are one of several risks projected to increase as a result  of changing climate. In the summer of 2003, three large wildfires reached the city’s perimeter, threatening homes  and infrastructure. They increased local awareness and concern about the impacts of wildfires on the community. Covenants are one of a suite of tools the City uses in its efforts to reduce wildfire risk.39 In 1992, the City instituted  a policy specifying that, as a condition of subdivision approval, all new subdivisions within hazardous zones must  register a restrictive covenant.40 Under such a covenant, developers and home owners are bound to undertake  actions to reduce fire risks, including maintaining fuel-buffer zones around homes; controlling roofing materials  and installation of wooden shacks and shingles; screening of all eaves, attics, decks and openings under floors  to prevent the accumulation of flammable material; and installing approved spark arresters in all wood stoves. All  subdivisions constructed since 1992 in high to extreme wildfire hazard areas have registered restrictive wildfire  covenants. Kamloops is revising the 1992 covenant to improve clarity and ensure it conforms to the City’s latest fire  hazard assessment mapping.

Municipalities may develop design guidelines  for several reasons: to improve environmental performance,  reduce infrastructure costs, enhance aesthetics, increase  public safety or create more accessible public spaces.  Examples include guidelines for the design of parking lots,  streetscapes, building facades, storm water ponds, heritage  districts and public squares. A combination of text and  photographs, sketches and architectural drawings describe  preferred designs.  Municipalities often develop these publications as  supplementary educational tools to help developers, design  professionals (such as architects, landscape architects,  engineers and planners) or the general public to improve  upon existing design and construction practices. They  also illustrate various ways in which developers may meet  required municipal or provincial development standards.  Some municipalities require that developers comply with  such design guidelines and demonstrate compliance during  the formal review of development proposals. The design of a community’s physical components – such  as parking lots, parks and roadways, drainage ditches or  a neighbourhood as a whole – can reduce or magnify  the impacts of climate change at the local scale.41,42  Good design can contribute to building resilience to  climate change at the local level.43 For example, selecting  appropriate building materials and landscaping can reduce  the risk of wildfires. Although many municipalities have  developed design guidelines without climate change in  mind, their use can improve resilience to the impacts  of climate change. Conversely, design guidelines may  recommend or impose development standards that may  inadvertently decrease resilience to climate change. For  example, a municipality may prescribe building wide roads  to accommodate emergency vehicles. However, those wide  roads may also increase storm water volumes and magnify  the urban heat island effect. Regina’s Xeriscape Workbook44 Regina, Saskatchewan (population 193 100), is situated in the middle of the southern prairies, the driest major  region of Canada. The city has very little local access to water. For the Canadian prairies, increases in water scarcity  and drought are one of the most serious risks presented by climate change.  Xeriscape is an alternate form of landscaping that relies on drought-tolerant plants to reduce outdoor watering  requirements during the summer. In 1993, the City of Regina produced the Xeriscape Workbook, which provides  practical guidelines for low-water, low-maintenance landscaping. The Workbook is distributed at free workshops in  the spring and fall and on the   City’s Web site. In the late 1990s,   the City partnered with a local school  to create a xeriscape educational  and demonstration site. The garden  features 45 plant types, a false creek  and an amphitheatre with a teacher’s  rock for outdoor classes and lessons.  Climate change was not a consideration  when the City first developed the  Workbook. However, the application  of the landscaping practices within  the Workbook helps reduce water  consumption, an important climate  change adaptation\\xa0action.

Traditionally, parking lot design  has been based mainly on functional criteria (to maximize parking lot spaces and minimize maintenance costs)  with little regard to the quality of the urban design or environmental performance. The new guidelines provide  design options and strategies, in both graphic and written form, to meet the following objectives: enhance the  safety and attractiveness of the public realm, provide shade and high-quality landscaping, reduce the urban  heat island effect, manage storm-water quality and quantity on-site, and incorporate sustainable material and  technologies. All proposals for new parking lots within city limits, both public and private, must consider the  guidelines before receiving development approval. The guidelines also help developers comply with the Toronto  Green Standard. Although not designed explicitly as a climate change adaptation measure, the application of the  guidelines, particularly the urban heat island and storm-water management measures, increase the city’s resilience  to climate\\xa0change.

Climate change in this region is expected to cause a rise in  coastal water levels, more intense precipitation and storm events, and more significant coastal and inland erosion  and\\xa0flooding.48 The Saint John Waterfront Development Corporation, on behalf of the City, plans to redevelop 2.43 ha of land  on the waterfront. The street grid is to be extended, buildings renovated and new residences, shops and a hotel  constructed. A portion of the development site was formerly a Canadian Coast Guard base and is owned by  Fisheries and Oceans Canada. Accordingly, the transfer of the property to the Corporation requires a screening  under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act.49 The EA screening, completed in March of 2010, included  consideration of the potential impacts of climate change and sea level rise on the project.50 The Corporation  agreed to ensure that the climate and potential sea level rise are considered where relevant in the design of the  infrastructure components of the project. The loadings and stresses associated with climate change, potential sea  level rise and other environmental forces are to be addressed through engineering design as the planning for the  project continues.  P H O T O  C O U R T E S Y  O F  M A C  M A R O O N An environmental assessment (EA) is a structured process  used by governments to evaluate the environmental, social  and economic impacts of development. It can be applied  to a specific project, such as the construction of a bridge  or to a plan or policy intended to guide future projects.  Many kinds of developments are required to undergo  an EA. For instance, federal and provincial law may  require EAs for major industrial projects, projects that use  federal or provincial funds or for development on crown  lands.46 Some municipal infrastructure projects such as  extensions of sewers and the construction of water mains,  roads and transit systems may be subject to provincial  EA requirements. In 2003, the Canadian Environmental  Assessment Agency issued guidelines for incorporating  climate change considerations in EAs, one of the first  federal agencies in the world to do so.47  In addition, municipalities can require formal environmental  reviews, sometimes called environmental impact studies  (EISs), as part of the local process for the evaluation of  development proposals. For example, developers may be  required to submit an EIS for plans of a subdivision or for  a building project located in or near sensitive or protected  areas. The scope and process for a particular EIS will  vary depending on the nature of the project, applicable  environmental and planning laws, policies in the official  community plan and municipal bylaws, and the resources  available to local authorities.  EAs, EISs and other forms of environmental review have  proven to be ready platforms for consideration of climate  change concerns. The applicable legislation and guidelines  for EAs and EISs may require that local climate change be  incorporated as one aspect of the natural environment to  be considered and that measures to address climate change  impacts be incorporated into the project’s design and  management plan. In other cases, climate change impacts  may not be a direct consideration in the EA process.  Despite this, measures enacted in response to the EA may  help build resilience to a changing climate.

Climate change is expected to  bring Ajax more frequent and more severe extreme weather. This, plus proposed urbanization in the region, could  increase local risks such as flooding, fouled beaches and decreased water quality in Lake Ontario, the primary  source of water for Ajax.51  Ajax proactively uses EAs and EISs in its efforts to address climate change concerns. For example, to improve the  quality of water discharged into Lake Ontario, Ajax is developing a master plan for the retrofit of its storm-water  system. As part of that process, the Town conducted a Municipal Engineers Class EA to evaluate various retrofit  measures.52 The EA recommended a two-stage action plan involving (1) adopting “Healthy Community Practices,”  such as more strategic street sweeping practices, low-impact development approaches, community education  programs and ongoing storm-water quality monitoring; and (2) using results from the monitoring program to  determine whether engineered measures, such as retrofits to sewers, trenches and channel expansions, are needed.  Further, pursuant to environmental and climate change adaptation policies in its Official Plan, Ajax requires that  an EIS be submitted with all applications for developments on land designated as a natural heritage or hydrologic  features of provincial, regional or local significance. The EIS must evaluate adverse impacts of the proposed  development and establish appropriate actions to address those impacts.

This section  describes five decision-support tools that are particularly  relevant to planners and local officials involved in the  preparation and implementation of plans and measures  that address climate change adaptation. Many of the tools  described here help planners to translate scientific findings  about climate change into a language and format that is  suitable for making decisions about adaptation.

L A N D  U S E  P L A N N I N G  T O O L S  |  19  One of the first steps in the local adaptation planning  process is an assessment of how climate change affects  a community. Assessments can take several forms.i Some  emphasize projections of climate change impacts in  the community, while others focus on the factors that  produce local vulnerability and constrain the ability of the  community to take adaptive actions. The knowledge gained  through vulnerability and risk assessments can help decision  makers develop effective adaptation measures.  Many guidelines and frameworks have been developed  to help communities undertake local climate change  assessments.57 Some are generic tools that may apply  generally to all communities, while others are targeted  to certain types of communities (for example, rural  communities) or particular forms of climate change impacts  (for example, heat-related health risks). Many forms of  knowledge, including scientific and technical expertise and  local and traditional knowledge, can contribute to local  assessments of climate change impacts and adaptation.  VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENTS  A vulnerability assessment is a structured process for  identifying the vulnerability of human and natural systems  to climate change.58 The more exposed and sensitive an  individual or community is to climate change, the higher  its vulnerability. Vulnerability is also a function of adaptive  capacity; the higher a community’s capacity to undertake  adaptive actions, the less vulnerable it is.  When conducting a vulnerability assessment, a broad  range of socio-economic and physical factors should be  considered, including climate conditions, the adequacy of  housing and local infrastructure, the quality of emergency  response systems and assistance networks, the availability  P H O T O  C O U R T E S Y  O F  J E R R Y  M O U L A N D i The IPCC56 described several distinct conceptual frameworks for assessments of local climate change, including impact-based approaches that are climate scenario driven, adaptation-based  approaches that focus on the capacity of communities and natural systems to respond effectively to stress, vulnerability-based approaches centered on the factors driving the susceptibility  of individuals and groups to harm, integrated approaches that include modelling and other procedures for investigating climate change across sectors and scales and risk management  approaches that focus directly on decision making. of material and financial resources, and the general health  and risk awareness of the population.59,60 Consultation with  local stakeholders and residents is crucial in assessments,  both to understand existing vulnerabilities and to develop  effective strategies to reduce them. The information gained  from vulnerability assessments allows local officials to  develop appropriate interventions such as improved health  services, better access to transportation networks, and  healthier buildings and urban spaces. The assessments also  help to prioritize measures to assist the most vulnerable  individuals and groups in a timely and cost-effective manner.  RISK MANAGEMENT Risk management is a process widely used by businesses,  governments and non-governmental organizations to  identify and manage the adverse impacts of a change  in conditions. The magnitude of a risk is calculated by  examining the probability of the occurrence of an event and  the severity of its impact. Risk management helps decision  makers evaluate multiple threats and prioritize policy  responses under conditions of uncertainty.  Risk management processes can be used by a community  to evaluate risks associated with climate change and  suggest adaptation measures. Risk management  methodologies can provide a way to explore public  attitudes and perceptions of risk, and this information can  feed back into the assessment. The evaluation process  may be formal or informal and may be quantitative  or qualitative, depending on what works best for the  municipality. In addition to common risk management  processes (for example, ISO31000, CSA Q850), which can  be used to assess climate change risks, several climate  change-specific risk assessment tools have been developed  to assist Canadian communities (see Appendix A).  3.1  ASSESSMENTS OF COMMUNITY VULNERABILITY  AND RISK  20 |  L A N D  U S E  P L A N N I N G  T O O L S Heat and health vulnerability assessment in Windsor, Ontario Windsor (population 210 891) is Canada’s most southerly city and has summertime temperatures that are among  the highest in Canada.61 Climate change is expected to significantly increase the number of extreme heat days  annually in the region. This may exacerbate the risk of heat-related illness and deaths, particularly among seniors,  the chronically ill and other vulnerable groups.  Windsor was one of four pilot communities in a Health Canada project to develop community-based Heat Alert  and Response Systems (HARSs) to alert local residents when extreme temperatures pose a serious health concern  and to activate a coordinated public health response. The City of Windsor and Health Canada collaborated to  conduct a heat-health vulnerability assessment to help strengthen the design of the HARS as well as to engage  important stakeholders. The vulnerability assessment proceeded in five steps:62 (1) an initial assessment of the  scope, objectives, work plan and stakeholders involved; (2) the collection and analysis of data, including an  examination of the relationship between temperature and mortality; (3) the projection of future climate for the  Windsor region; (4) a literature review to provide background information about the impacts of heat on health,  vulnerability assessment methods, and best adaptation practices; and (5) workshops to consult with stakeholders  and the community about existing vulnerabilities, adaptive capacity and potential adaptation actions. The  vulnerability assessment provided information that allowed public health officials to develop more effective  adaptation interventions.63  P H O T O  C O U R T E S Y  O F  T O U R IS M   W IN D S O R  E S S E X  P E L E E  I S L A N D  L A N D  U S E  P L A N N I N G  T O O L S  |  21  Dawson Climate Change Risk Evaluation64 Dawson City, Yukon (population 1350), is located just below the Arctic Circle at 64°N. In 2007, Dawson partnered  with a local non-profit organization, the Northern Climate ExChange, to develop a community adaptation plan.   An evaluation of climate change-related risks was an important component of the planning process.  Public consultations were undertaken to identify community vulnerabilities and potential opportunities arising   from climate change. The project team and a local advisory committee distilled community issues into a list of   78 “community consequences” of climate change. For each of those, risk evaluation tables were completed jointly  by the project team and the advisory committee. An overall priority level (low, medium and high) for each impact  was established through consideration of the severity and likelihood of a particular impact and the capacity of the  community to take action to address it. Suggested adaptation actions were formulated for all consequences, and  one or more partner organizations (for example, Yukon government and Dawson City council) were identified to  provide leadership. See the framework example, in this case used to analyse agriculture/urban land-use conflicts.

Examples include changes in average and extreme  precipitation and temperature, the number of frost-free  days, sea level, and the length of the growing season.   This information may be presented in numerical, visual  (graphs or maps) or narrative form.  Climate projections are generated from the outputs of  one or more climate models. These models are complex  computer programs that simulate the behaviour of the  atmosphere, the oceans, land surfaces, clouds and other  key components of the climate system.67 The models depict  future conditions at different scales – some encompass  the entire globe while others focus on specific regions.  Generally, uncertainty increases at the finer spatial  scales. To examine future climates, models incorporate  assumptions about greenhouse gas emissions in the  future. For example, some assume fast-rising emissions  while others assume more gradual growth and eventual  reductions in emissions. Uncertainty is an inherent part of  all climate projections, owing to challenges in modelling  complex climate systems and in foreseeing future global  actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Climate change projections may be applied to local  planning processes in various ways, including the following: •  as tools for learning and public engagement.  Planners may present climate projections to  stakeholders and the public to raise awareness  about the nature and magnitude of possible changes  to the local climate, thus stimulating discussion  amongst stakeholders about potential impacts,  local vulnerabilities, adaptive capacity and preferred  approaches to adaptation. •  as part of assessments of community  vulnerabilities and risks. In formulating adaptation  plans, communities often utilize climate projections  when studying the nature and extent of local risk  and vulnerabilities, including the capacity of key  stakeholders and residents to cope with and respond  effectively to increased stress.  •  as parameters for setting the design tolerance  of systems and structures. For example, a  municipality may, based on projected changes in the  intensity of future rainfall events, change the design  criteria for the diameter of storm-water pipes to  accommodate greater flows. Although projections are a useful decision-support tool,  there are adaptation measures that communities can take  without having to use or commission climate projections.  Communities can, for example, base their adaptation  planning decisions on an analysis of current vulnerabilities  or on information gleaned from reliable regional, national  or international assessments (which make use of climate  projections). It is important that planners are cognizant of  the inherent uncertainties embedded in projections and  communicate them accurately to decision makers and  the\\xa0public.   L A N D  U S E  P L A N N I N G  T O O L S  |  23  Halifax Harbour plan for sea level rise68,69 Halifax (population 390 000), the capital of Nova Scotia, is a major seaport with significant industrial, military and  municipal infrastructure on the coast. Rising sea level, along with increased storm intensity and associated waves  and storm surges, presents risks to residents, property and infrastructure in coastal areas of the city. To respond  to these impacts, in 2006 the city recognized the need to gather scientific data on sea level rise, storm surges and  vulnerability to inform development of an area-specific land use plan for Halifax Harbour. City planners partnered with a team of scientists to develop projections of future sea levels and storm water levels  in Halifax Harbour under three climate scenarios for 2100: (1) a continuation of the historical rate of change, (2) the  upper-limit projection for mean sea level rise from the fourth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel  on Climate Change (IPCC) and (3) a projection based on more recent scientific literature. High-resolution mapping  of possible future flood levels was then produced for each scenario. Following a presentation by scientists and  city staff, Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM) Council in 2010 chose scenario 2c as a policy reference point from  which to develop the adaptation strategy. HRM is also committed to re-examining this choice when additional  scientific information becomes available. This example demonstrates that credible climate projections, based  on best available science that are communicated to the public and decision makers in a format that is easily  understandable, provide a helpful foundation for adaptation action at the municipal level.

Flooding and the devastation of the region’s forests by the mountain pine beetle are  the climate-related impacts of greatest concern to the community. In 2008, the City partnered with the University of  Northern British Columbia (UNBC)70 to mainstream climate change adaptation into the city’s policies and programs. The City and UNBC partnered with the Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium at the University of Victoria to produce  a climate trends and projections report specific to the Prince George region.71 The report assessed historical  trends (1918 to 2006) for precipitation, temperature and stream flow as well as projected changes (for the 2020s,  2050s and 2080s) in temperature and precipitation using global climate models. UNBC and the City organized  two adaptation workshops and other information events that brought together city staff, the public and key  stakeholders to discuss approaches to dealing with climate change impacts. Climate experts from PCIC presented  a summary of the projections at the workshops. Participants were asked to discuss the potential social, economic  and environmental implications of the projected changes for Prince George and define key impacts for the city. The  climate change projections were a useful tool for establishing a credible baseline from which workshop participants  could engage and discuss impacts and adaptation actions. Prince George has since integrated the findings from the  workshops, including recommended measures to reduce risks from forest fires and flooding, into the Integrated  Community Sustainability Plan72 and draft Official Community Plan.

To help the community prepare for  future climate changes, a scenario planning project was conducted in 2009, led by a local college in collaboration  with the territorial government, local and First Nations governments, private sector firms and community groups.76,77  In a series of meetings, members of the community identified local vulnerabilities under four possible “future  histories” of Whitehorse. To create those histories, two climate change scenarios and two development scenarios  were generated. For instance, Scenario 4, entitled City of Crossroads, envisions a high degree of climate change  (median temperature rise of 4°C) as well as significant population growth (24 000 new residents). The other future  histories have different assumptions regarding climate change and development. Participants brainstormed on the  social, economic and environmental consequences associated with each scenario. Certain impacts or concerns  that were common across the four histories were deemed to be consequences most likely to occur and therefore  became priorities for developing adaptation actions. The priorities included increased risk of forest fire, shifts in the  availability of water, infrastructure decline, energy and food security, and potential land use conflicts. The study  also allowed planners to identify the range of impacts that any one adaptation measure could address and how  these measures may fit with other planning initiatives.  Climate changes (e.g. extent of temperature   rise and increase in snow) some climate change lots of climate change Development trajectory  (e.g. population growth) low Scenario 1:   City of Wilderness Scenario 2:   City of People high Scenario 3:   City of Mettle Scenario 4:   City of Crossroads A scenario is a plausible, simplified description of  how the future may develop. Scenario planning is a  strategic medium- to long-term planning tool in which  planners develop multiple scenarios describing potential  social, economic and environmental conditions in a  community and then formulate strategies and measures  to achieve planning goals under one or more of those  scenarios.73 Long used by government and the private  sector for managing uncertainty, scenario planning is  now being applied by some communities to prepare for  climate\\xa0change. In planning for adaptation to climate change, planners  devise scenarios that demonstrate how changes in climate  may affect the community under different development  trajectories (see the diagram in the following Whitehorse  example). The development trajectories are based on a few  key variables expected to drive change, such as population  growth, technological shifts or energy demand. Different  narratives about how climate change may unfold in the  community are derived from scientific projections, expert  assessments and other sources.74 Planning scenarios assist adaptation planning and policy- making in several ways. The process of constructing the  scenarios educates stakeholders about the nature and  extent of future climate-related risks and opportunities.  Scenarios may provide information that helps to identify  emerging vulnerabilities (for example, potential conflict  over access to water) and support efforts to prioritize  climate change risks. They also assist in devising adaptation  strategies and actions to address vulnerabilities. The  most robust measures are those effective across different  scenarios. For example, in communities at risk from  wildfires, proper firebreak maintenance can be a useful  adaptation measure regardless of the magnitude of climate  change experienced and the rate of development. In  other cases, planners may develop contingent adaptation  strategies that would be implemented in the event a  particular scenario begins to unfold.75  26 |  L A N D  U S E  P L A N N I N G  T O O L S 3.4 VISUALIZING CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS Toronto’s heat vulnerability mapping tool79 As the climate changes, Toronto is expected to  experience more intense and prolonged heat  waves. Extreme heat is a public health issue of  particular concern to the city’s senior citizens, to  persons suffering from respiratory illnesses and to  other vulnerable populations. Toronto Public Health  (TPH) has developed a mapping tool to visualize  areas of elevated human vulnerability to extreme  heat. The maps incorporate numerous indicators of  vulnerability, including surface temperatures, green  space coverage, housing and social characteristics  of at-risk populations, access to air conditioning,  and the location of cool places. The tool helps TPH  and community partners identify and prioritize  geographic hot spots for delivering resources during  a heat alert. The City also plans to use the tool for  long-term climate adaptation planning.  Maps and other landscape visualizations can illustrate, in  a simple and effective manner,78 the nature and extent of  the changes expected in the local climate, the severity of  possible impacts, and what proposed adaptation responses  might look like. Such visualizations support decision making  by translating scientific concepts into maps or images  that have clear and practical meaning to non-scientists  and the public. They can facilitate dialogue during the  planning\\xa0process. MAPS Maps are one of the most common adaptation decision- support tools used by planners. They can range from  simple hand-drawn maps to those developed by using  sophisticated computer software. Maps have been used  to identify geographic areas of the municipality at risk  from climate-related impacts, the location of vulnerable  infrastructure and populations, or to demarcate places  where certain adaptation-related policies apply. For  example, the potential extent of shoreline erosion or storm  surge flooding under various climate change scenarios  can be mapped. Maps can also be readily referenced or  incorporated into land use planning tools, such as zoning  bylaws, official plans and policy documents.  VISUALIZATIONS Increasingly, municipalities employ computer animation  software to create three-dimensional visualizations at the  street and neighbourhood scales. The software combines  images of the existing features of the community (for  example, roads, buildings and trees near the shore) with  climate-related impacts projected for the area (for example,  higher sea level). The animations help people visualize  the losses that may be incurred under such conditions  and illustrate the consequences of a particular adaptation  measure. For example, planners may want to create an  image showing how raising a dike or levee would affect  views of the ocean from various waterfront properties. The  resulting images may be useful in engaging the affected  land owners and the public when evaluating the merits of a  proposed adaptation measure, such as raising a sea dike.

The low-lying community is at risk of flooding from sea level rise and increased intensity and frequency of storm  surges.82 Since 2005, Delta has partnered with the Collaborative for Advanced Landscape Planning (CALP) at  the University of British Columbia (UBC) to develop visualizations of the flooding risk to Delta. CALP and UBC’s  Okanagan campus developed a 3D virtual environment where Delta residents could see what adaptation actions  would look like. For example, the following image shows a typical residential street inundated by flood waters  following a major storm surge event. Delta officials found the visualization process useful in engaging local  residents. Since the public consultations in 2007, Delta has integrated adaptation into various infrastructure and  operational decisions.   28 |  L A N D  U S E  P L A N N I N G  T O O L S 3.5 ADAPTATION PLANNING GUIDEBOOKS Windsor’s Climate Change Adaptation Plan Windsor (population 216 000) is located in southwestern Ontario on the south shore of the Detroit River and Lake  St. Clair. Climate change impacts of concern include an expected increase in the frequency and intensity of heavy  rain storms and heat waves (a doubling of the number of 30°C days has been projected by 2050).83 These changes  could pose serious problems for the city. In 2010, for example, a significant rainstorm that delivered 90 mm of rain  in a 24-hour period led to widespread basement flooding throughout the city.84 Windsor began developing its adaptation plan in 2010. The City is working through the five-step adaptation  planning process outlined in Changing Climate, Changing Communities, a guidebook published by ICLEI Canada.85  The steps are initiate, research, plan, implement and monitor. The City is midway through that planning process.  The development of Windsor’s adaptation plan builds on existing initiatives, including a heat alert and emergency  response system, the expansion of a waste water treatment facility, various initiatives aimed at reducing basement  flooding, and the construction of a new retention treatment basin to reduce combined sewer overflows. City officials  intend to integrate the actions identified in the adaptation plan into existing policies, programs and operations. P H O T O  C O U R T E S Y  O F  T O U R IS M  W IN D SO R  E SS E X  P E LE E  I SL A N D Several Canadian guidebooks have been produced that  describe the steps a community can take to formulate  an adaptation strategy and action plan (see Appendix B).  Several of these guidebooks outline a standard planning  process that is then tailored with information that is  relevant to preparing for the impacts of climate change.  The guidebooks are typically based on the experience and  insights of pilot communities and may include case studies  and prepared worksheets, as well as tips and practical  information. The other decision-support tools described in  this document – visualizations, vulnerability and risk assess- ments, and scenario planning – may be included within the  adaptation planning process described in the guidebooks.   L A N D  U S E  P L A N N I N G  T O O L S  |  29  Nova Scotia’s Municipal Climate Change Action Plan Guidebook: Yarmouth  pilot\\xa0project  The Town of Yarmouth (population 6761) is on the  Gulf of Maine in southwestern Nova Scotia. The town  is vulnerable to sea level rise and storm surge flooding.  In 2010, the Government of Nova Scotia required  municipalities to prepare and submit a climate change  action plan by 2013 as a condition for receiving federal  gas-tax funds. In November 2011, the Province published  the Municipal Climate Change Action Plan Guidebook  to help municipalities prepare their action plans.86  Yarmouth was one of three pilot communities to work  through the Guidebook. The lessons learned were used  to assist other municipalities in undertaking similar  initiatives. Yarmouth is developing a long-term strategic approach  for managing climate change hazards. Between October  2011 and February 2012, with assistance from the  Dalhousie School of Planning, Yarmouth worked through the six steps in the Guidebook. Before submitting its  Plan to the Province in 2013, the Town intends to host a public consultation session and continue to refine its  Action Plan. Despite some challenges, town staff found it to be a useful process. In particular, the formation of  the steering committee, composed of staff from different departments, has allowed colleagues to work together  across functional areas.  Steps to develop an action plan 1. Build an adaptation team/committee.  2. Assess impacts and hazards. 3. Identify affected locations. 4. Identify and evaluate the impacts to  affected facilities, infrastructure and  services.  5. Identify local social, economic and  environment considerations.  6. Determine priorities for adaptive actions. P H O T O  C O U R T E S Y  O F  M IC H A E L  B L A S E R  30 |  L A N D  U S E  P L A N N I N G  T O O L S Appendix A  Provincial and territorial role in local adaptation planning PROVINCES Under the Canadian constitution, provinces have jurisdiction  over many matters of local concern including land use  planning.87,88 Accordingly, Provinces play a role in land use  planning for local adaptation to climate change through  •  enabling legislation – Provinces enact and revise  laws that guide planning by local and regional  authorities. Those laws establish the regulatory and  policy tools that control land use at the local level  and define how and when they may be used. For  example, provincial planning acts prescribe the kinds  of zoning bylaws a municipality may adopt. The  provinces define the suite of tools available to local  government to design and implement adaptation  plans and measures. •  provincial planning policies – Provinces adopt  regulations and policies, to which local and regional  plans generally must conform, on planning issues  of concern across the province. Those policies may  address topics relevant to local adaptation efforts. For  instance, a province may prescribe planning standards  designed to protect agricultural land and contain  urbanization at the fringes of a metropolitan area.  Those standards may facilitate enhanced regional  food security and the design of more resilient urban  communities. •  provincial adaptation plans and programs –  Many provinces have their own formal plans for  adapting to climate change. Typically, such plans  specify provincial goals and objectives; identify the  impacts of climate change on government programs,  operations and infrastructure; and suggest specific  actions. For example, a plan may call for more high- definition aerial mapping or enhanced monitoring of  water quality. Provinces also disseminate guidelines  and technical information and can act as facilitators  and conveners to assist local governments, the private  sector and civic organizations in adapting to climate  change. Finally, provinces fund programs that can  support local adaptation (for example, subsidies for  an urban tree planting program to reduce the urban  heat island effect).  •  direct involvement in development decisions\\xa0–  In most local planning matters, the provincial  government plays an indirect, oversight role (for  instance, as appellate bodies on a zoning dispute  or as the final approving authority on local official  plans). In some circumstances, provincial officials  are directly involved in local development decisions.  This may be the case for sites and issues that fall  under direct provincial jurisdiction, such as highway  construction, unincorporated communities, local  projects on crown land, projects affecting heritage  properties, and environmental assessments of large  infrastructure projects. In such cases, provincial  officials may contribute directly to decisions on the  design and implementation of local adaptation  measures. •  intergovernmental relations – Provinces negotiate  agreements, collaborate on programs and projects,  and manage their relations with other provinces  and the federal government. In that capacity, a  province can help set the conditions for participation  by local governments in programs that support or  complement adaptation. An example is the set of  agreements between the Government of Canada and  various provinces governing the allocation of federal  gas-tax funds.  The nature and extent of provincial involvement in local  adaptation planning varies between provinces, depending  on legal and institutional frameworks, the planning culture  and practice of each location, and many other factors. TERRITORIES Like provincial governments, the governments of the  territories of Nunavut, the Northwest Territories and  Yukon have jurisdiction over land use planning and many  other local matters. However, these legislative powers do  not spring directly from the Constitution but instead are  delegated to the territories by the Government of Canada  under various laws.89,90,91 Territorial governments in turn  enact legislation and adopt policies to guide planning by  local and regional authorities within their borders.92,93  L A N D  U S E  P L A N N I N G  T O O L S  |  31  While the legal framework for land use planning in the  territories differs from that in the provinces, the roles  that territorial governments play in adaptation to climate  change roughly correspond to those described in the  Provinces section of this appendix. For example, territorial  governments also adopt climate change strategies and  actions plans.94,95,96 Territorial land-use planning practices  and territorial government involvement in local adaptation  planning vary by territory, depending on the enabling  federal legislation and other factors. British Columbia’s Climate Action Plan97 British Columbia released its Climate Action Plan in June 2008. Chapter 5 describes the Province’s vision, strategies  and activities as it prepares for climate change. In responding to the increased likelihood of severe weather events,  the provincial government is taking action to (1) ensure that new development on flood plains will be flood-proofed  to provincial standards, (2) consider the impacts of climate change when awarding provincial infrastructure grants,  (3) develop a comprehensive plan for green community development and (4) ensure that community development  strategies recognize the importance of streams and rivers. The Province is currently updating its planning policy  statements and guidelines, including the Guidelines for Management of Coastal Flood Hazard Land Use. The  Guidelines describe new land use tools that local governments may adopt, including sea level rise planning areas and  risk-based zoning.98  Prince Edward Island’s Climate Change Strategy99 Prince Edward Island’s Climate Change Strategy outlines measures to both reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to  deal with the impacts of climate change. The strategy adopts a risk-based approach to adaptation as it “is the most  practical way to ensure that adaptation responses are socially acceptable, cost-effective and consistent with the  community’s wider social, environmental and economic goals.” The impacts of climate change on coasts – such as sea  level rise, increased storm surge flooding and erosion – are highlighted as issues of concern. The strategy identifies  five overarching adaptation objectives and actions, all of which have direct implications at the municipal level. For  example, the Province committed to reviewing all provincial land use and development policies to encourage more  sustainable options for future land development and to better adapt to changing climate conditions. Manitoba’s Provincial Planning Regulation  Manitoba’s Provincial Planning Regulation100 (the Regulation) identifies both climate change mitigation and adaptation  as strategic priorities, along with other key concerns such as clean water and public safety. Community resilience is  recognized as a key principle of sound land use planning.  The Regulation identifies issues of provincial interest to be addressed in local development plans and goals to be  pursued in various policy areas. For instance, with respect to general development policy, the provincial interest  includes directing development toward areas where risk can be minimized and taking into account climate change  vulnerabilities. With regard to water, provincial interest includes the development of strategies to prioritize allocation  and implementation of conservation measures to build community resilience. The Regulation prohibits certain kinds of  development in or near water bodies and prescribes minimum setbacks for new development. The policy on planning  for agriculture recognizes the potential increased demand for food production in response to climate change and  encourages local authorities to promote food security. At a strategic level, the Regulation requires that each local  planning authority assess local vulnerabilities to climate change and consider existing climate change action plans  when preparing, amending or replacing the local development plan.   32 |  L A N D  U S E  P L A N N I N G  T O O L S Appendix B  Additional resources on select decision-support tools VISUALIZING CLIMATE  CHANGE\\xa0IMPACTS Local Climate Change Visioning and Landscape  Visualizations: Guidance Manual (2010).
