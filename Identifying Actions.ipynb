Guidelines for Sea Dikes and Coastal Flood Hazard Land Use 1 1.1 Introduction and Application of This Document General This document provides guidelines for the management of lands that are exposed to coastal flood hazards arising from their exposure to the sea and to expected sea level rise due to climate change.\n","8:  This document will supersede the related sections of the existing _Land Use Guidelines 2004_, which means the Flood Hazard Area Land Use Management Guidelines, May 2004, prepared by the Ministry of Water, Land and Air Protection (now Ministry of Environment).\n","15:  The relaxed flood-proofing must be compatible with the design of the sea dikes.\n","19:  Analysis of flooding hazards from all sources _ rivers and the sea - will be required in estuaries.\n","21:  1 Draft Policy Discussion Paper - Climate Change Adaptation Guidelines for Sea Dikes and Coastal Flood Hazard Land Use in BC.\n","23:  2 Sea Dike Guidelines - Climate Change Adaptation Guidelines for Sea Dikes and Coastal Flood Hazard Land Use in BC.\n","37:  The reference point can be estimated by defining: 1.\n","53:  To protect the large investment that buildings involve, and respecting current trends in SLR, a precautionary principle is followed to create the Recommended Curve for Sea Level Rise Policy in BC.\n","59:  Building Life Cycle and Sea Level Rise 3.2 In considering FCL in the face of an evolving sea level, it is necessary to consider the longevity of the buildings, structures or land use under consideration.\n","65:  This guideline should apply for the period from 2010 until the next SLR review, which should be completed by 2015.\n","68:  crustal uplift or subsidence) could be required.\n","79:  It should be noted that these preliminary values should vary due to a number of factors that are site specific, including: the local rate of crustal uplift or subsidence, the nature of the tides, anticipated local storm surge effects that depend on local bathymetry and the particulars of the anticipated storms associated with the storm surge.\n","82:  SLR Planning Areas should be established along the BC Coast to provide a basis for local calculations and guidance on required Flood Construction Levels, and to provide a basis for management of the expected ongoing increases in SLR as it affects land use and buildings.\n","92:  Land use and building approvals based on FCL for 2100 should also include provisions for adaptive management of land uses to Sea Level Rise to the Year 2200 and beyond.\n","94:  An Adaptive Risk Management Approach to SLR would plan how short term land uses and structures can be occupied with reasonable risk for their lifespan, but at the same time recognize and allow that future SLR may require the redesign to a higher elevation or relocation of the next generation of land uses and structures at a given coastal site.\n","96:  For example, a building constructed in 2010 with a 90 year lifespan would meet the guideline if sited to allow for SLR of 1.0 m minimum over Year 2000 levels plus or minus any regional adjustments.\n","98:  The actual required FCL in the year 2200 will not be known with accuracy until much closer to that date.\n","100:  This approach will minimize the initial costs of considering SLR, and the future costs of adaptation.\n","104:  SLR Planning Areas should be defined for both settled and new development areas that are at risk of SLR inundation or related erosion.\n","106:  Figure 4-1 illustrates in concept the proposed SLR Planning Areas.\n","107:  They would extend from the existing Natural Boundary of the sea landward to the contour elevation of a future Flood Construction Level (FCL).\n","109:  _ SLR Planning Area Year 2200 would extend from Natural Boundary at the sea to the guideline FCL elevation projected for Year 2200.\n","112:  Land use policies must then address the land needs required to upgrade the existing sea dikes.\n","114:  Each location may have a different allowance for High Tide, Sea Level Rise, Storm Surge, and Wave Effects which together with Freeboard determine the FCL.\n","115:  Planning policy and land use designations within the SLR Planning Area must consider how land uses can adapt to the projected future Flood Construction Levels.\n","124:  Some building uses may have a lifespan of shorter than 100 years.\n","128:  The guidelines and requirements in SLR Planning Areas will need to be reviewed in these same intervals, with a focus on updating FCL elevation requirements, which may move up or down as projections for SLR become more accurate.\n","129:  The term of SLR Plans will also move with the review intervals _ with the general intent that SLR planning looks ahead approximately 100 and 200 years from the date of the plan.\n","131:  Building Setbacks from the Sea In un-diked areas, SLR will have the long-term effect of moving the Natural Boundary landward.\n","132:  This effect will be more pronounced on gently sloping shorelines or low coastal benches than in steeper shoreline terrain or where bedrock is present.\n","133:  Coastal Bluffs will require special consideration.\n","134:  Sea Level Rise may increase the risk of coastal erosion and accelerate the retreat of shorelines.\n","137:  The rate of retreat will be highly dependent on the wind and wave characteristics at the site and the material of the shoreline and backshore bluffs.\n","138:  Where lands are to remain un-diked, setbacks for buildings from the sea must anticipate SLR for the lifespan of the building.\n","139:  Figure 4-4 illustrates SLR to the Year 2100 in a relatively flat and rolling shoreline condition.\n","142:  Building Setback should be established as _the greater of 15 m from the future Estimated Natural Boundary or a distance to where the native land elevation equals the Flood Construction Level_.\n","143:  This setback would apply to non-erodible bedrock cliffs as well as other shoreline types.\n","148:  Rebuilding on or after 2100 should undertake a MANAGED RETREAT, and respect the Year 2200 FCL and Setback.\n","150:  Short of relocating the building, preparing the lower parts of the building to ACCOMODATE flooding from the sea should be required _ through such measures as leaving only floodable uses such as parking on the lower floor, moving habitable quarters to the upper floor, or using water resistant materials on the lower floor.\n","152:  During planning for land use and development, careful mapping and planning strategies for SLR Planning Areas will minimize costs and hazards for both the public and private landowners / insurers.\n","154:  Where shorelines are relatively steep and rocky, typical of bedrock points of land, the minimum 15m setback combined with a steep slope would mean the areal extent of SLR will be limited.\n","159:  An initial response should be to concentrate development outside the SLR Planning Area, to AVOID risks associated with SLR.\n","161:  Land use in the area that will be inundated in the future should be managed to adjust to the change in shoreline and to the increased risk of sea flooding during the Designated Storm.\n","162:  Uses such as agriculture, parks, open space and limited industrial or short-term uses would be preferred.\n","165:  SLR Planning should consider what areas of land should be set aside to allow migration of coastal ecosystems, or to support ecosystem restoration or habitat banking.\n","166:  SLR Planning Areas, or applicant supported studies by Qualified Professionals, should also be used to customize building _setback_ based on coastal risk assessments that consider how SLR combined with wave action and coastal geomorphology may alter shoreline locations, shape and backshore erosion.\n","167:  Guidelines for location of buildings should be based on these planning studies and the expected life of the at-risk asset.\n","169:  SLR Planning should consider how to mitigate the impacts of salinization.\n","176:  Associated with the planned structure lifespan would be a FCL and shoreline setback.\n","177:  A covenant on title would provide legal notice that the FCL and setback rules may change for reconstruction at the end of the structure lifespan period.\n","182:  This would be an interim measure only until more cost-efficient neighbourhood scale SLR Planning could be done.\n","186:  : SLR Planning Areas for Year 2200 _ Not usually necessary to consider flood risk unless local conditions indicate otherwise.\n","187:  Suitable for development other than essential services.\n","188:  _ A flood risk assessment may be required at upper end of the probability range (0.5% or 200 year average return period) or where the nature of the development or the local circumstances indicates heightened risk.\n","189:  Water-resistant materials and construction may be required.\n","190:  _ Generally not suitable for essential civil infrastructure/services such as hospitals, fire stations, emergency depots.\n","193:  : SLR Planning Areas for Year 2100 _ Generally not suitable for essential infrastructure such as hospitals, fire stations, emergency depots, schools, ground-based electrical and telecommunications equipment.\n","194:  Flood proofing may be acceptable.\n","196:  In allocating sites, preference should be given to those areas already defended to that standard.\n","197:  Use water-resistant materials and construction as appropriate.\n","198:  In undeveloped and sparsely populated areas: Generally not suitable for additional development of any type.\n","200:  Such infrastructure should be designed and constructed to remain operational during floods.\n","201:  _ May be suitable for some recreation, sport, amenity and nature conservation uses provided adequate evacuation procedures are in place.\n","202:  Job-related accommodation (e.g., caretakers and operational staff) may be acceptable.\n","203:  New trailer or mobile home should generally not be located in these areas.\n","205:  Water-resistant materials and construction as appropriate.\n","206:  Land should not be developed if it will be needed or have significant potential for coastal managed realignment (retreat) or creation of wetlands as part of an overall flood defence.\n","211:  _ S 910 Flood Plain Bylaw _ OCP Development Permit Area for Protection of Development from Hazardous Conditions _ guidelines and requirements for developing in hazard areas.\n","212:  _ Restrictive covenants.\n","213:  _ Public education _ about the hazards and ways that individuals can address them.\n","218:  In areas protected by sea dikes that meet BCMOE requirements, FCLs may not apply and land use behind those sea dikes may not be restricted.\n","219:  Building setbacks will be required on the landside of dikes as needed for dike maintenance and to provide land for future dike raising and reconstruction.\n","220:  Sea Level Rise will create an increasing risk of periodic inundation to existing low lying undeveloped lands along the BC Coast and in lower reaches of river deltas near the Coast.\n","221:  These guidelines are not meant to preclude the use of these lands or of existing structures on these that development of new structures or redevelopment/replacement of existing structures recognizes and can appropriately accommodate the projected impacts of sea level rise on coastal hazards and flooding over time.\n","225:  Landfill or structural support (e.g.\n","226:  pilings) for a coastal development shall be treated as a Dike structure _ refer to the _Sea Dike Guidelines 2010_ for guidance.\n","228:  To regulate redevelopment at the end of the building lifespan, the development approving official shall require a restrictive covenant stipulation of reconstruction requirements to meet the FCL and setbacks in force at the time of redevelopment, and identifying the hazard, building requirements, and liability disclaimer if reconstruction does not take place at or before the planned lifespan of the building.\n","234:  The setback may be modified provided the modification is supported by a report, giving consideration to the coastal erosion that may occur over the life of the project, prepared by a suitably qualified professional.\n","236:  Land use specific provisions in the existing guidelines would still apply.\n","239:  Reconstruction of Existing Buildings Replacement or redevelopment of a building on an existing low lying lot must meet the new FCL and Setback guidelines.\n","240:  If meeting the new guidelines would sterilize the lot (i.e., not allow even one of the land uses or structures permitted under the current zoning), the development approving official may agree to modifying setback requirements as recommended by a Qualified Professional, provided this is augmented through a restrictive covenant stipulation of the hazard, building requirements, and liability disclaimer.\n","241:  Outside of the Strait of Georgia the requirements would be similar but adapted to include Tsunami considerations and a 30m minimum setback.\n","242:  Land Use Specific provisions in the existing guideline would still apply.\n","266:  In the case of a manufactured home, the ground level or top of concrete or asphalt pad, on which it is located, shall be equal to or higher than the above described elevation.\n","268:  Where the Designated Flood Level cannot be determined or where there are overriding factors, an assessed height above the natural boundary of the water-body or above the natural ground elevation may be used (as defined in the Land Use Guidelines 2004).\n","272:  1.9 Flood Plain A lowland area, whether diked, flood proofed, or not, which, by reasons of land elevation, is susceptible to flooding from an adjoining watercourse, ocean, lake or other body of water and for administration purposes is taken to be that area submerged at the Designated Flood Level.\n","274:  Special measures may be warranted in this area.\n","278:  In coastal areas exposed to flooding, construction of fill as a flood proofing measure may substantially increase the freeboard required to define the FCL, if the fill is directly exposed to the Designated Flood Level.\n","280:  Used to establish the Flood Construction Level.\n","291:  In the future the location and elevation of a Natural Boundary will change from time to time due to changes associated with sea level rise and it will likely lag sea level rise.\n","301:  used to protect land from flooding or inundation.\n","304:  In BC, multiple Diking Authorities may share responsibility for the same sea dike system.\n","316:  1.20 Setback Means withdrawal or siting of a building or landfill away from the natural boundary or other reference line to maintain a floodway and to allow for potential land erosion.\n","321:  1.23 Total Storm Surge The combination of the storm surge generated in deep water plus the additional local surge or wind setup generated by the effect of the winds during the Designated Storm over shallow Appendix A 5 water at a particular site.\n","323:  Additional surge may occur at other sites.\n","329:  Wave set-up will lead to larger waves existing at the seaward toe of a sea dike than might otherwise be expected.\n","331:  Water overtopping a sea dike may pass over the dike as a flow of water or as spray and the specific characteristics are site and structure specific.\n","333:  2 Acronyms and Symbols 2.1 CD Tide and chart datum _ in Canadian waters the plane below which the tide will seldom fall.\n","335:  For a site specific survey tide and chart (sounding) datum may be different and the specifics should be stated explicitly.\n","336:  2.2 CGD Canadian Geodetic Datum.\n","343:  Fundamental Concepts in BC Coastal Flood Hazard The existing document: Flood Hazard Area Land Use Guidelines 2004 was focussed on river flood risks.\n","344:  The section on flooding by the sea (Section 3.5) did not fully anticipate sea level rise and assumed a static sea level.\n","356:  _ Bedrock or designed shore protection might allow a reduced setback.\n","359:  from river estuaries, may have flooding hazards that are higher than the requirements for a hazard from the sea.\n","373:  (See Definitions in Appendix A).\n","374:  1 _Dike Design and Construction Guide _ Best Management Practices for British Columbia_, July 2003, published by the Province of British Columbia, Ministry of Water, Land and Air Protection (now the Ministry of Environment) Appendix B 3 Figure B3: Coastal Flood Hazard _ Adaptation for Climate Change Sea Level Rise will gradually raise both the mean sea level (MSL) and the tidal levels along the BC Coast.\n","375:  Both MSL and tidal levels will rise in approximately equal amounts in response to SLR.\n","378:  As sea level rises, the storms that occur will leave a mark on the slowly changing shoreline.\n","380:  The combination of antecedent storms and the Designated Storm will move the existing Natural Boundary landward to a new Natural Boundary location at the top of the wave affected zone.\n","385:  To calculate the FCL a Freeboard allowance is added above the Flood Construction Reference Plane (FCRP) to allow for uncertainty.\n","386:  This Freeboard allowance may include Appendix B 4 uncertainties in the future changes to storm surge, wave run-up, and the effects of sea level rise on delta flooding and coastal sediment supply.\n","394:  guidebook livia-rev-final:Layout 1 12/23/08 9:24 AM Page 1 CANADIAN COMMUNITIES_ GUIDEBOOK FOR ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE

development, zoning, changes in the use of agricultural land, green spaces and parks) and assessing them for their potential to address current and future challenges from climatic and non-climatic stresses, local vulnerabilities and adaptive capacities can be assessed.\n","731:  For example, to respond to flooding we could think of flood attenuation and storage; upstream land management; permanent flood defences including ring dikes around vulnerable areas; diversion of flood flows; setting back river edge flood defences to make space for water; changing the configuration of the coastline; green roofs; widening drains; managing flood pathways; raising floor levels; free-standing flood barriers; removable household products; and increasing habitable space.\n","737:  The completion of these actions will provide information about the state of local development, capacities and local vulnerability.\n","738:  To address them, a number of methods can be utilized.\n","740:  To do this, the project team could collaborate with researchers to help conduct the analyses and summarize the results.\n","741:  This exercise will help to determine capacities and applied principles, and scenarios in local planning.\n","743:  This could be used in the workshop setting to create a common ground for completing the list of actions.\n","744:  A project team should gather

values.\n","3267:  Lower water availability can also lead to higher costs of water, and restrictions on water use.\n","3280:  Drought management plans should be developed before conditions require their use.\n","3282:  Therefore, planning well in advance of a drought will allow more time for thoughtful, rational and comprehensive planning than when a community is already experiencing a drought situation.\n","3288:  As such, Water Use Plans can help resolve conflicts among competing water users.\n","3293:  They can also support water use regulation through voluntary changes to water use within existing water rights.\n","3295:  The Water Use Plan process could be broadly applied to other licence holders in BC because it has shown _great promise in dealing with conflicts among owners

allocation decisions; _ Assessments are conducted on a watershed basis to identify the available surface water resources, instream flow requirements for fish, existing and potential licensable water demands, and to provide direction regarding future water licence allocations; _ Significant resources may be invested in gathering required water flow information, undertaking assessments, and working with agencies and stakeholders to develop the plan; _ The WAP is submitted to the regional water manager for approval; _ The WAP becomes regional policy upon signature by the regional water manager;

of plans may be developed to assist with the protection of water quality in British Columbia.\n","3385:  Drinking Water Protection Plans are established under the provincial Drinking Water Protection Act by the government to prevent a substantial threat to water supplies that would result in a health hazard.\n","3388:  Well Protection Plans can be expanded to the protection of entire aquifers, or perhaps multiple aquifers.\n","3394:  Protecting source water and drinking water quality is primarily about ensuring that point and non-point sources of pollution do not adversely impact water for human consumption.\n","3396:  For an overview of roles and responsibilities for the protection of drinking water quality see the Ministry of Health website for Drinking Water Quality.\n","3397:

Source Protection and Upstream Activities In many cases, resource-related activities on private and Crown lands, such as forestry, ranching, agriculture and mining, can effect nearby or downstream community water supplies.\n","3445:  Increased frequency and severity of drought and flood events, low summer flows, warmer freshwater temperatures, reduced dilution / assimilative capacity, and increased erosion, turbidity and sedimentation are just a few examples.\n","3446:  These and other climate-related impacts should be addressed in plans that consider medium to long- term pressures on water quality.\n","3448:  See sections 3 and 9 of this guide for information, tools and resources about climate change impacts on water, related community vulnerabilities and risks, as well as considerations about how climate impacts can be managed through water and watershed planning as well as adaptation.\n","3459:  In BC, Well Protection Plans may be required under the following circumstances: _ By health authorities when they review an operating permit for a large drinking water system that includes wells; _ By the provincial government as a condition of granting infrastructure funding for new municipal/regional district wells; and, _ As a condition of a provincial environmental assessment for proposed large withdrawals.3 Well protection plans are developed for an area that includes the recharge area for a well or aquifer.\n","3462:  A more holistic approach may aim to address multiple aquifers within a region or community and it may also aim to address both quality and quantity issues.\n","3464:  29 Key Elements and Steps In partnership with the BC Ground Water Association, the Province of BC published the Well Protection Toolkit, which was updated

following planning processes encourage more integrated and holistic approaches and can help to address a variety of water supply, demand, and quality issues, and include: _ Water Management Plans (Water Act, Part 4) _ Watershed Management Plans _ Stormwater (Rainwater) Management Plans 32 Why Undertake Integrated Planning for Water, Land and Watersheds BC communities are undertaking integrated watershed planning and are adopting a wide range of strategies to manage a multitude of current and future challenges, pressures and changes in watersheds.\n","3548:  Many of these pressures may be effectively addressed within plans that recognize the interconnections within a watershed system, including: _ surface water and groundwater connections; _ water quantity and quality connections; _ land and water connections; and _ community and watershed connections.\n","3554:  Growing Demands on Limited Water Supplies A variety of land and water uses can impact water supply and demand, stream hydrology, groundwater tables, surface and groundwater quality, and the overall health of watersheds.\n","3557:  Changes in Land Use and Land Cover In many communities across BC, changes in land cover due to activities such as forestry, and increased imperviousness as a result of urban development can result in more _flashy_ stream and river hydrology and increased rates of erosion and sediment transport.\n","3567:  These and other climate-related impacts should be addressed in plans that aim to consider medium to long-term pressures on water quantity, quality, and ecosystem health.\n","3569:  See sections 3 and 9 of this guide for information, tools and resources about climate change impacts on water, related community vulnerabilities and risks, as well as 33 considerations about how climate impacts can be managed through adaptation and water and watershed planning.\n","3572:  Because this will occur when stream flows are at their lowest and when fish are particularly vulnerable, this may lead to increased levels of conflict among water users.\n","3574:  It should be noted that although this guide focuses on planning and climate change adaptation for water and watersheds, climate change impacts will undoubtedly have a variety of other impacts on terrestrial ecosystems such as forests, grasslands and alpine ecosystems.\n","3595:  Water Management Plans should be considered where regulatory tools are required and will provide an opportunity to achieve the planning objectives.\n","3597:  However, significant resources may be required to develop and implement this type of plan.\n","3598:  Therefore, this approach to planning may not be feasible for some communities.\n","3600:  Because there is potential for the two types of plans to overlap, the Drinking Water Protection Act and Water Act state that if both types are to be initiated within one particular area, they can be developed jointly.\n","3601:  Key Elements and Steps The following are some of the key elements and steps in preparing a Water Management Plan: _ The plans are requested by letter to the regional water manager or to the comptroller of water rights; _ The plans require an assessment of preparedness among stakeholders, first nations and the province; _ The plans are initiated & have their terms of reference established by an order of the minister; _ The plans are required to consider existing provincial or local government strategic, operational, and land use or water use planning processes; _ Preparation of the plans must include an extensive public consultation process; _ Consideration must be given to the results or progress of provincial or local government strategic, operational and land use or water use planning processes within the designated area; _ The plans require approval by an order from the provincial cabinet to acquire official status; _ The plans are brought into effect by the creation of a regulation that is designed to implement the plan, approved by the provincial government by the lieutenant governor with advice from cabinet; and, _ The plans are implemented through regulation (the plan implementation regulation) issued by the lieutenant governor in council.\n","3622:  Ideally, watershed plans and the organizations involved in implementing the plans should emerge from the planning process with: _ improved understanding of the watershed and how it functions; _ clear objectives of how to manage the watershed sustainably and in an integrated manner; _ clearly specified community and environmental outcomes; _ decisions that are based on the best available information; _ adequately resourced management and implementation; and _ good integration with other regional and resource-based plans.5 It

facilitation The process is coordinated and managed effectively.\n","3772:  This may not be necessary in all cases, particularly where the planning issues may be less conflicted, where the community is not polarized, or where the lead facilitator of the planning process has established trust and credibility within the community.\n","3783:  To foster these relationships, it is important to develop a shared vision that celebrates differences as well as areas of common ground.\n","3789:  Having a champion behind a planning initiative can really help motivate a group, and keep it focused on the end goal.\n","3791:  Planning can take time, patience and persistence, and a committed and passionate champion can help build and maintain the necessary momentum.\n","3793:  A widely respected and credible leader can also inspire broader participation and collaboration within a planning process.\n","3797:  If there is no apparent single leader within a process, it can be helpful to bring in people from around the region and/or country who have relevant experience and expertise on key issues.\n","3802:  Introducing water centric thinking can be particularly challenging when facing common issues such as jurisdictional conflicts or a lack of expertise.\n","3804:  In some cases, local leadership can be supplemented and/or strengthened with collaborative approaches at the regional scale.\n","3807:  AnCOuVeR islAnd 8.3.1 COnVeninG fOR ACtiOn On V Convening for Action on Vancouver Island (CAVI) is an exciting initiative that has emerged in response to the need to plan for

prepare for climate change and population growth in the watershed.\n","3857:  While an increase in both financial and human resources is desirable, it may not be realistic in many communities.\n","3862:  Capacity may be limited in smaller BC communities, where there may be only one or two municipal staff to cover planning responsibilities, and where funds may be too limited to cover the costs of hiring consultants.\n","3872:  8.4.2 stRenGthen finAnCiAl ResOuRCes Resourcing can significantly influence the success of planning, and is commonly cited as a limiting factor in planning processes.\n","3881:  While funds may be available for climate adaptation planning, it is more difficult for local governments to secure funds to implement adaptation measures.\n","3883:  For example, making proactive choices to upgrade municipal utilities may make sense on one level, but when there may be no immediate, tangible benefits, it can be difficult to persuade taxpayers and elected officials to commit to large investments.\n","3884:  Develop a Financial Strategy Planning processes invariably take longer than expected.\n","3893:  A successful financial strategy will take both challenges and opportunities into consideration.\n","3894:  The following are recommendations, gathered from various communities across the province, for successfully obtaining project funding: _ Be strategic; look at the bigger picture.\n","3895:  Design your project so that it can advance multiple objectives, such as climate change mitigation and/or adaptation and environmental enhancement.\n","3899:  This may open up new opportunities by diversifying funding sources.\n","3900:  _ Align with common objectives.\n","3906:  _ Be realistic about project timelines and

appropriate to a community would be beneficial, as would an assessment of public and political support for those mechanisms.\n","3928:  _ Volume-based Water Use Fees can be applied either to individuals or water suppliers to target heavy-use water consumers and to provide incentives for water conservation.\n","3929:  The fee structure needs to be equitable to avoid creating economic hardship for low-income residents and the agricultural community.\n","3930:  _ Municipal Drainage Utilities can be formed as an alternate source of raising funding.\n","3931:  This approach can help ensure dedicated funding for drainage and stormwater planning, infrastructure and operations.\n","3934:  If local government becomes actively involved in licence administration at any level, some of these funds could be used to fund water conservation and management projects at the local level.16 _ Recreational User Fees applied to powerboat or off-road vehicle rentals are a means of targeting polluting activities of tourists or seasonal residents who do not otherwise contribute funds to water management in a region.16 _ Reserve Funds can be established by implementing changes in service delivery systems (e.g., contracting out a regional service), which can sometimes translate into savings for a local government.\n","3941:  Although subtle nuances differentiate data from information

to communicate climate information to decision-makers.\n","4321:  This transfer of knowledge between climate scientists and users must not only include the climate information itself, but also a

Identifying and obtaining the relevant information can be a challenge in and of itself but is one of many steps required to develop an adaptation framework (Figure 1).\n","4431:  DEFINING ADAPTATION AND DECISION-MAKER The term adaptation is used in this guide to refer to all processes, actions and strategies that allow individuals, communities, and organizations to cope with, manage, and adjust to changing climatic conditions such that risks are minimized and opportunities are seized10.\n","4433:  In exploring adaptation outcomes, which includes initiating activities that reduce vulnerabilities or exploit opportunities.\n","4443:  Consequently, recognizing what and how to use climate information may not always be straightforward.\n","4446:  Finally, climate information must

highlight the fact that climate information can be tailored to suit the needs of a variety of users.\n","4456:  The former provides information on historical events while the latter can simulate both past and future periods.\n","4458:  TARGET AUDIENCE This guide is intended to be broad-reaching and written in a general fashion in order to help decision- makers from all sectors of activity faced with the task of evaluating the impacts of climate change and/or of implementing adaptation measures.\n","4460:  The information presented will be particularly useful for users who have limited experience with climate information and climate services.\n","4461:  A better understanding of the available climate information will increase their ability to evaluate their particular needs and to either prepare the information themselves or to communicate their requirements to climate service providers.\n","4462:  Climate service providers will also benefit from the guide since it will help them better categorize demands in terms of the use or purpose of the climate information and acquire a better sense of the different types of climate formats that can be tailored according to user expertise.\n","4466:  HOW TO USE THIS GUIDE This guidebook is meant to appeal to a wide range of users and therefore contains information with varying levels of complexity.\n","4467:  Consequently, many will not need to read the entire document.\n","4472:  It may therefore be helpful to evaluate one_s needs in Chapter 2 and then use that information to focus on the associated climate information category in Chapter 3.\n","4474:  While the weather varies on a daily basis, climate captures variations on all time scales, from one decade or century to the next, and even on a seasonal and yearly basis (Figure 2).\n","4479:  Many such climatic phenomena that are part of real world natural variability emerge from climate model simulations but they often exhibit different statistical properties.\n","4487:  Given the natural variability in the climate, it will still be possible with climate change, to experience short terms trends that are opposite to the overall projected trend due to climate change.\n","4492:  Note that climate normals should not be confused with reference period.\n","4497:  The particularities of the study undertaken by the decision-maker can influence the baseline period chosen.\n","4500:  GUIDEBOOK ON CLIMATE SCENARIOS | 8 1.3 CLIMATE MODELS Climate models are numerical tools based on mathematical equations that aim to represent processes of the climate system.\n","4509:  As the nature of the climatic system is non-linear (chaotic), obtaining an exact analytical solution of the mathematical equations over the entire globe would require so many simplifications that the solution would be too different from the real system to be very useful.\n","4515:  on a grid) in space and time of the basic equations of fluid mechanics solved using a

Moreover, increased resolution (through the use of downscaling techniques for example) will not necessarily yield more useful information to the decision-maker.\n","4554:  Table 1 and Figure 5 can be used to compare both sets of emissions scenarios.\n","4556:  Name Radiative forcing equivalent CO2 (ppm) Temp anomaly (_C) Pathway SRES temp anomaly equivalent SRES A1FI* RCP8.5 8.5 W/m2 in 2100 >1370

The definition of the _past period_ for which observed GHG emissions are available and used to drive climate models is updated with each new IPCC assessment.\n","4571:  To obtain a climate simulation, many different inputs are required in a climate model, such as a detailed portrait of the Earth_s surface including geophysical data (soil types, types of vegetation, continental contours, location and bathymetry of large bodies of water, description of the topography, etc.).\n","4574:  It is important to understand that none of these future climates should be considered a prediction: all the future climates projected by different climate models with different GHG forcing scenarios should be considered equally plausible.\n","4575:  The time span of a simulation can range from a few years to thousands of years, both for the past and future periods (Figure 7).\n","4576:  The length of time over which climate models are run to produce simulations differs from one climate center to another but can range for example from 1850 or 1900 to 2100 or even 2300 (see example of Figure 7).\n","4582:  ), which should all be physically consistent with one another from one point on the grid

models with different emissions scenarios.\n","4602:  A model can also be run multiple times with the same RCP with slight perturbations in the initial conditions, for example by changing the start date of the simulation to obtain what are called ensemble members.\n","4604:  GUIDEBOOK ON CLIMATE SCENARIOS | 16 1.6.1 COUPLED MODEL INTERCOMPARAISON PROJECT (CMIP) As discussed above, there are numerous climate modeling centers around the world, each developing their own climate model and there are currently four plausible emissions scenarios to consider when producing climate simulations.\n","4607:  Consequently, it would be impractical, if not impossible, for each climate modeling center to run all available models with all available RCPs.\n","4622:  These conclusions should reassure users that climate information provided using CMIP3 models remains valid and robust even if there is now a gradual shift towards use of CMIP5 model results.\n","4629:  Indeed, impacts studies conducted with an older ensemble should not be automatically disregarded when new simulations are made available.\n","4636:  important since this variability can be in opposition, at least for a few decades, to the longer-term trends that are associated with anthropogenic climate change (Figure 3).\n","4637:  It may take several decades before the climate _signal_ emerges from the _noise_ of year-to-year variability.\n","4651:  The planning horizon will also greatly impact the type of climate information that would be most appropriate.\n","4655:  The importance of relying on an iterative process of revisiting climate projections and re-evaluating adaptation measures put into place, as recommended by an adaptation framework, may be particularly beneficial here (Figure 1).\n","4686:  Moreover, some input from users and climate service providers can help the selection process in some cases37.\n","4695:  They may therefore not be representative of other indices over different temporal timescales (monthly snow cover for example).\n","4697:  21 | GUIDEBOOK ON CLIMATE SCENARIOS 1.9 DOWNSCALING TECHNIQUES GCMs simulate the evolution of the climate system over the entire planet, with a horizontal resolution of around one hundred to three hundred kilometres (left panel on Figure 11), for periods that can reach thousands of years.\n","4709:  It can involve various techniques (multiple regressions, stochastic generators, neural networks), which are used to establish statistical relationships between observed local conditions and predictors obtained using data from the recent climate (e.g.\n","4710:  The statistical downscaling of a GCM simulation relies on the hypothesis that the statistical relationships established for the recent past will remain the same for the future.\n","4719:  Arguably, many adaptation strategies will be developed for a relatively small area (local scale), which may therefore require finer resolution climate information.\n","4720:  However, the mean change projected from a GCM over a 200 km grid cell may not be very different from what is projected once the data are downscaled to a smaller grid cell (from either dynamical or statistical downscaling), particularly given the uncertainties around the model ensemble projections.\n","4723:  Surface characteristics like topography, coastlines or the vicinity of a body of water do not have the same effect on the various climate variables and this influence could also vary from one season to another.\n","4733:  GUIDEBOOK ON CLIMATE SCENARIOS | 24 1.9.2 DYNAMICAL OR STATISTICAL DOWNSCALING The choice of downscaling method to use is not a simple one.\n","4763:  Note that the main assumption made with post- processing is that biases are (almost) identical for the reference period and the future period, which may not be the case.\n","4764:  In addition, as mentioned previously post-processing can be used independently from, or in combination with downscaling techniques, which often results in some confusion between the two concepts.\n","4765:  An important warning regarding post-processing technique must be raised.\n","4773:  The latter allows for a different correction factor to be applied to the distribution tails, a given simulation.\n","4776:  to specific time horizons (such as 30-year periods), not to the entire time-series.\n","4777:  This method can be done using two approaches, namely by calculating a mean change over the entire distribution A B Figure 13 | Example of delta/scaling post-processing technique.\n","4792:  1.11.1 REFERENCE PERIOD AND FUTURE HORIZONS Climate change scenarios compare the average climate between a past period, referred to as the reference period or horizon, and a future horizon.\n","4795:  Note however that an important distinction must be made here with climate normals, which are calculated from observations and the data over the reference period, which comes from climate simulations.\n","4802:  Climate projections should NEVER be compared directly with observations.\n","4803:  The reason climate model outputs or simulations cannot be compared directly with observations is that climate model results (i.e.\n","4825:  Categories and user type Climate information categories do not reflect a type of decision-maker but rather reflect the reason why the information is required, and the specifics of the climate data itself.\n","4827:  GUIDEBOOK ON CLIMATE SCENARIOS | 34 It is important to note that all criteria presented in Figure 16 can be equally

One of the five priority vision statements identifies Iqaluit as _a community that adapts to climate change._ The plan sets out two high-level objectives to realize this vision: (1) to study the impacts of climate change on the community and (2) to adopt policies that recognize the long-term impacts of climate change.\n","6329:  D R O F K L E F O T C I R T S I D F O Y S E T R U O C O T O H P

setbacks.\n","6382:  The lots in a proposed subdivision may be clustered in the least hazardous part of the property.\n","6385:  Generally, subdivision plans must demonstrate good access and efficient utility service for all the proposed lots and also address concerns about financial, environmental and other impacts.\n","6396:  Y S E T R U O C O T O H P O T N O R O T F O Y T F O I C E H T 10 | L A

Canada and the capital of Nova Scotia.\n","6407:  Covenants may serve local planning goals in different ways: _ as a development control tool _ Municipalities may use covenants when entering development agreements, applying controls on subdivisions and other development projects or imposing conditions on issuing a development permit.\n","6409:  Covenants may be used in _green developments_ that use innovative energy, waste water treatment and other systems that require public access and the collaboration of future owners for proper operation and maintenance.33 _ as a conservation tool _ A special form of covenant, known as a conservation covenant or easement has been established by law in many provinces.\n","6410:  It places restrictions on the use of land to protect its natural values.\n","6411:  For example, a conservation covenant may prohibit the removal of native vegetation and prohibit any structures on a portion of the property that contains sensitive ecosystems.\n","6413:  Covenants and easements can play an important role in climate change adaptation planning.\n","6415:  A covenant may be negotiated with owners in an area to prevent construction of docks, sea walls or other coastal protection structures in order to allow marshes and dunes to migrate inland naturally.35 Covenants and easements may also support local efforts to monitor climate change by, for example, allowing access to a coastal property for purposes of measuring erosion rates.\n","6416:  S E L A Z N O G .\n","6417:  E F O Y S E T R U O C O T O H P Island

practices in the design of certain aspects of a development project (for example, buildings, public areas, infrastructure, mechanical systems, landscaping).\n","6431:  Municipalities may develop design guidelines for several reasons: to improve environmental performance, reduce infrastructure costs, enhance aesthetics, increase public safety or create more accessible public spaces.\n","6437:  The design of a community_s physical components _ such as parking lots, parks and roadways, drainage ditches or a neighbourhood as a whole _ can reduce or magnify the impacts of climate change at the local scale.41,42 Good design can contribute to building resilience to climate change at the local level.43 For example, selecting appropriate building materials and landscaping can reduce the risk of wildfires.\n","6440:  For example, a municipality may prescribe building wide roads to accommodate emergency vehicles.\n","6452:  Y S E T R U O C D L E F U E N T E H C O T O H P F O 14 | L A N D U S E

urban design and environmental performance of surface parking lots within city boundaries.\n","6455:  All proposals for new parking lots within city limits, both public and private, must consider the guidelines before receiving development approval.\n","6457:  Although not designed explicitly as a climate change adaptation measure, the application of the guidelines, particularly the urban heat island and storm-water management measures, increase the city_s resilience to climate change.\n","6458:  O T N O R O T F O Y T I C E H T F O Y S E T R U O C O T O H P L A N D U S E P L A N N I N G T O

impacts of the proposed development and establish appropriate actions to address those impacts.\n","6484:  Many of the tools described here help planners to translate scientific findings about climate change into a language and format that is suitable for making decisions about adaptation.\n","6500:  Risk management processes can be used by a community to evaluate risks associated with climate change and suggest adaptation measures.\n","6502:  The evaluation process may be formal or informal and may be quantitative or qualitative, depending on what works best for the municipality.\n","6504:  i The IPCC56 described several distinct conceptual frameworks for assessments of local climate change, including impact-based approaches that are climate scenario driven, adaptation-based approaches that focus on the capacity of communities and natural systems to respond effectively to stress, vulnerability-based approaches centered on the factors driving the susceptibility of individuals and groups to harm, integrated approaches that include modelling and other procedures for investigating climate change across sectors and scales and risk management approaches that focus directly on decision making.\n","6505:  L A N D U S E P L A N N I N G T O O L S | 19 Heat and health vulnerability assessment in Windsor, Ontario Windsor (population 210 891) is Canada_s most southerly city and

emerging vulnerabilities (for example, potential conflict over access to water) and support efforts to prioritize climate change risks.\n","6568:  To help the community prepare for future climate changes, a scenario planning project was conducted in 2009, led by a local college in collaboration with the territorial government, local and First Nations governments, private sector firms and community groups.76,77 In a series of meetings, members of the community identified local vulnerabilities under four possible _future histories_ of Whitehorse.\n","6570:  For instance, Scenario 4,

step is to visit your municipal government_s website or contact the public works, utilities or building department to !nd out about their programs on reducing basement \"ooding.\n","7258:  _ Are there engineering studies on your subdivision?\n","7264:  Talk to your insurance agent or broker.\n","7265:  Talk to your insurance agent or broker to !nd out about what types of water damages are covered under your policy.\n","7267:  Get a plumber to conduct a plumbing investigation of your home Each home is unique.\n","7269:  Understanding the risks of basement \"ooding and the nature of your plumbing and sewer connections will help to ensure that the best course of action is taken to reduce future water damage in your home.\n","7270:  Your municipality may help you !nd a plumber.\n","7272:  Taking action on your own Seal cracks in foundation walls and basement !oors Sealing cracks is a simple way to help reduce basement \"ooding in your home.\n","7274:  Most of the time, you should not have to dig anywhere beside the foundation to repair them.\n","7279:  COARSE GRAVEL WEEPING TILE When connected to the municipal sanitary sewer system, eavestrough downspouts can contribute a substantial amount of water to these systems.\n","7280:  Because of the environmental impacts resulting from combined sewer over!ows and the increase in basement \"ooding risk that connected eavestroughs cause, it is illegal to connect downspouts to municipal sewer systems in many Canadian communities.\n","7283:  Questions for a plumber In many cases, it is the more substantive measures that are the most effective way to reduce basement \"ooding.\n","7286:  Talk to your municipal government to make sure you or the person you have hired have the proper permits.\n","7290:  You should: _ Check your lot to see if your yard slopes away from your home.\n","7291:  Look everywhere, including under stairs and decks.\n","7293:  Typical backyard swale with a drain.\n","7295:  _ Talk to the department in your municipal government that is responsible for building inspections and stormwater drainage about swales (the grassy depressions that help direct water away from homes) and lot grading.\n","7296:  Ask them where swales should be on your property, and where water from your lot should be directed.\n","7299:  Older Canadian homes, for example those built before the 1940s or 1950s, may not have foundation drains.\n","7300:  If you !nd that your home does not have a foundation drain and you experience serious in!ltration \"ooding, you should consider having a foundation drain installed.\n","7302:  A plumber will need to decide if it can be !xed or it needs to be replaced.\n","7306:  Disconnecting your weeping tile from the sanitary or storm sewer can help reduce the chances that you and your neighbours will experience basement \"ooding.\n","7307:  It can also reduce the risk of structural damage to your home.\n","7310:  B When weeping tiles are disconnected from sewer laterals, a sump-pit and sump-pump must be installed.\n","7316:  You can inspect the sump-pump by pouring water into the sump pit, and seeing whether or not the pump starts automatically.\n","7317:  Gasoline powered generator Sump-pumps need electricity.\n","7319:  You should use a back-up system to make sure the pump works when you need it.\n","7320:  Talk to your plumber or electrician about options.\n","7326:  Make sure you install the type of valve recommended by your municipality.\n","7327:  Installation of the backwater valve may reduce the cost of insurance or be required as a condition of insurability.\n","7331:  When installing backwater valves: The valve should be installed based on the manufacturer_s installation instructions, which have speci!cations for placement and grading.\n","7335:  If placed in the wrong location relative to other plumbing !xtures on the sanitary lateral, the valve could be bypassed and provide no protection.\n","7336:  If the valve is placed in the wrong location, sewer backup pressure can build up and crack the basement \"oor and lead to \"ooding.\n","7337:  If the weeping tiles are still connected to the sanitary sewer lateral downstream of the valve, sewage could be forced back into the weeping tiles and lead to structural damage to the foundation, this can also lead to in!ltration \"ooding.\n","7339:  An improperly maintained valve may fail during a \"ood.\n","7341:  The valve should be checked regularly to ensure that it will function properly when it is needed.\n","7344:  during intense rainfall events.\n","7346:  If you_re not sure if the valve is closed, check it _ you should be able to see it through the clear, plastic top.\n","7348:  D Sewer laterals, the pipes that connect a home_s plumbing system to the municipal underground sewer system, should be regularly maintained.\n","7350:  This may especially be a problem in older homes when the lateral has not been routinely maintained.\n","7352:  To !nd out how well your sanitary sewer lateral has been maintained, you should talk to a licensed plumber who can carry out a camera inspection of your

YOURSELF FLOODING IS THE MOST COMMON AND COSTLY DISASTER IN THE UNITED STATES AND CAN HAPPEN ANYWHERE.\n","7386:  As you begin to think about which might be the best for you and your home, consider following these three key steps: 1.\n","7387:  Know Your Risk.\n","7388:  Anywhere it can rain, it can food_so we all live in a food zone, and we all live with the risk of food damage to our property.\n","7389:  Learn more details about your home_s level of food risk, including the type of food zone it is in and, if available, the potential food elevation (referred to as the _base food elevation_ on a food map).\n","7391:  You can also visit the offcials in your community who maintain the FEMA food maps and elevation certifcates; they may work in the local planning and zoning offce or in the building department.\n","7392:  Talk to them, your neighbors, and others about any past food events and how high the water has risen in the past at or near your home.\n","7393:  Insure Your Property.\n","7394:  As a homeowner, it_s important to insure your home and personal belongings.\n","7395:  Even if your home is in a low- or moderate-risk food zone, purchasing a food insurance policy is highly recommended.\n","7400:  Reduce Your Risk.\n","7401:  Decide how to prepare your family and protect your home from fooding.\n","7404:  Please be aware that food mitigation measures need to be tailored to the property in question.\n","7408:  Lastly, please remember to be kind to your neighbors!\n","7409:  Consulting adjacent property owners is very important when any actions on your property, such as extending downspouts or regrading areas between homes, could affect their property.\n","7410:  _ Install a rain barrel.\n","7413:  You can use this stored water for non-potable uses such as watering the lawn and gardens or washing your car.\n","7414:  _ Elevate utilities and service equipment.\n","7415:  Raise and anchor air conditioning condensers, heat pumps, water meters and other service equipment onto pedestals or platforms that are at least 1 foot above the potential food elevation.\n","7417:  This inexpensive action can help prevent signifcant damage and disruption following a food event.\n","7418:  _ Anchor outdoor fuel tanks.\n","7419:  Attach outdoor fuel tanks to a large concrete slab that weighs enough to resist the force of foodwaters, or install inexpensive ground anchors that are connected across the top of the tank with metal straps.\n","7420:  Unanchored fuel tanks can be easily moved and ruptured by foodwaters and pose serious threats to people, property, and the environment.\n","7421:  If located in an identifed high- risk zone, fuel tanks should also be elevated to or above the regulatory food elevation as adopted by the local community.\n","7422:  If not feasible then all flling and ventilation tubes should be elevated so that foodwaters cannot enter the tank.\n","7423:  OUTSIDE THE HOME For the exterior areas of your property, consider taking the following actions: _ Maintain proper water runoff and drainage.\n","7424:  Routinely clean and maintain gutters, downspouts, and splashpads so that rainwater from your roof fows easily away from your home.\n","7425:  Also, make sure that any nearby drainage ditches or storm drains are clear of debris and functioning properly.\n","7426:  _ Improve lot grading.\n","7427:  Determine how water fows or accumulates around your home to identify potential trouble spots (often easy to see during an average rainstorm).\n","7428:  Stormwater should always drain away from the building; if necessary, change your landscaping to improve runoff.\n","7429:  This may include building up any sunken areas around the foundation, digging small depressions to properly channel water, and otherwise improving the yard so that it slopes away from your home.\n","7430:  _ Reduce impervious surfaces around your home.\n","7432:  Retaining and creating natural green space around your home can help reduce sewer overfows by reducing stormwater runoff.\n","7433:  Consider options such as rain gardens, vegetated swales, or pervious pavements, which allow more water to be absorbed by the ground.\n","7434:  INSIDE THE HOME For interior areas below the potential food elevation, consider making the following alterations: _ Protect your valuable possessions.\n","7435:  Move important documents and other valuable or sentimental items to a safer location, well above the potential food elevation and/or inside watertight containers.\n","7436:  _ Seal your foundation and basement walls.\n","7437:  Close any foundation cracks with mortar and masonry caulk or hydraulic cement, which expands and flls gaps completely.\n","7438:  Seal walls in your basements with waterproofng compounds to avoid seepage.\n","7439:  Make sure any foor drains are clear of obstructions.\n","7440:  _ Install food vents.\n","7443:  Flood openings may be required for lower enclosures of homes being built in high-risk food zones, but they can also be installed in existing homes.\n","7444:  Once installed, make sure your food vents are kept free of debris and will allow the free-fow of foodwater.\n","7445:  _ Install a sump pump.\n","7448:  Be sure to choose a device with battery-operated backup, in case of electrical power failure.\n","7449:  _ Prevent sewer backups.\n","7455:  FLOOD PREPAREDNESS You may be able to take additional actions immediately before an expected food event that will prevent or reduce food damage to your home: _ Activate food protection devices (turn on sump pumps, close backfow valves, etc.).\n","7456:  _ Shut off electricity at the breaker panel.\n","7457:  _ Safeguard important paperwork and move furniture, rugs, electronics, and other valuable belongings to upper foors, or at least off the foor of the ground level.\n","7458:  _ Elevate major appliances onto concrete blocks.\n","7460:  _ Deploy temporary food barriers, such as portable food gates or shields, sandbags, infatable foodwalls, and food skirts.\n","7461:  _ Replace wooden foorboards and carpets with ceramic tile, vinyl, rubber, or other food-resistant materials.\n","7462:  Use moveable rugs instead of ftted carpets.\n","7463:  _ Replace internal walls and ceilings with food-resistant material such as lime plaster, cement board, concrete, or pressure-treated and decay-resistant wood.\n","7464:  _ Replace wooden doors and window frames with metal or other food- resistant options.\n","7465:  _ Raise electrical system components.\n","7466:  Increase the height of electric service panels (fuse and circuit breaker boxes) and all outlets, switches, and wiring to at least 1 foot above the potential food elevation.\n","7467:  These modifcations should be made by a licensed electrician.\n","7468:  _ Protect utilities and service equipment.\n","7469:  Move the main parts of your heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems to a higher foor or the attic.\n","7470:  Consider raising other major appliances, such as washers, dryers, and hot water heaters, above the ground foor.\n","7471:  If relocation or elevation is not possible, you can protect service equipment in place using low foodwalls and shields.\n","7472:  Alternative options such as replacing traditional hot water heaters with tankless units should also be considered.\n","7473:  _ Anchor indoor fuel tanks.\n","7474:  Anchor fuel tanks by attaching them to a large concrete slab that weighs enough to resist the force of foodwaters.\n","7475:  _ Install a food alert system.\n","7476:  A variety of food sensors and other early warning devices can alert you to the risk of imminent fooding so that you can take preventative or protective actions before extensive damage occurs (see _Flood Preparedness_).\n","7478:  Contact your local community offcials.\n","7479:  Start with the local planning and zoning offce or building department, and ask to speak with the designated foodplain administrator.\n","7480:  Consult local contractors or design professionals with food mitigation expertise.\n","7481:

Protect is a reactive strategy to protect people, property and infrastructure from sea level rise and is typically the first response considered.\n","8180:  It may also compound risk by encouraging further development behind dikes and other structural protection elements, thereby increasing the number of people and amount of property at risk if these fail.\n","8182:  Communities may use a protect strategy as an interim measure, providing time to implement a retreat or avoid strategy; however the strategy should be recognized as a temporary solution and not used to encourage further development.\n","8183:  Other forms of protection can take place.\n","8185:  These measures can be implemented as sea levels rise, and may complement or supplement structural protection.\n","8186:  Such non-structural adaptations can enhance the natural resilience of the coastal zone and can be less expensive than structural protection, which can lead to unwanted effects on erosion and sedimentation patterns if not properly implemented.61 Accommodate is an adaptive strategy that allows continued occupation of coastal areas while changes are made to human activities and/or infrastructure to adapt to sea level rise.\n","8187:  Accommodation can also involve retrofitting a building or making it more resilient to the consequences of sea level rise.\n","8189:  Strategies

systems.\n","8349:  This may identify infrastructure at risk and enable adaptations.\n","8378:  Economic obligations associated with development in hazardous areas may increase (e.g., development in areas at risk of coastal hazards with no protection measures).\n","8380:  Incorporating adaptation to sea level rise into these objectives and policies is a logical next step.\n","8388:  Advantages Disadvantages Research and policy development in adapting to sea level rise may be time consuming and require a commitment of staff and financial resources.\n","8389:  The addition of policies to address sea level rise may add controversy, particularly _Avoid_ or _ Retreat_ strategies.\n","8392:  The degree to which objectives are met and policies implemented can be measured and monitored over time.\n","8396:  Projected future sea levels can then be superimposed on a topographic map of coastal hazards to identify new areas subject to hazards.\n","8405:  The set of elevation points generated by a LiDAR survey can be brought into a geographical information system (GIS) and used to build surfaces that represent the earth_s topography with great precision.\n","8406:  This provides an ideal base map which can be used to determine coastal hazard risk.73 Ground surveys provide the highest accuracy; however, to cover an entire coastline using this method may be impractical and prohibitively expensive.\n","8407:  Ground surveys may be used to supplement or monitor the accuracy of the results received from LiDAR or other technologies.\n","8409:  Floodplain map topography should not be relied upon to establish specific building elevations.74 An engineering analysis is then used to map areas at risk.\n","8416:  This lack of sea ice must also be documented as a coastal hazard.\n","8421:  Coastal hazard mapping complements and strengthens other adaptation options and increases stakeholder awareness of areas at risk.\n","8447:  Environmental _ Coastal hazard mapping may incorporate environmental data such as coastal habitats at risk or sensitive ecosystems and enable better environmental protection for areas at risk.\n","8454:  In order for coastal hazard maps to effectively reduce future coastal hazard risk and facilitate sustainable development, the consideration of hazard maps must be integrated into planning procedures and periodically updated.\n","8455:  The required expertise and modelling capacity may not be locally available, especially in smaller local governments.\n","8457:  To pool limited resources and address trans-boundary impacts, work at a regional scale _ with support from various levels of government _ is often the most effective approach to hazard mapping.\n","8469:  Risk Management In itself, new coastal hazard mapping will not cause a reduction in risk nor address sea level rise.\n","8470:  The information must be integrated into other regulatory, land use change, and structural and non-structural tools before the full benefits can be realised.\n","8471:  To realise the full benefits of coastal hazard mapping, it is important to provide people in the areas at risk with information about emergency procedures and ways of reducing risk.\n","8473:  The collection of topographic and bathymetric data to complement extreme water level and wave height information could be expensive.\n","8480:  The second involves selecting and implementing management measures.\n","8482:  Coastal hazards due to sea level rise may include the risk of a major disaster such as a dike failure as well as risks from gradual changes such as increasing salinization of groundwater.\n","8483:  A risk assessment may have aspects that affect people, the environment and the economy.\n","8489:  With sea level rise, increased protection measures will be required just to maintain the same level of protection (i.e., 1:100 years or 1:200 years) that has been historically provided.\n","8491:  Should a higher level of protection be called for, additional measures will be required.\n","8492:  Whether the standard of protection remains the same or is increased, other approaches to risk management may be required.\n","8494:  Enabling Legislation A risk assessment does not require specific enabling legislation.\n","8496:  Risk management may also be undertaken as part of an emergency planning and preparedness initiative.\n","8499:  It can also include an analysis of the cost of _doing nothing._ A cost- benefit analysis _ used to determine how well, or how poorly, a planned action will turn out _ can assist the risk management process.\n","8503:  (Can it be justified?\n","8506:  This involves comparing the total expected cost of each option against the total expected benefits, to see if the benefits outweigh the costs, and by how much.\n","8508:  Environmental _ Risk management may be used to reduce sea level rise risks to environmental assets and species at risk.\n","8517:  Risk management may involve a rigorous, defensible analytic approach with reliable information used to support decision making.\n","8521:  The absence of detailed studies may impede some initiatives but should not prevent the use of interim measures to reduce risk (e.g.\n","8522:  minimum setback and elevation from the natural boundary or other potential risk).\n","8525:  Coastal flooding may result in property damage, damage to or destruction of property contents, economic losses due to severed transportation links and other damaged infrastructure.\n","8529:  Application Emergency planning and preparedness measures may be undertaken in all coastal areas at risk of coastal hazards, irrespective of the other adaptation tools implemented.\n","8539:  In 1999, to assist local and diking authorities to prepare a flood

floods.\n","8549:  Their municipal emergency management guide outlines key components and steps to help communities to develop plans, create exercises and ensure resources have been identified before an emergency occurs.\n","8551:  Emergency planning templates are available for municipalities and local businesses to create an emergency plan specific to the community or business requirements and emergency training is offered to individuals and organizations that have a role to play in an emergency.\n","8553:  Input in the form of assistance _ technical and monetary _ for the preparation of emergency plans or planning may come from higher government departments, agencies, and NGOs.81 Environmental _ This tool is not intended to address environmental issues.\n","8554:  Social _ The primary objective of this tool is the protection of human life, followed by the maintenance of essential services and the protection of infrastructure and buildings.\n","8555:  This tool lays the groundwork to prepare for a possible emergency and undertake planning measures including the evacuation of an area to protect human life.\n","8560:  The plans must be updated regularly to remain current.\n","8568:  Regulation of Land Use Tool Description Land use can be regulated through neighbourhood plans, character guidelines, capital works plans, strategic plans, growth management plans and setback regulations.\n","8569:  Land use can also be regulated through the establishment of appropriate zoning within areas subject to or potentially subject to coastal hazards.\n","8570:  Zoning can regulate a wide range of activities, including restrictions on land uses, land use densities, setbacks, siting circumstances and servicing standards.\n","8571:  Application Land use regulation _ especially zoning _ is a tool available in all provinces, although the specific scope of regulation ranges from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.\n","8573:  This tool can also be used to create new composite zones, such as a Sea Level Rise Planning Areas.\n","8574:  Enabling Legislation In B.C., under Section 903 of the Local Government Act, a local government may by bylaw divide the whole or part of the municipality or regional district into zones, name each zone, establish their boundaries and regulate the use of land, siting and density of buildings and other structures within each one.\n","8575:  This legislation could be used to create new zones with respect to coastal areas and enable a local government to regulate the use of land.\n","8576:  In B.C., provincial guidelines82 call for new construction containing habitable space to be located above the historical 1 in 200 year flood event plus an additional safety margin (called freeboard) to deal with uncertainty.\n","8603:  (Province of Nova Scotia 2009) (Province of Nova Scotia 2009) 84 85 42 Regulatory Tools In Newfoundland and Labrador, responsibility for land use planning is shared by the provincial, federal, municipal, Innu Nation and Nunatsiavut governments.\n","8608:  All individuals applying for unencumbered Crown land in Newfoundland and Labrador must maintain a 15 metre buffer zone between the shoreline and the boundary of the issued title though there is a reduction to 10 metres for residential lots and some older land grants are exempt.\n","8609:  As in other provincial jurisdictions, municipalities and regional planning authorities can implement measures under their own plans and bylaws to protect coastal areas from sea level rise, flooding, erosion or other hazards.\n","8612:  While these restrictions have significant economic implications, they may be introduced in the public interest, for example, to meet changing community needs and manage competing interests and conflict.\n","8613:  Environmental _ Regulation may facilitate identification and protection of environmentally sensitive areas and manage environmental hazards.\n","8619:  Public acceptance may also pose a challenge.\n","8625:  87 See draft Humber Valley Regional Land Use Plan 2011-12.\n","8629:  Local government may not be able to impose zoning that will render the land sterile (i.e., unable to be used) but it can restrict the way in which land and buildings are used so that risks can be addressed.\n","8630:  Technical supporting documentation to address coastal flood risks may be expensive (e.g., floodplain mapping, design briefs, updated flood risk assessment, implementation measures to adapt to or reduce flood risk).\n","8631:  Interim measures may lack technical documentation but can be undertaken at modest cost (e.g.\n","8632:  sea level rise study area).\n","8633:  Subdivision Regulation Tool Description Subdivision regulation can be used to prevent or establish conditions for the subdivision of land at risk from coastal hazards associated with sea level rise.\n","8634:  A proposed subdivision must go through a review process, which culminates in the approval (including approval with conditions) or refusal of the proposed subdivision by the Approving Officer or other appointed official.\n","8636:  This can include a simple property, bare land strata lot, or strata unit (e.g., townhouse, row house, or condominium unit in an apartment building).\n","8645:  A subdivision can also be refused if the cost to government of providing public utilities or other works and services would be excessive or if the subdivision would adversely affect the natural environment.\n","8656:  all have similar environmental provisions in place.\n","8661:  Subdivision regulation can be used to address environmental issues such as suitability of land use and development impact.\n","8662:  Social _ Various public stakeholders and potential land owners may be affected by the approval or refusal to approve a subdivision.\n","8663:  An Official Community Plan or a similar guiding document may provide a framework for these decisions and provide guidance on the suitability of subdivision development; particularly for residential use.\n","8664:  Implementation Measures and Challenges This tool relies heavily on accurate information and coastal hazard mapping to provide grounds for the approval or refusal of a subdivision.\n","8672:  The loss of potential development value could result in resistance from developers.\n","8673:  Reducing subdivision of coastal land should not be undertaken ad hoc or without supporting guiding policy or a strategy in place.\n","8678:  Development Permit Tool Description A Development Permit is a form of land use regulation distinctive to B.C.\n","8680:  A Development Permit can regulate development for a variety of purposes, two of which are applicable to sea level rise: _ protection of the natural environment, its ecosystems and biological diversity; and _ protection of development from hazardous conditions.\n","8685:  The objectives of the Development Permit must be established and guidance given for addressing the objectives.\n","8689:  Enabling Legislation In B.C., a local government can establish Development Permit Areas under Section 919.1 of the Local Government Act.\n","8690:  A DPA and guidelines can be included in an Official Community Plan or a zoning bylaw.\n","8691:  Where a DPA has been designated by bylaw, no subdivision, building construction or alteration, or alteration of land can proceed unless a Development Permit has first been issued by the local government.\n","8692:  In order to address the hazardous conditions specified in the DPA, the local government may require that the applicant provide a report certified by a professional engineer.\n","8694:  If an OCP designates areas as requiring a Development Permit, this must be issued prior to the subdivision of land within the area and the construction of, addition to or alteration of a building or other structure.\n","8696:  The cost of the independent professional and the cost of meeting the Development Permit conditions can also be considerable.\n","8700:  Social _ The establishment of a Development Permit Area in an OCP or zoning bylaw requires a public hearing.\n","8705:  Advantages Disadvantages Hazardous areas must be documented and identified prior to their designation.\n","8710:  A Development Permit cannot be turned down by the local government if the specified objectives and guidelines are met.\n","8713:  A DPA can be included in an Official Community Plan with a narrative describing the objectives that justify the designation and specifying the guidelines for addressing the objectives, accompanied by a map.\n","8720:  Building Regulation Tool Description Local communities have a tools which can be used to influence the manner in which buildings are situated and constructed.\n","8726:  The National Building Code does not have specific design requirements to protect buildings from coastal hazards but does ensure that buildings are constructed to certain safety and design standards.\n","8727:  47 Regulatory Tools Although not all local governments in British Columbia have chosen to enforce the provincial code, technically, the code applies throughout the province.\n","8735:  Under section 56 of this Act, a municipal building inspector may withhold the issuance of a building permit until satisfied the land can be safely used and can require a geotechnical report by a qualified professional if construction is proposed on land likely to be subject to hazards such as flooding or erosion.\n","8736:  A building permit can be refused until the owner agrees to a covenant on the property title stating that the land will only be used in the manner certified in the report.\n","8754:  In some cases a project may have to be abandoned if a qualified professional cannot certify that a building can be safely constructed for the intended use or that the cost for doing so would be excessive.\n","8757:  Other planning tools that typically occur at an earlier stage in the development process should be used to address environmental criteria (e.g., growth management policies, easement, land purchase, subdivision, and zoning).\n","8758:  Social _ This tool is designed to address public safety.\n","8760:  If a building cannot safely be constructed in a particular location or if the cost of doing so is economically prohibitive then it will not be constructed, thus reducing the risk to people and property.\n","8761:  The use of this tool gives priority to the protection of the public.\n","8762:  Implementation Measures and Challenges In B.C.\n","8763:  the Community Charter and Local Government Act authorizes the local government building inspectors to withhold the issuance of a Building Permit unless a qualified professional can provide a report certifying the land can be used safely for the intended purpose.\n","8766:  In some smaller communities, local government has chosen not to undertake a building inspection function and so in these areas, this tool cannot be used.\n","8774:  Local governments may not have the technical resources to give guidance in determining the minimum elevation for safe building construction (i.e., Flood Construction Level).\n","8776:  Reliance on a qualified professional introduces the risk of retaining a person who lacks the necessary skills.\n","8778:  Where building regulation or enforcement has not been adopted as a local government function, this tool will not be available.\n","8780:  Land Acquisition Tool Description Local governments can gain ownership of land for the primary purpose of addressing public safety through purchase or expropriation.\n","8781:  Land can be acquired for a variety of purposes, including structural protection works (i.e., a dike or other hard protection), vehicular access or setbacks for public safety.\n","8782:  Land can also be acquired to prevent the development or to hold it in public ownership for exclusive public use.\n","8783:  Application Land can be acquired to accommodate a new dike, for the landward expansion of an existing dike or as the land base needed for other forms of structural protection.\n","8784:  Land acquisition can be used to provide public open space, protect rare or endangered habitat or create an ecological reserve.\n","8785:  It can also be used to avoid the cost of servicing land at risk due to sea level rise.\n","8786:  Land purchase may take place to prevent the development of land subject to hazards, however if land is required for a public purpose, government cannot simply downzone land for exclusive public use without compensating the owner.\n","8788:  Expropriation may also be referred to as a compulsory acquisition, compulsory purchase or eminent domain.\n","8794:  Land acquisition may also be used to provide for public open space purposes subject to restrictions on improvements and the timing and extent of activities.\n","8795:  Social _ There are social considerations and impacts associated with the acquisition of private land to protect the public interest.\n","8797:  dike or seawall).\n","8798:  Social benefits may include the acquisition of public open space and public access along a dike.\n","8802:  Strategic or Official Community Plans may identify properties needed for future land acquisition and, if so, make provisions for funding these acquisitions.\n","8808:  Land purchase may be used in combination with other tools to reduce the cost of flood protection (e.g., dike vs. seawall).\n","8809:  This will require a comparative analysis of options that includes the cost of land and structural tools.\n","8822:  The tool can direct development away from the area at risk by designating the _donor_ or _sending_ area and allocating it to an appropriate _receiving_ area where development or increased density can be safely accommodated.\n","8825:  Density transfer could apply to any land use but is typically applied to residential uses.\n","8827:  An Official Community Plan or other similar policy document is needed to determine both areas at risk and areas where additional density is deemed suitable.\n","8829:  Density transfer relies on an administrative process to regulate exchanges and a market to determine value.\n","8830:  Density transfer could be applied in any municipality and would be best used in conjunction with a strategic plan where managed retreat is an objective.\n","8831:  Enabling Legislation The transfer of development potential can occur within the normal powers of zoning.\n","8838:  Social _ The primary use of this tool would be to reduce the development or redevelopment potential of land in areas at risk due to sea level rise.\n","8844:  This tool is market-based and could be structured so local government requirements are limited to administrative costs.\n","8845:  Transfer of density potential could be combined with land acquisition in which the local government acquires ownership of the land and transfers the development potential to the former owner elsewhere in the same municipality.\n","8846:  Density transfer may provide a less costly alternative to land acquisition (whether voluntary or through expropriation).\n","8850:  As a voluntary undertaking, the transfer of development potential may not prevent the development of areas at risk from coastal hazards.\n","8853:  It can be used to allow access over, use of or other limitation that benefits one piece of land (known as the dominant tenement) and burdens another (known as the servient tenement) without resulting in a change of ownership.\n","8860:  Restrictive or negative requirements would include a limitation on development for flood protection purposes or prevention of the use of fill.\n","8886:  Under this Act, a private landowner may impose a restrictive covenant on his or her land by entering into an agreement with a covenant holder.\n","8887:  Such a restrictive covenant may be positive or negative in nature and prohibit specific uses of the land.\n","8893:  A Save Harmless provision in a covenant can be used to protect a local government from financial damages in the event of future flooding.\n","8894:  The cost of an easement or statutory right-of-way will vary depending on the applicable conditions _ an appraisal is frequently used to determine fair market value.\n","8896:  A local government may be able to issue a tax receipt for a conservation easement if it is classified as a charitable gift by the Canada Revenue Agency.\n","8898:  Part or all of the land may be restricted for habitat conservation and a covenant may also be used as means of requiring an undertaking for environment enhancement purposes.\n","8903:  Challenges may include securing an agreement with the land owner as to the nature, value and funding of the restriction.\n","8904:  Advantages Disadvantages Annual compensation or a lump sum payment may be required to secure the easement or statutory right of way process or servitude.\n","8905:  The easement or other restriction can be limited to a particular part of a site, a particular purpose or a specific time period.\n","8908:  A covenant may be used in conjunction with other tools such as subdivision, building or land use regulation.\n","8909:  A conservation easement may be considered a charitable gift by the Canada Revenue Agency.\n","8910:  A covenant may be negotiated as part of the development approval process with no direct cost to the local government.\n","8911:  Land Trusts Tool Description A land trust is a non-profit private organization created for the purpose of environmental conservation or other similar purpose.\n","8917:  Land trusts may work in a variety of ways to address their individual mandates; these can include accepting gifts of land from private donors, undertaking fundraising to acquire land to prevent the loss of environmentally significant values, and managing land in public ownership to protect and enhance its habitat and other environmental characteristics.\n","8919:  While this does not specifically refer to adaptation to sea level rise, the conservation objectives of existing land trusts can easily accommodate this aspect, particularly with habitat creation or enhancements such as coastal wetland and sand dune creation, or rehabilitation.\n","8920:  Englishman River Estuary on Vancouver Island, B.C.\n","8924:  Local government could facilitate involvement of a land trust without necessarily expending financial resources and achieve the objective of protecting people from coastal hazards.\n","8926:  Social _ This tool can either restrict or enhance public access to environmentally sensitive land or habitat rehabilitation areas.\n","8928:  Implementation Measures and Challenges The implementation of this tool can include acquiring land by a land trust through fundraising, eco-gift, or government transfer, preparing a conservation agreement, and undertaking the necessary restoration and maintenance of the land once an easement, covenant or other restriction is in place.\n","8936:  Fundraising for privately managed land acquisition by a land trust offers opportunities that may not be available if government is involved.\n","8937:  Local governments can work collaboratively with land trusts to identify areas that may be suited to environmental protection and play a facilitation role but leave the negotiation with the land owner up to the trust.\n","8938:  Foreshore Tenure Tool Description A foreshore tenure is a legal instrument that authorizes a use or uses over intertidal and subtidal areas.\n","8939:  This may include a lease or licence of occupation.\n","8941:  A foreshore tenure by itself will not provide protection from coastal hazards.\n","8942:  However, it may, in conjunction with zoning, provide the mechanism to enable a more comprehensive approach to shoreline management.\n","8943:  Application A foreshore tenure could be applied to almost all of Canada_s southern coasts.\n","8945:  Foreshore tenure does not affect the underlying Crown ownership of land (including land under water) but it can be used by a local government as part of a comprehensive approach to shoreline management such as beach nourishment, sand dune or coastal wetland creation and/or rehabilitation as well as hard structural protection.\n","8950:  A licence of occupation may be used if the term is short, where minimal improvements are proposed or for remote sites where survey costs may be prohibitive.\n","8951:  A statutory right of way may also be used to accommodate a linear corridor within a foreshore area.\n","8953:  The interests of riparian owners and First Nations must usually be considered and the lease must be consistent with zoning by local government or other applicable authorities.\n","8972:  Enabling Legislation In B.C.\n","8983:  58 Land Use Change or Restriction Tools West Vancouver, B.C.\n","8984:  Seawall Evaluation and Governance Considerations Economic _ In B.C., the cost of a foreshore lease is set by the Province.\n","8985:  The assessed or market value of a lease may be set at a percentage of the land value, for example 8% annually.\n","8989:  This can facilitate implementation of innovative soft armoring approaches such as habitat enhancement of intertidal areas, beach nourishment or the creation of wetlands.\n","8991:  Social _ Local governance tenure over the foreshore can allow for partnerships with riparian owners and local community groups to provide protection for upland areas or intertidal habitats.\n","8993:  Increased recreational use may provide an additional indirect benefit.\n","8995:  One challenge will be to refocus this tool as part of a sea level rise adaptation strategy.\n","9000:  59 Land Use Change or Restriction Tools Advantages Disadvantages Foreshore tenure could enable a local government to undertake a broader range of shoreline management and adaptation measures in response to coastal hazards.\n","9001:  A foreshore lease (or other form of tenure) could enable environmental enhancement to occur with less reliance on structural protection.\n","9005:  The applicability of this tool will be limited to areas with suitable shoreline conditions and bathymetry.\n","9016:  The surface may include a gravel topping or filter fabric as well as topsoil for landscaping.\n","9017:  Other scour protection may take the form of pile foundations designed to derive vertical and lateral support below the depth of scour.\n","9019:  A scour apron may be used to support retaining walls of linear infrastructure (e.g.\n","9020:  dikes) to ensure the toe of the structure is protected.\n","9023:  Environmental impacts will be limited for buildings, but may increase in magnitude where scour protection is introduced along a linear corridor such a seawall, stormwater outfall or a pipeline crossing.\n","9025:  Social _ This tool is intended to minimize risk to the foundations of buildings and structures.\n","9030:  The tool may be implemented in conjunction with other requirements as determined by a building inspector, approving officer or the terms set within a covenant on title.\n","9034:  Advantages Disadvantages Provide a barrier to protect the foundation of a building or other structure from wave action or other form of rapidly moving water.\n","9044:  The increase in elevation above the natural ground level can be determined through a risk assessment by a qualified professional or in accordance with local government requirements, guidelines or policy.\n","9046:  In urban areas where lot areas are smaller, this tool may involve creating non-habitable space (crawl space or cellar) in areas subject to flooding.\n","9047:  A combination of fill and building design changes may be used for new development on a neighbourhood level or for infill redevelopment within an existing area.\n","9049:  If a local government considers that flooding may occur on a piece of land, the local government may adopt a bylaw requiring a minimum elevation for the underside of a floor system of a house on that land.\n","9050:  Such a bylaw must consider the provincial guidelines, which take sea level rise and related impacts into account.\n","9059:  Flood construction requirements in Atlantic Canada may reference a minimum elevation above sea level datum, geodetic datum or protection for a 1 in 100 year return period or a 50 year design standard.\n","9064:  The affected site area will include the building footprint area plus a sloped area for the fill, typically at a 3:1 slope, to return to the natural ground level.\n","9065:  Alternatively, a retaining wall or other structure could be used to reduce or eliminate the sloped area.\n","9066:  The amount of fill could be substantial.\n","9071:  Electrical outlets would have to be raised and a furnace located above the Flood Construction Level.\n","9074:  The cost of floodproofing can also be compared to the cost of development in an area without risk of coastal flooding or inundation.\n","9077:  The cost of floodproofing can also be compared to the cost of development in an area without risk of coastal flooding or inundation.\n","9079:  63 Structural Tools (Flood Protection Works) Social _ This tool primarily minimises risk to building inhabitants and structures themselves.\n","9084:  Structural elevation measures can be implemented after a building is constructed but incur greater costs.\n","9086:  A large structural elevation rise on a small property may not be feasible.\n","9088:  Providing access for persons with disabilities poses an additional challenge.\n","9093:  Although architectural design can address visual impact to some extent, a major change in elevation for a dwelling or other habitable structure serves as a vivid and constant public reminder that flooding is a risk that must be addressed.\n","9095:  The cost associated with raising the elevation of a building can be considerable.\n","9101:  The placement of fill to raise the ground level may not be aesthetically attractive if the elevation change is large.\n","9103:  Dikes Tool Description A dike is commonly a linear compacted earthfill structure intended to protect a designated area from inundation caused by high water conditions on an adjacent watercourse or floodplain.94 Dikes typically form the key defense element in a protect strategy.\n","9105:  Sea dikes typically have a flatter gradient on the seaward side, for the purpose of dissipating wave energy.\n","9107:  In addition, a sea dike will typically have toe scour protection consisting of riprap and an under layer of filter rock or geotextile to prevent it from being undermined.\n","9117:  Assets protected by dikes can include infrastructure and agricultural lands.\n","9134:  once in 10 years).\n","9135:  This would potentially flood over 20% of Sackville during a storm surge.\n","9137:  Where an increased dike height is involved, the economic, social and environmental implications of a seaward versus a landward expansion must be examined.\n","9139:  The standard for flood protection measures (i.e., Flood Construction Level for current sea level vs. projections for 2050 or 2100) will have a critical impact on the economic costs.\n","9141:  The capital and operating costs of dikes may limit their implementation to selected locations, such as densely populated areas, areas with high natural or cultural importance, and high value infrastructure.\n","9143:  Intermittent funding programs may not be appropriate where the need for upgrades is ongoing and long-term.\n","9144:  It may be difficult to obtain public acceptance depending on the capital costs and the distribution of those costs, especially if property views are impacted.\n","9146:  (Liekse and Bornemann 2012) 98 66 Structural Tools (Flood Protection Works) Sea dike upgrade costing study, Metro Vancouver, British Columbia99 In 2011 the Province of British Columbia published a Climate Change Adaptation Guidelines for Sea Dikes and Coastal Flood Hazard Land Use (Ausenco Sandwell, 2011), which defined sea level rise planning levels and

and low-lying areas that may require protection as sea level rises were considered.\n","9163:  Implementation Measures and Challenges Apart from the high costs for construction, dike implementation measures require land acquisition for the linear corridor occupied by the dike as well as access for maintenance and emergency measures.\n","9164:  The linear corridor may affect numerous landowners and may require the relocation or removal of other structures.\n","9167:  Dikes can provide protection for high value development and maintain or enhance property values.\n","9170:  The dike crest may be available for use as a recreation corridor.\n","9172:  They may restrict access to the shore and reduce the recreational value of a shoreline.\n","9173:  Dikes may cause erosion to adjacent

called bulkheads.\n","9188:  Sea dike and upgraded Oliver Pump Station, Corporation of Delta, B.C.\n","9190:  They can be concrete, timber, armour rock (riprap), gabions and other materials.\n","9211:  Groynes, breakwaters and storm surge barriers may cause negative environmental impacts and transfer risk onto nearby properties.\n","9225:  Hard structural protection can provide protection for high value development or natural areas and maintain or increase property values.\n","9226:  A seawall may be available for use as a recreation corridor.\n","9228:  Structural measures to protect against erosion in one place can increase erosion elsewhere.\n","9229:  This situation may occur where incoming waves approach the shoreline at an angle causing sediment to move along the shoreline until blocked by a groyne.\n","9232:  Seawalls and other hard protection structures are expensive to construct and maintain, can be unsightly and restrict shore access.\n","9237:  It may be used for existing developments with small land parcels built where infrastructure is slightly below the established Flood Construction Level.\n","9243:  Adequately sized openings must be provided to equalize hydrostatic pressure.\n","9244:  Owners must be willing to experience a temporary loss of use of areas subject to flooding and must ensure damageable goods are not located in areas subject to flooding.\n","9246:  Social _ Wet flood proofing may reduce the risk of flooding to people and buildings.\n","9251:  Advantages Disadvantages Can reduce the time and cost of cleanup after a flood.\n","9252:  Wet floodproofing can be less costly than other retrofits as no additional land is required and the appearance of the building is minimally affected.\n","9253:  Allowing water to enter and exit a building may be a cost-effective alternative to dry floodproofing.\n","9254:  A wide range of water resistant materials can be used at a reasonable cost.\n","9258:  Goods may be damaged by floodwaters if they cannot be moved to higher ground.\n","9265:  Application On the seaward side, this tool can be used as part of a protect or accommodate strategy.\n","9269:  Wetland creation may be facilitated through Environment Canada_s Ecological Gifts Program.\n","9274:  Environment Canada_s Ecological Gifts Program, through which a landowner donates ecological sensitive land and receives a tax benefit, may be of assistance, although this program does not apply to existing intertidal areas, which are owned by the Crown throughout Canada.\n","9277:  Social _ Passive recreational activities, such as bird watching and interpretive opportunities, may complement the creation of coastal wetlands.\n","9280:  Implementation Measures and Challenges Like any tool, the appropriateness of wetland or salt marsh restoration must be evaluated on a site-by-site basis.\n","9281:  Understanding the biophysical conditions under which restoration is being considered is particularly important as these may ultimately determine the long-term sustainability of a restored wetland or marsh.104 Implementation measures include land acquisition, foreshore lease, covenant or other form of protection.\n","9282:  An assessment of the area by a Registered Professional Biologist or other qualified professional should take place.\n","9290:  Wetlands can provide highly productive new habitat and environmental benefits.\n","9293:  Dune Building or Rehabilitation Tool Description Naturally occurring dunes are wind-formed sand deposits representing a store of sediment in the zone just landward of normal high tides.\n","9299:  Both natural and artificial dunes can be stabilized through vegetation planting; vegetation roots help stabilize the dune.\n","9307:  Vegetative planting or fences may be used to stabilize an artificial dune.\n","9314:  Loss of views and direct access to coastal areas may affect existing residents.\n","9316:  Implementation could serve as a community education process about non-structural measures used in adapting to sea level rise.\n","9317:  Creating dunes on the ocean side may not be feasible.\n","9324:  Adopted in 2005, dated in 2010.\n","9326:  Dune protection can meet multiple objectives, including environmental enhancement and protection, public and recreational access, and hazard reduction.\n","9327:  Dunes can be created in a sensitive manner by taking into account the environment in which they are placed.\n","9328:  Dunes and the vegetation of dunes can provide an important environmental benefit by creating or increasing valuable coastal habitat for species at risk.\n","9329:  Dunes, especially artificial dunes, can be perceived as a barrier to beach access, and a dune creation proposal may run into community opposition.\n","9330:  While providing protection from erosion, dunes may conflict with residential or tourism purposes where the concern is maintaining _sea views_.\n","9331:  Dune development may be seen as an opportunity to encourage additional coastal development at risk from sea level rise.\n","9335:  As well, the bathymetry near the shoreline may not be suitable for the use of this tool.\n","9336:  Dunes may require a large footprint, which may have significant cost implications.\n","9337:  Beach Nourishment Tool Description Beach nourishment refers to the addition of sand or other similar beach sediment material to satisfy the erosional forces of natural wave action and prevent shoreline erosion.\n","9340:  The cross-sectional shape of a beach affects its ability to dissipate wave energy: a wide and shallow beach will attenuate wave energy more effectively than a steep and narrow beach.\n","9343:  Beach nourishment will likely be required on an ongoing basis as long as the forces of erosion are present.108 Application Beach nourishment can use sediment material dredged from the ocean, or material barged, trucked, moved by heavy equipment or by a conveyor belt from a land-based source.\n","9345:  If the available beach material drops below to a critical level, re-nourishment will be required to avoid further erosion and damage to coastal infrastructure.\n","9350:  The allocation of costs between individual benefiting property owners and the community as a whole may need to be addressed.\n","9351:  Beach nourishment may offer economic benefits as an alternative to or in combination with other forms of structural protection.\n","9352:  Environmental _ Beach nourishment may enhance intertidal areas.\n","9353:  However, negative effects could occur if the material deposited does not match the size and composition of native beach material, if the deposited material provides excessive turbidity or if the depth of material deposited buries existing marine organisms.\n","9357:  Ongoing monitoring will be required to evaluate the success of the beach nourishment and when additional beach nourishment is required.\n","9360:  This tool may provide an alternative to the use of hard protection such as groynes which can disrupt natural processes of sediment supply to a beach.\n","9361:  Beach nourishment can enhance the value of beaches by providing a more aesthetically appealing environment.\n","9363:  Beach nourishment may address multiple objectives, including environmental enhancement and protection, public and recreational access, and hazard reduction.\n","9365:  Beach nourishment can become prohibitively expensive if a supply of sediment is not readily available.\n","9368:  It will require regular monitoring and periodic re-nourishment depending on the rate of erosion that takes place.\n","9369:  Beach nourishment may affect the productivity of intertidal areas.\n","9377:  after a major storm surge in December, 2004.\n","9384:  A protect strategy may be suitable for an historic area where all buildings and infrastructure would be frequently inundated without the installation of linear structural protection such as a dike.\n","9385:  An accommodate strategy may apply to a new development at the margins of an area at risk of coastal flooding.\n","9386:  An avoid strategy may be applied to prevent a proposed new residential development or a large commercial or institutional development in a previously undeveloped area at risk of flooding.\n","9406:  now employ living shorelines approaches.\n","9417:  While this approach can discourage asset investment within high-risk hazard areas, it also puts pressure on local, provincial and federal government to provide _protection_ against the hazard.\n","9421:  Mutuality _ a large number of people must combine to form a risk pool or community.\n","9423:  Ability to be assessed _ the peril must be measurable and quantified in terms of possible losses of economic value.\n","9424:  Randomness _ the risk must be independent of the will of the insured and the event must not be predictable, except in a general way.\n","9431:  Property owners most exposed to a flood risk will be motivated to purchase flood insurance.\n","9432:  Demand for flood insurance 111 112 113 114 (National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy 2011) (Sandink, et al.\n","9433:  2010) (National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy 2011) (Hallegatte 2006) 85 will be low outside of risk areas.\n","9440:  Demand for flood insurance is concentrated in areas with a high risk of flooding; few people would voluntarily purchase insurance specifically to protect against flooding if they did not live in a flood risk area.\n","9442:  Adverse selection results in insurance rates that are prohibitively high for homeowners.\n","9446:  Bundling insurance to include flood or erosion coverage can make it unavoidable, or effectively compulsory.\n","9456:  United States of America The National Flood Insurance Program is administered through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in cooperation with private insurance agencies.\n","9459:  In its early years, even subsidized rates did not provide a sufficient incentive for homeowners to purchase flood insurance or for communities to join the National Flood Insurance Program.\n","9460:  Subsequent legislative changes in 1974 and 1994 required federally insured or regulated lenders to require flood insurance as a condition of granting or continuing a loan for a building located in the Special Flood Hazard Area of a participating community.\n","9465:  This program offers flood insurance to homeowners, renters, and business owners.\n","9499:  Where the flood probability is greater than 1 in 75 years and improved flood defenses are provided, flood insurance for households and small businesses will be maintained.\n","9513:  Planning Policy Statement 25 concerned national policy on development and flood risk in England.\n","9518:  2010) (Department for Communities and Local Government, UK Government 2010) (Sandink, et al.\n","9519:  2010) (Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) 2010) 88 Of particular interest is a policy calling on local planning authorities to _reduce risk from coastal change by avoiding inappropriate development in vulnerable areas or adding to the impacts of physical changes on the coast._ Local planning authorities are called on to identify as a Coastal Change Management Area any area likely to be affected by physical changes on the coast and make clear what development will be appropriate in such areas and in what circumstances, as well as to make provision for the relocation of development and infrastructure where this is needed.\n","9527:  If an area is subject to flood hazard, the property owner will suffer inconvenience in the event of a flood but little economic risk.\n","9533:  Flood insurance can address all of these concerns to some degree, because it will transfer some of the risk away from senior governments and onto private property owners through insurance premiums.\n","9542:  Would better align risk management objectives.\n","9543:  Homeowners who choose to purchase in areas at risk would pay for the additional risk and those in low risk areas would benefit from risk avoidance.\n","9545:  Flood insurance premiums will spread risk with other geographical areas also subject to flood risk.\n","9546:  Owners of residential dwellings would be able to obtain insurance for the actual value of improvements (current Disaster Financial Assistance limit in B.C.\n","9548:  Flood insurance could be linked with other forms of insurance commonly used in Canada (e.g.\n","9556:  Emergency activities can be structured in four components: (1) preparedness; (2) response; (3) recovery; and (4) mitigation122 or adaptation.\n","9557:  The first is discussed under the Emergency Planning and Preparedness tool while the following two are discussed in this section.\n","9580:  If the local government requires emergency powers within the Emergency Program Act, including the evacuation of residents, a state of local emergency should be declared.\n","9585:  _ Compensation and Disaster Financial Assistance Regulation, 1995 This regulation describes compensation and disaster financial assistance, eligibility for assistance and what is covered.\n","9586:  Disaster financial assistance may be claimed for eligible personal expenses (i.e., the principal residence of the owner of a structure damaged or destroyed in a disaster and _the necessities of life_ of a tenant, small business expenses, farm operation expenses, charitable or volunteer expenses and local government body expenses).\n","9588:  Financial assistance to repair or rebuild a structure may be denied if assistance has been provided on two previous occasions.\n","9589:  _ Local Authority Emergency Management Regulation, 1995 This regulation outlines the required contents of Local Emergency Plans and defines the powers and duties of a local authority under the Act.\n","9609:  The report evaluated two adaptation strategies for coastal areas: climate related development planning and strategic retreat.\n","9611:  No additional growth would be permitted, but existing dwellings could be rebuilt following a storm surge.\n","9615:  Funding Projects Related to Sea Level Rise in Canada There is currently no national program for funding shoreline protection or for combating the impacts of sea level rise along the 243,000 kilometres of coastline in Canada.\n","9637:  The municipality would have to contribute $2 million of the total budget, and would be responsible for all maintenance costs over time.\n","9643:  Nova Scotia municipalities must now prepare Municipal Climate Change Action Plans (CCAP) to access the Gas Tax

distinction between deciding not to act, and not acting because of inertia or failing to consider alternatives.9 A strategic, or planned approach to climate change adaptation has a number of key benefits for local governments: _ Greater opportunities for adopting measures that have co-benefits and align with other community goals can be explored; _ _ _ _ Time can be taken to evaluate and address potential insurance and liability issues arising from climate change impacts; Cost savings can be realized by considering climate change impacts in the regular maintenance/updating/renewal schedule of existing infrastructure and by planning for new infrastructure to avoid expensive upgrades later; Adaptation measures that have unintended adverse impacts are more likely to be avoided if they have been identified and evaluated in advance; Emergency needs can be identified and prioritized in advance of crises; _ Opportunities for cooperation with other governments and agencies can be explored; _ _ _ Communities can be consulted and engaged in developing and implementing responses; Steps can be taken to enhance the resilience of vulnerable ecosystems before environmental thresholds

the information about local risks and vulnerabilities to land use planning is in some ways very similar to conventional planning for natural hazards by local governments: land use needs to be determined so that the risks faced by different geographic areas within the community are accept- able in terms of the type of development and permitted uses in that area.\n","13907:  As well, risks and vulnerabilities should be periodically reassessed to incorporate evolving and updated information about climate change impacts.\n","13908:  3 The risks related to natural hazards associated with

Sea Level Rise Sea Level Rise is predicted to be moderate in the period from 2010 to 2025.\n","48:  However, the rate is predicted to increase more quickly in the period leading up to 2100, and then continue to increase steadily.\n","49:  For the purpose of this document the current definition of the expected Sea Level Rise is provided in Figure 3-1.\n","50:  The basis for this definition is provided in the policy document: Policy Discussion Paper 20101.\n","51:  Figure 3-1: Projections of Global Sea Level Rise Figure 3-1 illustrates the range of uncertainty in projections, showing a median projection, as well as a range in projections from low to high.\n","52:  The uncertainty increases into the future.\n","53:  To protect the large investment that buildings involve, and respecting current trends in SLR, a precautionary principle is followed to create the Recommended Curve for Sea Level Rise Policy in BC.\n","54:  As new SLR predictions become available with more accuracy, allowances for SLR in coastal BC areas may be adjusted, up or down, reflected in a change to these guidelines in the future.\n","55:  The combination of certain sea level change - but at an uncertain rate into the future - creates complexity for the determination of Designated Flood Level (DFL) and related Flood Construction Level (FCL).\n","56:  Rev: 0 Date: 27 January 2011 Project No:

continues.\n","57:  The pace of sea level rise and the arrival of more accurate projections will inform how often a revision to FCLs needs to take place.\n","58:  Given current information, a review in five years, and then again by 2025, as well as at least once every 25 years thereafter, is warranted.\n","59:  Building Life Cycle and Sea Level Rise 3.2 In considering FCL in the face of an evolving sea level, it is necessary to consider the longevity of the buildings, structures or land use under consideration.\n","60:  A range of 50 to 100 years of practical service life is expected for most buildings, although some building life may extend well beyond that lifespan.\n","61:  Given the prospect of rising sea level, it is necessary to establish a FCL that anticipates a flood level applicable to the end of the lifespan of the proposed building.\n","62:  Figure 3-2 illustrates how planning for the 100 year lifespan of a structure or land use brings future SLR increases into immediate focus.\n","63:  The graphic illustrates, in 100 year steps, how building elevations may need to be incrementally adjusted higher to accommodate gradual SLR.\n","64:  Figure 3-2: Incremental Sea Level Rise Effect on Planning for 100 Year Life Structures For land use management guidance in BC, allowances for Sea Level Rise until the Year 2100 should be used in current planning and building approvals.\n","65:  This guideline should apply for the period from 2010 until the next SLR review, which should be completed by 2015.\n","66:  Figure 3-2 shows how high SLR projections could affect a building that has an expected lifespan extending to the Year 2100.\n","67:  An allowance of 1.0 m of SLR plus or minus regional effects (e.g.\n","68:  crustal uplift or subsidence) could be required.\n","69:  Figure 3-2 also extends the allowance out to the Year 2200, indicating that an additional SLR of approximately 1.0 m, for a total allowance of approximately 2.0 m, can be expected over the 200 year period.\n","70:  SLR over the next centuries will continue to increase the pressure for ever higher building elevations to adapt to the risk of flooding from the sea.\n","71:  Rev: 0

Construction Level In coastal areas, calculation of the Flood Construction Reference Plane (FCRP) and a Flood Construction Level (FCL) that reflects expected SLR is complex, and will vary depending on the local tide conditions, shoreline orientation and exposure and other factors that change allowances for local storm surge and wave effects.\n","72:  An example of the calculation of the FCL for an exposed location at Victoria, where a recent surveyed elevation of a present Natural Boundary is available, is provided in Table 3-1, based on the existing guidelines; Land Use Guidelines 20043, and for these updated guidelines, for application up to the years 2100 and 2200.\n","73:  _Guideline_ provides recommended values for current planning for the BC Coast for the indicated years as indicated in Figure 3-1.\n","74:  _Possible_ represents the highest potential values as defined in the companion _Policy Discussion Paper 2010_1 and indicated by the upper envelope curve in Figure 3-1.\n","75:  The _Possible_ scenario is only included to illustrate the potential implication of the present upper bound of all global scenarios.\n","76:  The updated estimate for 2010 in Table 3-1 shows that the change from relying on the elevation of the present Natural Boundary to one which is based on expected water levels makes no significant difference to the estimation of a FCL for 2010.\n","78:  Table 3-2 provides preliminary FCRPs and FCLs for various areas of the BC coast for the year 2100, based on the Recommended Sea Level Rise Curve in Figure 3-1 and annual exceedence probabilities (AEP) defined in the companion document Policy Discussion Paper 20101.\n","79:  It should be noted that these preliminary values should vary due to a number of factors that are site specific, including: the local rate of crustal uplift or subsidence, the nature of the tides, anticipated local storm surge effects that depend on local bathymetry and the particulars of the anticipated storms associated with the storm surge.\n","80:  The preliminary values provided in Table 3-2 are provided for guidance.\n","81:  Further analysis is required to provide FCRPs and FCLs for specific sites.\n","82:  SLR Planning Areas should be established along the BC Coast to provide a basis for local calculations and guidance on required Flood Construction Levels, and to provide a basis for management of the expected ongoing increases in SLR as it affects land use and buildings.\n","83:  Proposed terms of reference for SLR Planning Areas are introduced in Section 4 Rev: 0 Date: 27 January 2011 Project No:

provide balance between economic development objectives and the precautionary principle, an Adaptive Risk Management approach to Sea Level Rise is warranted.\n","92:  Land use and building approvals based on FCL for 2100 should also include provisions for adaptive management of land uses to Sea Level Rise to the Year 2200 and beyond.\n","93:  The long term view should also apply when approval of a lot parcel or a building implies a change (increase) in the intensity of land use that extends beyond the life of building.\n","94:  An Adaptive Risk Management Approach to SLR would plan how short term land uses and structures can be occupied with reasonable risk for their lifespan, but at the same time recognize and allow that future SLR may require the redesign to a higher elevation or relocation of the next generation of land uses and structures at a given coastal site.\n","95:  Rev: 0 Date: 27 January 2011 Project No: 143111: BC Ministry of Environment/ Climate Change Adaption Guidelines for Sea Dikes and Coastal Flood Hazard Land Use 9 The FCL and Setback for a given site may vary at the point that a building has ended its planned lifespan.\n","96:  For example, a building constructed in 2010 with a 90 year lifespan would meet the guideline if sited to allow for SLR of 1.0 m minimum over Year 2000 levels plus or minus any regional adjustments.\n","97:  When rebuilt in or about 2100 this building would need to accommodate FCL at the time, which might be 2.0m higher than Year 2000 levels, requiring that the building FCL be 1.0 m higher than approved in 2010.\n","98:  The actual required FCL in the year 2200 will not be known with accuracy until much closer to that date.\n","99:  In the building example above, there is ongoing economic use, with the costs of adaptation distributed through the centuries.\n","100:  This approach will minimize the initial costs of considering SLR, and the future costs of adaptation.\n","101:  Beyond examples of individual buildings, the SLR Planning Area approach described in Section 4 provides a method to gradually adapt larger scale land use patterns to SLR including impacts on drainage, access and other factors affecting the land use.\n","102:  Rev: 0 Date: 27 January 2011 Project No: 143111: BC Ministry of Environment/ Climate Change Adaption Guidelines for Sea Dikes and Coastal Flood Hazard Land Use 10 4 4.1 Sea Level Rise (SLR) Planning Areas SLR creates serious risks for public health and property in lowlands on the BC coast.\n","103:  It is necessary to minimize the risk and costs of SLR, to both public and private interests, by proactive planning for future land use.\n","104:  SLR Planning Areas should be defined for both settled and new development areas that are at risk of SLR inundation or related erosion.\n","105:  Extent of SLR Planning Area This section describes how to determine the extent of SLR Planning Areas, and introduces the proposed scope of planning.\n","106:  Figure 4-1 illustrates in concept the proposed SLR Planning Areas.\n","107:  They would extend from the existing Natural Boundary of the sea landward to the contour elevation of a future Flood Construction Level (FCL).\n","108:  Each SLR Planning Area would have two parts: _ SLR Planning Area Year 2100 would extend from Natural Boundary at the sea to the guideline FCL elevation projected for Year 2100.\n","109:  _ SLR Planning Area Year 2200 would extend from Natural Boundary at the sea to the guideline FCL elevation projected for Year 2200.\n","110:  For the purposes of determining the extent of SLR Planning Areas, the presence of existing sea dikes or coastal defences should be ignored.\n","111:  However, if the Management Option selected for the Area is to protect the Area in perpetuity with sea dikes, then the design of the dikes should be considered in the determination of appropriate FCLs.\n","112:  Land use policies must then address the land needs required to upgrade the existing sea dikes.\n","113:  Flood Construction Levels for SLR Planning Areas should be calculated specific to the local conditions of shoreline terrain and vegetation, tides, wind fetch and upland topography.\n","114:  Each location may have a different allowance for High Tide, Sea Level Rise, Storm Surge, and Wave Effects which together with Freeboard determine the FCL.\n","115:  Planning policy and land use designations within the SLR Planning Area must consider how land uses can adapt to the projected future Flood Construction Levels.\n","116:  Rev: 0 Date: 27 January 2011 Project

values of High Tide Level, Total Storm Surge and Wave Effects, and determine resulting FCL including Freeboard; Interpret approximate related location of the Estimated Future Natural Boundary; _ _ Establish a Setback line, shown as the greater of 15m from Estimated Future Natural Boundary or the Contour of the Future FCL; with consideration of potential shoreline erosion or accretion given the shoreline characteristics.\n","118:  It is the intent that all new buildings are provided a 15m setback, to protect from wave and related splash impacts on buildings which may be an increased risk due to SLR; Scope of SLR Planning Area objectives, policies and guidelines, _ for the SLR Planning Area Yr 2100: o Establish requirements for new buildings to meet FCL and Setbacks in accordance with Provincial Guidelines, or to meet flood protection requirements as established by Qualified Professionals.\n","119:  Written design and construction standards from Qualified Professionals should be required for any variance to setbacks at the sea or coastal bluffs; Identify adaptation measures for existing buildings, including approaches to minimize the impacts of flooding from the sea and provisions for evacuation during extreme storm events; In consideration of zoning or rezoning applications; encourage or permit land uses that are compatible with coastal flooding risks; o o o Provide guidelines for land use practices that minimize the impacts of flooding on high value economic and environmental assets.\n","120:  Rev: 0 Date: 27 January 2011 Project No: 143111: BC Ministry of Environment/ Climate Change Adaption Guidelines for Sea Dikes and Coastal Flood Hazard Land Use 13 o Require covenants on title of new buildings or properties to require buildings and land uses to adapt to future SLR and FCL requirements.\n","121:  _ for the SLR Planning Area Yr 2200: o Identify strategies on how proposed land uses and buildings can be adapted to guideline SLR, FCL and Setbacks that might occur in the Year 2200.\n","122:  SLR Planning Area strategies may also include planning dates in addition to Year 2100 and 2200.\n","123:  For instance, existing buildings may have a lifespan that expires in about 2050, and the planning authority may deem it relevant to project requirements to building reconstruction at that date _ perhaps by planning for FCL and Setback requirements for new buildings with a lifespan to Year 2150.\n","124:  Some building uses may have a lifespan of shorter than 100 years.\n","125:  With assistance by Qualified Professionals, it is appropriate to consider whether these shorter lifespans could be considered for reduced approval requirements.\n","126:  However, approving officials are cautioned in these cases to ensure that proponents plan and covenant for adaptation of the next generation of buildings and land uses on the site to SLR at the Year 2100 and Year 2200 or other appropriate thresholds.\n","127:  It is recommended that SLR projections and related FCL requirements should be reviewed in 5 years time (Year 2015) as well as Year 2025 and every 25 years after that at a minimum.\n","128:  The guidelines and requirements in SLR Planning Areas will need to be reviewed in these same intervals, with a focus on updating FCL elevation requirements, which may move up or down as projections for SLR become more accurate.\n","129:  The term of SLR Plans will also move with the review intervals _ with the general intent that SLR planning looks ahead approximately 100 and 200 years from the date of the plan.\n","130:  For example, in the Year 2050 the SLR Planning Area boundaries (FCL contours) may reflect Years 2150 and 2250.\n","131:  Building Setbacks from the Sea In un-diked areas, SLR will have the long-term effect of moving the Natural Boundary landward.\n","132:  This effect will be more pronounced on gently sloping shorelines or low coastal benches than in steeper shoreline terrain or where bedrock is present.\n","133:  Coastal Bluffs will require special consideration.\n","134:  Sea Level Rise may increase the risk of coastal erosion and accelerate the retreat of shorelines.\n","135:  Higher risks will occur on sandy shorelines, with moderate risks at gravel or estuarine settings.\n","136:  The changes in risk will relate to increased frequency of wave action at shorelines and at the toe of related slopes or bluffs.\n","137:  The rate of retreat will be highly dependent on the wind and wave characteristics at the site and the material of the shoreline and backshore bluffs.\n","138:  Where lands are to remain un-diked, setbacks for buildings from the sea must anticipate SLR for the lifespan of the building.\n","139:  Figure 4-4 illustrates SLR to the Year 2100 in a relatively flat and rolling shoreline condition.\n","140:  SLR will increase the elevation of High Tide, and with storm surge, wave effects and freeboard added, the cumulative effect is to increase the Flood Construction Level (FCL) by an amount related to SLR and the local storm exposure.\n","141:  This increase in sea level and wave runup will gradually move the Natural Boundary to a higher level.\n","142:  Building Setback should be established as _the greater of 15 m from the future Estimated Natural Boundary or a distance to where the native land elevation equals the Flood Construction Level_.\n","143:  This setback would apply to non-erodible bedrock cliffs as well as other shoreline types.\n","144:  In cases of coastal bluffs, greater setbacks would apply, consistent with the Land Use Guidelines 2004.\n","145:  4.3 Rev: 0 Date: 27 January 2011 Project No: 143111: BC Ministry of Environment/ Climate Change Adaption Guidelines for Sea Dikes and Coastal Flood Hazard Land Use 14 In Figure 4-4, the steep future shoreline means that the 15m minimum setback from Natural Boundary supersedes the FCL contour elevation.\n","146:  In Figure 4-5, which illustrates the Year 2200 projected condition, additional SLR has moved the future Natural Boundary further inland, and combined with the increase in FCL has made the building constructed in 2010 not fully protected from the sea.\n","147:  The building is also likely to be at the end of its lifespan around 2100.\n","148:  Rebuilding on or after 2100 should undertake a MANAGED RETREAT, and respect the Year 2200 FCL and Setback.\n","149:  If rebuilding is not proposed, the building will be at risk.\n","150:  Short of relocating the building, preparing the lower parts of the building to ACCOMODATE flooding from the sea should be required _ through such measures as leaving only floodable uses such as parking on the lower floor, moving habitable quarters to the upper floor, or using water resistant materials on the lower floor.\n","151:  Figure 4-4: Concept Section of SLR Planning Area Yr 2100 Rev: 0 Date: 27 January 2011 Project No: 143111: BC Ministry of Environment/ Climate Change Adaption Guidelines for Sea Dikes and Coastal Flood Hazard Land Use 15 Figure 4-5: Concept Section of SLR Planning Area Yr 2200 4.4 Land Use Planning Strategies Beyond concerns about individual buildings, the long-term nature of SLR provides an opportunity to minimize risks and impacts by land use planning strategies.\n","152:  During planning for land use and development, careful mapping and planning strategies for SLR Planning Areas will minimize costs and hazards for both the public and private landowners / insurers.\n","153:  Figure 4-6 introduces in plan view, the concept that a SLR Planning Area extent varies with shoreline and backshore terrain.\n","154:  Where shorelines are relatively steep and rocky, typical of bedrock points of land, the minimum 15m setback combined with a steep slope would mean the areal extent of SLR will be limited.\n","155:  In shoreline areas where gentle beaches, beach dunes and flat or rolling backshores exist, SLR impact could affect a considerable land area.\n","156:  A first step in land use planning for SLR is to establish the future FCL allowances for Year 2100 and 2200, and map the associated FCL lines on detailed contour maps.\n","157:  The SLR Planning Area lines will be, in effect, contour lines representing allowances for the FCL levels in Year 2100 and Year 2200.\n","158:  Figure 4-7 shows typical planning responses, at the land use level, to risks of SLR in areas that will not be diked.\n","159:  An initial response should be to concentrate development outside the SLR Planning Area, to AVOID risks associated with SLR.\n","160:  Increases in SLR will gradually move the natural boundary landward.\n","161:  Land use in the area that will be inundated in the future should be managed to adjust to the change in shoreline and to the increased risk of sea flooding during the Designated Storm.\n","162:  Uses such as agriculture, parks, open space and limited industrial or short-term uses would be preferred.\n","163:  In cases of estuarine or coastal wetlands, the zone of wetlands may tend to move shoreward.\n","164:  Where coastal defences or existing rock geology stops the shoreline from moving, intertidal areas Rev: 0 Date: 27 January 2011 Project No: 143111: BC Ministry of Environment/ Climate Change Adaption Guidelines for Sea Dikes and Coastal Flood Hazard Land Use 16 and their associated ecosystems are at risk of being _squeezed out_4.\n","165:  SLR Planning should consider what areas of land should be set aside to allow migration of coastal ecosystems, or to support ecosystem restoration or habitat banking.\n","166:  SLR Planning Areas, or applicant supported studies by Qualified Professionals, should also be used to customize building _setback_ based on coastal risk assessments that consider how SLR combined with wave action and coastal geomorphology may alter shoreline locations, shape and backshore erosion.\n","167:  Guidelines for location of buildings should be based on these planning studies and the expected life of the at-risk asset.\n","168:  Salinization of surface freshwater and groundwater may also increase in shoreline areas, potentially affecting both ecosystems and drinking water supplies from coastal wells.\n","169:  SLR Planning should consider how to mitigate the impacts of salinization.\n","170:  Drainage may also be impeded by higher groundwater levels.\n","171:  Land managers may decide to PROTECT some parts of a SLR Planning Area by building a new dike or placing landfill to meet FCLs.\n","172:  If dikes are used as protection, such areas must meet the requirements of the _Sea Dike Guidelines 2010_.\n","173:  Figure 4-6: Concept Plan of SLR Planning Area Varying with Terrain 4 Technical Report on Local Climate Change Visioning for

use planning administration within SLR Planning Areas, planning authorities may find it useful to establish _areas_ of similar planned structure lifespan, as opposed to allowing a mix of buildings with short, medium and long-term lifespans in a small area.\n","174:  Note, however, this requirement is not intended to discourage mixed land use communities.\n","175:  With new legislative support, a building lifespan requirement could be an added clause to a Development Permit Area or a Zoning Bylaw.\n","176:  Associated with the planned structure lifespan would be a FCL and shoreline setback.\n","177:  A covenant on title would provide legal notice that the FCL and setback rules may change for reconstruction at the end of the structure lifespan period.\n","178:  However, the recommended planning approach is to set FCL based on a precautionary principle and a reasonably long building lifespan (i.e.100 years), and then allow those applicants that need to challenge these FCLs to commission studies by a qualified professional to consider the science and site conditions and recommend a site-specific and structure-specific FCL.\n","179:  This approach is similar to that used in the BC Riparian Area Regulation.\n","180:  In these cases a covenant on title would provide notice on the allowances and restrictions on the land use and structure use, and would give notice that future FCL levels may vary depending on future SLR projections and the lifespan of future buildings.\n","181:  In the meantime until SLR Planning Areas are defined, local governments could consider adding requirements to development information statutes stating that applicants proposing to construct at elevations below those outlined in Table 3-2 provide Qualified Professional expertise to determine appropriate flood protection in keeping with the 2010 Guidelines.\n","182:  This would be an interim measure only until more cost-efficient neighbourhood scale SLR Planning could be done.\n","183:  4.5 Zoning for Risk Land Use Zoning should match land use permissions to the risk of SLR.\n","184:  An example of _Risk Zoning_ is provided in Table 4-1.\n","185:  Rev: 0 Date: 27

_Policy Discussion Document 2010_.\n","210:  Land Use Management Tools Tools that local governments can use to apply one or more of the land use strategies discussed in this chapter include: _ Official Community Plans - hazard land identification and SLR Planning Area designation, _ Zoning bylaws _ _risk zoning_, as discussed above.\n","211:  _ S 910 Flood Plain Bylaw _ OCP Development Permit Area for Protection of Development from Hazardous Conditions _ guidelines and requirements for developing in hazard areas.\n","212:  _ Restrictive covenants.\n","213:  _ Public education _ about the hazards and ways that individuals can address them.\n","214:  _ Early warning and emergency preparedness programs.\n","215:  Requirements for FCL and Setback in the planning documents would vary periodically in accordance with an Adaptive Risk Management approach _ establishing new levels as Sea Level Rise projections become more defined.\n","216:  5.2 On-Going Guidance Examples of different methods of adapting to SLR in southern BC are under development by a parallel project also sponsored by the Natural Resources Canada Regional Adaption Collaborative (RAC)5.\n","217:  5

and Coastal Flood Hazard Land Use 20 6 6.1 6.2 6.3 6.4 Application to Lands Subject to Future Flooding This section applies to land uses that are not protected by Standard Dikes.\n","218:  In areas protected by sea dikes that meet BCMOE requirements, FCLs may not apply and land use behind those sea dikes may not be restricted.\n","219:  Building setbacks will be required on the landside of dikes as needed for dike maintenance and to provide land for future dike raising and reconstruction.\n","220:  Sea Level Rise will create an increasing risk of periodic inundation to existing low lying undeveloped lands along the BC Coast and in lower reaches of river deltas near the Coast.\n","221:  These guidelines are not meant to preclude the use of these lands or of existing structures on these that development of new structures or redevelopment/replacement of existing structures recognizes and can appropriately accommodate the projected impacts of sea level rise on coastal hazards and flooding over time.\n","222:  The goal is to ensure General Guidelines - FCL and Setback The FCL shall be established for specific coastal areas during the SLR Planning Areas process.\n","223:  FCL shall be a minimum elevation for habitable floor level or underside of wood construction, and shall be based on and include allowances for Year 2100 SLR and High Tide levels, associated storm surge and wave effects for the Designated Storm, and Freeboard.\n","224:  Building Setback shall be the greater of 15m from the future Estimated Natural Boundary of the sea at Year 2100, or a horizontal distance until the natural ground elevation contour reaches the Year 2100 projected FCL.\n","225:  Landfill or structural support (e.g.\n","226:  pilings) for a coastal development shall be treated as a Dike structure _ refer to the _Sea Dike Guidelines 2010_ for guidance.\n","227:  Subdivision of Undeveloped Lands All lots created through subdivision shall comply with the general FCL and Setback guidelines noted above.\n","228:  To regulate redevelopment at the end of the building lifespan, the development approving official shall require a restrictive covenant stipulation of reconstruction requirements to meet the FCL and setbacks in force at the time of redevelopment, and identifying the hazard, building requirements, and liability disclaimer if reconstruction does not take place at or before the planned lifespan of the building.\n","229:  Development on Existing Undeveloped Lots On existing lots, if meeting the guidelines noted above would sterilize the lot (i.e., not allow even one of the land uses or structures permitted under the current zoning), the development approving official may agree to modifying setback requirements as recommended by a Qualified Professional, provided this is augmented through a restrictive covenant stipulation of the hazard, building requirements, and liability disclaimer.\n","230:  Lots with Coastal Bluffs For lots containing coastal bluffs that are steeper than 3(H):1(V) and susceptible to erosion from the sea, setbacks shall be determined as follows: Rev: 0 Date: 27 January 2011 Project No: 143111: BC Ministry of Environment/ Climate Change Adaption Guidelines for Sea Dikes and Coastal Flood Hazard Land Use 21 1.\n","231:  6.5 6.6 If the future estimated Natural Boundary is located at least 15m seaward of the toe of the bluff, then no action is required and the setback shall conform with guidelines suitable to terrestrial cliff hazards.\n","232:  If the future estimated Natural Boundary is located 15m or less seaward of the toe of the bluff, then the setback from the future estimated Natural Boundary will be located at a horizontal distance of at least 3 times the height of the bluff, measured from 15m landwards from the location of the future estimated Natural Boundary.\n","233:  In some conditions, setbacks may require site-specific interpretation and could result in the use of a minimum distance measured back from the crest of the bluff.\n","234:  The setback may be modified provided the modification is supported by a report, giving consideration to the coastal erosion that may occur over the life of the project, prepared by a suitably qualified professional.\n","235:  Outside the Strait of Georgia, setback requirements would be similar but should be adapted to include tsunami effects.\n","236:  Land use specific provisions in the existing guidelines would still apply.\n","237:  Renovations or Additions to Existing Buildings Renovations to existing buildings within the existing footprint of the building are not affected by these guidelines.\n","238:  Additions of up to 25% of the floor area, at the elevation of the existing building can be allowed, provided that the addition is no closer to the existing natural boundary than the existing building.\n","239:  Reconstruction of Existing Buildings Replacement or redevelopment of a building on an existing low lying lot must meet the new FCL and Setback guidelines.\n","240:  If meeting the new guidelines would sterilize the lot (i.e., not allow even one of the land uses or structures permitted under the current zoning), the development approving official may agree to modifying setback requirements as recommended by a Qualified Professional, provided this is augmented through a restrictive covenant stipulation of the hazard, building requirements, and liability disclaimer.\n","241:  Outside of the Strait of Georgia the requirements would be similar but adapted to include Tsunami considerations and a 30m minimum setback.\n","242:  Land Use Specific provisions in the existing guideline would still apply.\n","243:  Rev: 0 Date: 27 January 2011 Project No: 143111: BC Ministry of Environment/ Climate Change

Existing definitions are provided below in italics followed by any necessary modification, clarification or addition to the definitions or terminology in the existing documents.\n","247:  Acronyms associated with the definitions that are used in the text are shown in brackets.\n","248:  1.1 Annual Exceedence Probability (AEP) The probability, likelihood or chance of a particular event (e.g., a storm or a storm surge) being equalled or exceeded in any one year.\n","249:  It is defined either as a number between 0 and 1 or as a corresponding percentage.\n","250:  An AEP of 0.01 means there is a 1% chance of an event, of a given magnitude or larger, occurring in any single given year.\n","251:  An AEP of 0.01 or 1/100 yr also suggests that on average, under certain conditions, the Average Return Period, or interval between recurrences of this event, is approximately 100 years.\n","252:  1.2 Average Return Period Over a long period of time, the average number of years between occurrences of a particular event.\n","253:  In general, the average return period is the reciprocal of the AEP _ the relationship is illustrated in the following table: AEP probability 0.5 0.1 0.01 0.005 0.001 0.0005 0.0002 0.0001 AEP per cent 50% 10% 1% 0.5% 0.1% 0.05% 0.02% 0.01% Average Return Period (years) 2 10 100 200 1000 2000 5000 10000 y t i l i b a b o r P s e s a e r c e d 1 Appendix A 1 Using AEP to define the likelihood of hazard events is preferable to the average return period as return period can lead to a false sense of security created by the belief that the indicated number of years will pass before the next event of that magnitude occurs.\n","254:  1.3 Designated Flood A flood, which may occur in any given year, of such a magnitude as to equal a flood having a 200-year recurrence interval based on a frequency analysis of unregulated historic flood records or by regional analysis where there is inadequate streamflow data available.\n","255:  Where the flow of a large watercourse is controlled by a major dam, the designated flood shall be set on a site-specific basis.\n","256:  In coastal areas, the existing definition of a Designated Flood is not appropriate as the probability of flooding from the sea is the result of the joint occurrence of tide and a storm crossing the coastal waters of British Columbia and at some time in the future, sea level rise due to climate change.\n","257:  In estuaries, where a river discharges into the sea, the definition of the Designated Flood applies to the river.\n","258:  In these documents the definition _Designated Flood_ is replaced with the term _Designated Storm_ as defined below.\n","259:  1.4 Designated Flood Level (DFL) The observed or calculated elevation for the Designated Flood and is used in the calculation of the Flood Construction Level.\n","260:  In coastal areas, the Designated Flood Level (DFL) includes the appropriate allowance for future sea level rise, tide and the total storm surge expected during the designated storm.\n","261:  1.5 Designated Storm (DS) A storm, which may occur in any given year, of such a magnitude as to equal a storm having the designated annual exceedence probability (AEP).\n","262:  The Designated Storm has several phenomena associated with it that will define components of the Designated Flood Level, including storm surge, wind set-up, wave run-up and overtopping for the storm.\n","264:  1.6 Diking Authority (a) The commissioners of a district to which Part 2 of the Drainage, Ditch and Dike Act applies, (b) A person owning or controlling a dike other than a private dike, (b1) If the final agreement of a treaty first nation so provides, the treaty first nation in relation to dikes on its treaty lands, Appendix A 2 (c) A public authority designated by the minister as having any responsibility for maintenance of a dike other than a private dike, or (d) A regional district, a municipality or an improvement district.\n","265:  1.7 Flood Construction Level (FCL) Uses the Designated Flood Level plus an allowance for Freeboard to establish the elevation of the underside of a wooden floor system or top of concrete slab for habitable buildings.\n","266:  In the case of a manufactured home, the ground level or top of concrete or asphalt pad, on which it is located, shall be equal to or higher than the above described elevation.\n","267:  It also establishes the minimum crest level of a Standard Dike.\n","268:  Where the Designated Flood Level cannot be determined or where there are overriding factors, an assessed height above the natural boundary of the water-body or above the natural ground elevation may be used (as defined in the Land Use Guidelines 2004).\n","269:  In coastal areas the FCL does not relate to the crest level of a sea dike, nor does it relate to the crest level of flood proofing fill exposed directly to the designated flood level.\n","270:  The FCL does; however, include wave _ structure interaction effects, to be determined at the location of the site of the building.\n","271:  1.8 Flood Construction Reference Plane (FCRP) The vertical elevation of an estimated future Natural Boundary from which the FCL is determined.\n","272:  1.9 Flood Plain A lowland area, whether diked, flood proofed, or not, which, by reasons of land elevation, is susceptible to flooding from an adjoining watercourse, ocean, lake or other body of water and for administration purposes is taken to be that area submerged at the Designated Flood Level.\n","273:  In coastal areas the concept of the Flood Plain has been extended to a _Sea Level Rise Planning Area_; defined below.\n","274:  Special measures may be warranted in this area.\n","275:  1.10 Flood Proofing The alteration of land or structures either physically or in use to reduce flood damage and includes the use of building setbacks from water bodies to maintain a floodway and allow for potential erosion.\n","276:  Flood Proofing may be achieved by all or a combination of the following: _ Building on fill, provided such fill does not interfere with flood flows of the watercourse, and is adequately protected against floodwater erosion _ Building raised by structural means such as foundation walls, columns, etc.\n","277:  _ A combination of fill and structural means.\n","278:  In coastal areas exposed to flooding, construction of fill as a flood proofing measure may substantially increase the freeboard required to define the FCL, if the fill is directly exposed to the Designated Flood Level.\n","279:  In this case, the FCL must be equivalent to the crest level of a sea dike with the same characteristics as the seaward face of the fill.. 1.11 Freeboard A vertical distance added to the Designated Flood Level.\n","280:  Used to establish the Flood Construction Level.\n","281:  Appendix A 3 In coastal areas, the vertical distance to be added to a Designated Flood Level is site and structure specific.\n","282:  1.12 Natural Boundary Means the visible high watermark of any lake, river, stream or other body of water where the presence and action of the water are so common and usual and so long continued in all ordinary years as to mark upon the soil of the bed of the lake, river, stream or other body of water a character distinct from that of the banks thereof, in respect to vegetation, as well as in respect to the nature of the soil itself (Land Act, Section 1).\n","283:  In addition, the natural boundary includes the best estimate of the edge of dormant or old side channels and marsh areas.\n","284:  For coastal areas, the natural boundary shall include the natural limit of permanent terrestrial vegetation.\n","285:  Natural Boundary is an established concept in BC law _ and reflects a change in vegetation and soil based on effects of the sea.\n","286:  In the Flood Hazard Area Land Use Guidelines 2004, building setbacks were established from Natural Boundary, on the unstated assumption that the location of Natural Boundary is relatively static (other than erosions and accretions).\n","287:  Natural boundary is, in practice, often difficult to determine in the field or from remote survey.\n","288:  In coastal areas, the Natural Boundary reflects a snapshot historical record of tide, storm surge and wave runup effects, which may be the mark of a recent storm in an ordinary year or it may be the mark of the most severe storm in recent times.\n","289:  There is no way of knowing for certain.\n","290:  A technical basis for the Natural Boundary in coastal areas is site and time specific.\n","291:  In the future the location and elevation of a Natural Boundary will change from time to time due to changes associated with sea level rise and it will likely lag sea level rise.\n","292:  It is also unlikely to immediately reflect the action of the water, especially the storm surge and waves, during a Designated Storm.\n","293:  1.13 Project Life The number of years a particular project; including a sea dike, a building or a community, is intended to serve before it is replaced, upgraded or dismantled.\n","294:  Regular maintenance to ensure the project provides the intended purpose is expected during the project life.\n","295:  1.14 Sea Dike A dike, floodwall or any other thing that prevents flooding of land by the sea.\n","296:  As defined in the Dike Maintenance Act, _dike_ means _an embankment, wall, fill, piling, pump, gate, flood box, pipe, sluice, culvert, canal, ditch, drain_.\n","297:  1.15 Sea Dike Crest Elevation Sea Dike Crest Elevation has essentially the same meaning as _dike crest height_ in the existing document _Dike Design and Construction Guide 2003_.\n","298:  However, the existing definition of dike height suggests that consideration of wave run-up and set-up is optional.\n","299:  The term Sea Dike Crest Elevation is defined to specifically cover scenarios where wave run- up, overtopping and wind and wave setup must be included in defining the height of the dike.\n","300:  1.16 Sea Dike System A system of: dikes, dunes, berms or natural shorelines that provide a similar function; and associated engineering works (e.g., tidal gates, outfalls, outlet structures, seawalls, quay walls, ramps, adjacent building features, etc.)\n","301:  used to protect land from flooding or inundation.\n","302:  In the Netherlands where dike systems are highly evolved, a dike system is termed a _dike ring_ that forms the flooding defence for a region.\n","304:  In BC, multiple Diking Authorities may share responsibility for the same sea dike system.\n","305:  1.17 Sea Level Rise (SLR) An allowance for increases in the mean elevation of the ocean associated with future climate change, including any regional effects such as crustal subsidence or uplift.\n","306:  1.18 Sea Level Rise Planning Area (SLR Planning Area) An area of land that may be subject to future flooding due to Sea Level Rise.\n","307:  This area defines a future coastal flood plain.\n","308:  The SLR Planning Area extends from the existing Natural Boundary landward to the highest predicted point of potential flooding related to SLR plus flooding expected from the combination of high tide, total storm surge and expected wave runup during the Designated Storm.\n","309:  Predictions of SLR for the SLR Planning Area definition shall use best predictions for minimum periods of 90-100 years and 200 years forward.\n","310:  From time to time, both the Natural Boundary and the predictions for SLR are subject to change, and therefore the extent of a SLR Planning Area may be revised at regular intervals in the future.\n","311:  1.19 Seastate The term _seastate_ is used to encapsulate, in a general way, all of the parameters and characteristics that may be needed during design to define the waves at a given instant in time.\n","312:  The sea state is the general condition of the free surface of a body of water_with respect to wind waves and swell_at a certain location and moment.\n","313:  The sea state is characterized by statistics, including wave height(s), period(s), distribution and power spectrum.\n","314:  The sea state varies with time, as the weather or oceanographic factors change.\n","315:  For engineering purposes the seastate is often characterized by the significant wave height, Hs.\n","316:  1.20 Setback Means withdrawal or siting of a building or landfill away from the natural boundary or other reference line to maintain a floodway and to allow for potential land erosion.\n","317:  1.21 Standard Dikes Dikes built to a minimum crest elevation equal to the Flood Construction Level and meeting standards of design and construction approved by the Ministry of Environment and maintained by an ongoing authority such as a local government body.\n","318:  1.22 Storm Surge A change in water level caused by the action of wind and atmospheric pressure variation on the sea surface.\n","319:  The typical effect is to raise the level of the sea above the predicted astronomical tide level, although in some situations, such as when winds blow offshore, the actual water level may be lower than that predicted.\n","320:  The magnitude of a storm surge on the BC coast will be dependent on the severity and duration of the storm event in the North Pacific, its track relative to the BC coast and the seabed bathymetry at the site.\n","321:  1.23 Total Storm Surge The combination of the storm surge generated in deep water plus the additional local surge or wind setup generated by the effect of the winds during the Designated Storm over shallow Appendix A 5 water at a particular site.\n","322:  In general the deep water storm surge is nearly the same as that recorded at a tidal gauging station.\n","323:  Additional surge may occur at other sites.\n","324:  For planning purpose, winds during a Designated Storm will start to generate local surge in water depths less than 30 m. 1.24 Wave Run-up The vertical distance that waves run-up the seaward slope of a structure or a shoreline.\n","325:  The vertical distance is measured from the mean water level, which is the same as the Designated Flood Level.\n","326:  For coastal flooding hazard management the Wave Run-up is taken as 50 per cent of the calculated run-up elevation on the natural shoreline.\n","327:  This ratio is based on analysis completed for this assignment (2010) and may be revised as more information becomes available.\n","328:  For defining a Sea Dike Crest Elevation the Wave Run-up is taken to be the vertical distance exceeded by no more than 2% of the waves during the Designated Storm at the toe of the sea dike 1.25 Wave Set-up An increase in mean water surface close to the shoreline caused by wave action; important during storm events as it results in a further increase in water level above the tide and surge levels, landward of the location where waves start to break.\n","329:  Wave set-up will lead to larger waves existing at the seaward toe of a sea dike than might otherwise be expected.\n","330:  1.26 Wave Overtopping The passage of water over the top of a sea dike as a result of wave runup or related surge and setup.\n","331:  Water overtopping a sea dike may pass over the dike as a flow of water or as spray and the specific characteristics are site and structure specific.\n","332:  1.27 Wind Set-up A rise of the water surface above the water level on the open coast due to the local action of wind stress on the water surface.\n","333:  2 Acronyms and Symbols 2.1 CD Tide and chart datum _ in Canadian waters the plane below which the tide will seldom fall.\n","334:  Tide datum and chart datum is usually the same provided the chart is the largest scale available chart for area.\n","335:  For a site specific survey tide and chart (sounding) datum may be different and the specifics should be stated explicitly.\n","336:  2.2 CGD Canadian Geodetic Datum.\n","337:  In 2010 the vertical reference plane in Canada is in the process of being changed from a MSL related datum plane _ technically known as CGVD28 _ to a geoid at http://www.geod.nrcan.gc.ca/hm/index_e.php.\n","338:  The term CGD is taken to mean the datum as defined in 2010 and approximately equal to

Fundamentals and Definitions for BC Coastal Flood Hazard Rev: 0 Date: 27 January 2011 Project No: 143111: BC Ministry of Environment/ Climate Change Adaption Guidelines for Sea Dikes and Coastal Flood Hazard Land Use Appendix B Contents 1 2 Introduction Fundamental Concepts in BC Coastal Flood Hazard 1 1 Appendix B 1 2 Introduction The incorporation of Sea Level Rise considerations into an update of the existing documents for the BC Ministry of Environment is structured into three documents: Policy Discussion Paper 2010 Sea Dike Guidelines 2010 Guidelines for Management of Coastal Flood Hazard Land Use 2010 To aid the reader in understanding the updates to the existing documents there is a need to understand fundamental concepts and definitions relating to BC Coastal Flood Hazards.\n","342:  This Appendix provides a summary of the fundamental concepts and definitions.\n","343:  Fundamental Concepts in BC Coastal Flood Hazard The existing document: Flood Hazard Area Land Use Guidelines 2004 was focussed on river flood risks.\n","344:  The section on flooding by the sea (Section 3.5) did not fully anticipate sea level rise and assumed a static sea level.\n","345:  Sea Level Rise (SLR) is now understood to be a certainty in the future and very likely to result in an increase of 1.0 m by 2100.\n","346:  However, the rate and height of SLR has considerable uncertainty.\n","347:  The Policy Discussion Paper 2010 summarizes the range of projections for SLR that apply to BC.\n","348:  Figure B1 illustrates the elements relating to the risks from the sea in the existing Flood Hazard Area Land Use Guidelines 2004.\n","349:  Figure B1: Coastal Flood Hazard _ Existing (2004) Definitions Appendix B 1 In Figure B1, Mean Sea Level is essentially the same as the terrestrial vertical datum plane of Canadian Geodetic Datum = 0 m. The tides, which are nominally centred about mean sea level, are established by the definable gravitational interactions between the earth, the sun and the moon and are reasonably predicable.\n","350:  Although the difference between mean tide and high tide varies from place to place and from time to time, these levels are defined by the Canadian Hydrographic Service and available for many locations in coastal British Columbia.\n","351:  The Natural Boundary shown on Figure B1 is an established concept in BC law _ and reflects the change in vegetation and the soil based on effects of the sea.\n","352:  In the Flood Hazard Area Land Use Guidelines 2004, building setbacks were established from Natural Boundary, on the assumption that the location of Natural Boundary was relatively static (other than erosions and accretions).\n","353:  The Natural boundary is, in practice, often difficult to determine in the field or from remote survey.\n","354:  Flood Construction Level (FCL) is established in the 2004 Guidelines as a general minimum of 1.5m above the elevation of the Natural Boundary at the Sea.\n","356:  _ Bedrock or designed shore protection might allow a reduced setback.\n","358:  _ Lands outside the Strait of Georgia are subject to tsunami hazard, and that generally prevails over the sea flooding guideline; _ Lands exposed to other sources of flooding e.g.\n","359:  from river estuaries, may have flooding hazards that are higher than the requirements for a hazard from the sea.\n","360:  Figure B2 provides a more detailed interpretation of the flooding concepts for the sea in the the existing Flood Hazard Area Land Use Guidelines 2004.\n","361:  In particular: _ The location of the Natural Boundary is generally higher and further inland than the location of the line marking predicable High Tide.\n","362:  Two natural processes essentially then define the location of Natural Boundary: o The water level during an _ordinary year_, which results in water and wave actions strong enough to mark the shoreline sediments in a distinct manner.\n","363:  Implicitly this suggests that it is likely associated with a commonly occurring storm or _Ordinary Storm_.\n","364:  _ o Wave related actions during the _Ordinary Storm_.\n","365:  the 1.5m additional vertical requirement that defines the Flood Construction Level therefore needs to account for two additional considerations: o an additional allowance for storm surge and wave effects for conditions greater than the _Ordinary Storm_.\n","366:  o A Freeboard allowance.\n","367:  These considerations are shown in Figure B2.\n","368:  If a freeboard allowance of 0.6 m is considered, based on the freeboard allowance in the existing companion document Dike Appendix B 2 Design and Construction Guide 20031, then an amount of 0.9 m remains to account for storm surge and wave effects for conditions greater than the _Ordinary Storm_.\n","369:  An allowance of 0.9 m is a reasonable allowance in many situations to allow for a rise in the total water level during a severe storm.\n","370:  Figure B2: Coastal Flood Hazard - Interpretation of Existing 2004 Definitions Figure B3 extends this interpretation of the Existing Definitions to include a specific allowance for Sea Level Rise (SLR) and the expected effects during a _Designated Storm_ _ i.e.\n","371:  : a storm that meets a stated risk criteria.\n","373:  (See Definitions in Appendix A).\n","374:  1 _Dike Design and Construction Guide _ Best Management Practices for British Columbia_, July 2003, published by the Province of British Columbia, Ministry of Water, Land and Air Protection (now the Ministry of Environment) Appendix B 3 Figure B3: Coastal Flood Hazard _ Adaptation for Climate Change Sea Level Rise will gradually raise both the mean sea level (MSL) and the tidal levels along the BC Coast.\n","375:  Both MSL and tidal levels will rise in approximately equal amounts in response to SLR.\n","376:  For example, if the MSL rises 1.0m, all tide levels, including High Tide, also will rise by 1.0m.\n","377:  Over time this will mean that MSL is no longer approximately the same as the terrestrial vertical datum plane (CGD), unless the terrestrial datum plane is adjusted at the same rate.\n","378:  As sea level rises, the storms that occur will leave a mark on the slowly changing shoreline.\n","379:  In particular the _Designated Storm_ will define; in conjunction with the local coastal exposure, the nearshore bathymetry, shoreline orientation and topography, a Total Storm Surge and an additional wave related runup (Wave Effects).\n","380:  The combination of antecedent storms and the Designated Storm will move the existing Natural Boundary landward to a new Natural Boundary location at the top of the wave affected zone.\n","381:  At any given time in the future, the actual mark of this tide, storm and wave action will reflect the latest storm events, which may or may not be _ordinary_ and the response of the particular stretch of shoreline.\n","382:  It is recommended that a combination of the _Designated Flood Level_ and an estimate of the expected shoreline response be used to establish the future Estimated Natural Boundary for planning purposes, as this is a more predictable and practical tool than relying on future vegetation or soil response interpretations, in particular when SLR changes may be faster than the new shoreline sediment or vegetation responds.\n","383:  It is also not clear that at any particular time the mark on the shoreline will reflect an _ordinary_ year.\n","384:  The elevation of this Estimated Natural Boundary location is defined as the Flood Construction Reference Plane (FCRP).\n","385:  To calculate the FCL a Freeboard allowance is added above the Flood Construction Reference Plane (FCRP) to allow for uncertainty.\n","386:  This Freeboard allowance may include Appendix B 4 uncertainties in the future changes to storm surge, wave run-up, and the effects of sea level rise on delta flooding and coastal sediment supply.\n","387:  The Freeboard allowance should be the greater of: _ 0.6m, or; _ For flood proofing fill _ crest elevation of equivalent sea dike (see Sea Dike Guidelines 2010) _ For exposed vertical building foundations _ the wave-structure interaction; _ For tsunami areas _ the runup elevation of the appropriate tsunami hazard.\n","388:  In summary the general concept for calculating Future Flood Construction Level with SLR Allowance is: _ Future SLR Allowance + _ Maximum High Tide (HHWLT) + _ Storm Surge During Designated Storm + _ Wave Effects During Designated Storm + _ Freeboard Allowance The FCL calculation will vary for a given target year, and will vary for local areas in calculation of both High Tide as well as storm surge and wave effects.\n","389:  Appendix B 5 Appendix C _ Sample Planning Wording Rev: 0 Date: 27 January 2011 Project No: 143111: BC Ministry of Environment/ Climate Change Adaption Guidelines for Sea Dikes and Coastal Flood Hazard Land Use Appendix C Contents 1 Sample Planning Wording 1 Appendix C 1 Sample Planning Wording The Official Community Plan Policies Template (Form 1, Appendix B of the existing guideline document Land Use Guidelines 20041) should have the following statement appended: _In coastal and estuarine lowland areas of BC, Sea Level Rise may increase the risks of flooding to existing and proposed developments.\n","390:  The OCP text and maps describe Sea Level Rise Planning Areas and associated Flood Construction Levels based on best current Sea Level Rise projections.\n","391:  The OCP and maps describe the locations and Flood Construction Levels for buildings based on the planned building lifespan.\n","392:  Where buildings are to be constructed within the SLR planning area, they shall be subject to a restrictive covenant stipulation of the hazard, building requirements, and liability disclaimer_ The text of the OCP should also state that the policies related to Sea Level Rise will be subject to refinement as more data and information becomes available on SLR elevations and risks for the plan area.\n","393:  1 Flood Hazard Area Land Use Management Guidelines, May 2004, prepared by the Ministry of Water, Land and Air Protection (now Ministry of Environment) Appendix C 1\n","394:  guidebook livia-rev-final:Layout 1 12/23/08 9:24 AM Page 1 CANADIAN COMMUNITIES_ GUIDEBOOK FOR ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE Including an approach to generate mitigation co-benefits in the context of sustainable development Livia Bizikova Tina Neale Ian Burton First Edition guidebook livia-rev-final:Layout 1 12/23/08 9:24 AM Page 2 This report may be cited as: Bizikova L., T.

Page 9 CANADIAN COMMUNITIES_ GUIDEBOOK FOR ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE foreword Since the Brundtland Commission Report published in 1987, in both developed and developing countries, the term _sustainable development_ has become an important concept among the science and policy making communities.\n","420:  In the first few years, it was more predominantly within all economic sectors.\n","421:  Gradually _sustainable development_ has evolved as a multidisciplinary topic where every discipline has a stake.\n","422:  Climate change has emerged as one of the most crucial environmental challenges of the 21st century.\n","424:  In the IPCC processes, it has received increasing importance and currently the deep and multiple links between development and climate change are acknowledged, emphasizing the need to move climate policy into the broader context of development, equity, poverty reduction and sustainability.\n","425:  However, this is a challenging task.\n","426:  This Guidebook builds on the rich experiences of researchers within Environment Canada_s Adaptation and Impacts Research Division (AIRD) working with decision-makers on practical projects focused on climate change and sustainable development.\n","427:  It provides a process closely tied to on-going planning cycles to help decision-makers incorporate climate change science, impacts, adaptation and mitigation solutions into their sustainable development initiatives.\n","428:  This Guidebook provides the needed assistance in help Canadians interpret the potential consequences of climate change impacts in the local context and how to develop adaptation actions and responses to address the anticipated consequences.\n","429:  Our intent was to produce this Guidebook as a tool for planners, decision-makers, local practitioners and investors to help build wealthier, healthier, safer and more resilient communities.\n","430:  Around the world local governments and communities are taking a leading role in adaptation and mitigation to climate change.\n","432:  Don MacIver 9 guidebook livia-rev-final:Layout 1 12/23/08 9:25 AM Page 10 CANADIAN COMMUNITIES_ GUIDEBOOK FOR ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE executive summary Many local governments have already begun working on decreasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.\n","433:  Recently, a growing number have begun examining ways to adapt to climate change _ the act of reducing climate change impacts that are already underway.\n","434:  This Guidebook is intended to help those who are looking for ways to reduce the impacts of climate change (increasing heat waves, water shortages, intense storms and sea-level rise) while decreasing GHG emissions and ensuring sustainable development for their communities.\n","435:  Several different methods can be used to adapt to climate change.\n","436:  Some of these methods contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions while increasing long-term sustainability.\n","437:  Expanding the tree canopy in urban centres, for example, helps to reduce the impact of an increasing number of hot days and heat waves.\n","438:  It also reduces the need for air conditioning, and so reduces greenhouse gas emissions from fossil-fueled electricity generation.\n","440:  Climate change impacts will affect societies in complex and broad-ranging ways as technological, economic, social and ecological changes take place across regions, groups and sectors.\n","441:  Ecological impacts have cascading effects on social and health outcomes.\n","443:  Cities, regions and countries are linked through the global political economic system so that impacts in one area of the world may affect other areas through economic forces, such as prices for agricultural products, or pressures including international migration.\n","444:  In North America, vulnerability to climate change will depend on the effectiveness and timing of adaptation, as well as the distribution of coping capacity.\n","445:  While Canada has considerable adaptive capacity when compared to many less developed nations, vulnerability and adaptive capacity are not uniform across our society.\n","447:  Community attributes, including social networks, social cohesion, volunteerism, economic and income diversification, contribute to adaptive capacity and resilience.\n","448:  Societal impacts will therefore depend on factors such as wealth, infrastructure quality, emergency preparedness, healthcare, community vitality, economic and governance system structure, and population growth.\n","449:  Adaptation, Mitigation and Sustainable development (SAM) are often developed separately at the local government and community level.\n","450:  Recognition of the need to integrate climate risks into development priorities and decision making is the principal driving force behind the development of the SAM project.\n","451:  A number of methods are possible for the integration of adaptation and mitigation in the context of sustainable development.\n","452:  This Guidebook provides one such method.\n","453:  10 guidebook livia-rev-final:Layout 1

couverts arbor_s dans les centres urbains, par exemple, aide _ r_duire l_impact des jours et des vagues de chaleur plus fr_quents.\n","469:  De telles initiatives r_duisent _galement les besoins de climatisation et, de ce fait, diminuent les _missions de gaz _ effet de serre engendr_es par la production d__lectricit_ au moyen de combustibles fossiles.\n","470:  En outre, des arbres sains permettent d_att_nuer les r_percutions des pluies abondantes, de l__coulement des eaux pluviales et de la pollution, tout en augmentant la durabilit_ de nos collectivit_s.\n","471:  Les mani_res, complexes et vari_es, dont les changements climatiques touchent les soci_t_s, diff_rent en fonction des changements technologiques, _conomiques, sociaux et _cologiques que rencontrent les divers groupes, r_gions et secteurs.\n","472:  Et les cons_quences _cologiques ont _ leur tour des r_percutions sur la soci_t_ et la sant_.\n","473:  Les probl_mes d_infrastructure affectent profond_ment l__conomie comme le prouve la facture estim_e _ 10 millions de dollars _ la suite de la panne de courant de 2003 survenue en Am_rique du Nord.\n","474:  Les villes, les r_gions et les pays sont tous li_s entre eux par le syst_me politico-_conomique mondial.\n","475:  Cela implique donc que les probl_mes d_une r_gion du monde peuvent avoir des incidences sur d_autres r_gions, notamment par les forces _conomiques telles que le prix des produits issus de l_agriculture et les pressions comme la migration internationale.\n","476:  Le degr_ de vuln_rabilit_ de l_Am_rique du Nord face aux changements climatiques d_pendra de sa capacit_ _ s_adapter de mani_re rapide et efficace, mais aussi de la r_partition _ diff_rents niveaux de la capacit_ d_adaptation.\n","477:  Bien que le Canada ait une capacit_ d_adaptation consid_rable, comparativement _ bon nombre de pays moins d_velopp_s, on constate n_anmoins que la vuln_rabilit_ et la capacit_ d_adaptation ne sont pas les m_mes dans toute notre soci_t_.\n","478:  Les populations d_savantag_es sur le plan _conomique et social ont potentiellement moins de capacit_ d_adaptation que le reste de la population, et les impr_vus climatiques peuvent mettre en _vidence des difficult_s d_adaptation qui autrement resteraient inconnues (p. ex.\n","479:  la temp_te de verglas de 1998, l_ouragan Katrina ou la vague de chaleur de

the possibility for agreement and action are much greater than at the global level.\n","511:  It is this line of reasoning and the acknowledgement that adaptation, mitigation and sustainable development are often developed separately, and need to be considered together, that brought about the SAM initiative.\n","512:  SAM (Sustainable development, Adaptation and Mitigation) emerged from a number of seminars and discussions, including two workshops held in British Columbia in 2006 and 2008 involving a group of academic researchers, government scientists and local community representatives.\n","513:  These concepts were revised and further developed for practical application in consultation with community and provincial level stakeholders.\n","514:  To date, SAM has been piloted in two case studies in British Columbia in the communities of Richmond and Quesnel.\n","515:  This Guidebook promotes adaptation and mitigation in the context of sustainable development at the local level and provides a set of consecutive steps and information that are: (cid:129) Proactive: SAM approaches are proactive in that they help local governments create that prepare communities for future climatic, policy and development challenges.\n","516:  responses (cid:129) Collaborative: SAM approaches are collaborative;

dimensions.\n","544:  This concept incorporates the notion that for continued human progress, development must find pathways that achieve economic goals, find a balance with the physical environment and promote social well-being, while using political strategies to reach these priorities.\n","545:  Linking the concept of sustainable development to climate change provides an opportunity to explore long-term societal responses to global environmental change.\n","546:  Since industrialization, we have been significantly increasing the concentration of GHGs in the atmosphere.\n","547:  Despite technological progress and available clean technologies, we have failed to reduce our environmental impact or drastically reduce emissions.\n","548:  In many instances, development has placed more of an emphasis on present and short-term well-being at the expense of future generations.\n","549:  The significance of sustainable development options in increasing capacities to adapt and reducing GHG emissions leads to an important message that could help guide responses to climate change at the level of local governments: there is a strong link between climate change, increasing GHGs and our development decisions.\n","550:  Furthermore, only those responses to climate change that meet the criteria of sustainable development and help build resilient communities will be effective in the long-run.\n","552:  Building more green roofs, using hybrid cars and increasing habitable space to protect communities from flooding are desirable changes, however, they will have little impact if we

develop on floodplains and vulnerable coasts.\n","553:  Sustainable, low-emission development actions occur at two different levels: first, large collective decisions that will determine the framework within which we adapt and mitigate, including urban form, land use, transportation infrastructure, energy and water systems; and second, cultural, social and psychological dimensions of values, lifestyle and consumption behaviour (Robinson, 2008).\n","554:  Working toward resilient and sustainable communities will require promoting climate change responses within sustainable development strategies and actions.\n","555:  However, even if we achieve low GHG emissions globally, we will still experience changes in climate due to the presence of historical emissions, therefore, actions that help us adapt to climate change are necessary.\n","556:  Responses to climate change: adaptation and mitigation There have been two main responses to climate change: mitigation and adaptation.\n","557:  In the context of climate change, mitigation is defined as _implementing policies to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and enhance sinks_, while adaptation to climate change is defined as, _[an] adjustment in natural or human systems in response to actual or expected climatic stimuli or their effects, which moderates harm or exploits beneficial opportunities_ (IPCC 2007).\n","558:  There is increasing recognition that the world_s current progress on reducing greenhouse gas emissions is not occurring rapidly enough to avoid impacts from climate change in the coming century.\n","559:  Because of this, the world is _committed_ to a certain level of global warming and therefore, subject to a degree of impacts that will require adaptive responses by nations and communities.\n","560:  Examples of types of adaptation are listed in Table 2.\n","561:  TYPES OF ADAPTATION Type of Adaptation Example Level of Involvement ANTICIPATORY REACTIVE Diversifying

mitigation and adaptation have been considered separately in the global climate change discussion.\n","562:  However, there is increasing recognition that both mitigation and adaptation efforts are necessary in order to decrease climate risks and capture co-benefits.\n","563:  At the level of actual actions, adaptation is needed now and can provide immediate and short term benefits.\n","564:  Mitigation is equally urgent in order to prevent future anthropogenic interference with the climate system, and will only begin to have an effect on global mean surface temperature decades from now.\n","566:  But, both adaptation and mitigation are essential: adaptation to reduce impacts in the near term and mitigation to reduce long term impacts.\n","567:  One could imagine that adapting to a several metre rise in sea level might be a theoretical possibility - it would mean massive economic losses and substantial displacement of population _ not something we want to envision as our future development pathway.\n","568:  Linking mitigation and adaptation at the local level is likely to highlight interactions between these two types of climate change actions.\n","569:  Mitigation measures can increase local vulnerability to climate change, and measures for adaptation can increase the local emissions of GHG _ unless they are considered together.\n","570:  For example, efforts to reduce GHG emissions could include the concentration of housing development with renewable energy close to a town centre, while an adaptation strategy could dictate that if the town centre is located close to a river prone to flooding it would be desirable to locate new housing sufficiently far away from the centre.\n","571:  From a practical point of view, designing local responses that simultaneously address the issues of climate change and sustainability is a challenging task.\n","572:  To help identify possible synergies and trade-offs between mitigation and adaptation activities, it may be useful to consider the four categories of interactions presented in Figure 1.\n","574:  Activities that fall into the upper right quadrant represent the opposite condition: activities that build on the synergies between adaptation and mitigation and reduce both climate vulnerability and GHG emissions.\n","575:  Water conservation is an example of this type of activity and it is also an example of a sustainable development measure.\n","576:  The other two quadrants represent trade-offs created by focusing solely on mitigation or adaptation and, consequently, further increasing vulnerability or levels of GHG emissions (Cohen and Waddell, 2009).\n","577:  20 CANADIAN COMMUNITIES_ GUIDEBOOK FOR ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE guidebook livia-rev-final:Layout 1 12/23/08 9:25 AM

Wasagamack.\n","589:  To get there, one flies from Winnipeg in a Dash-8 due north for about an hour to St. Teresa Point.\n","590:  From there transport is a small boat with an outboard motor for 30 minutes to Wasagamack _ a community to which almost everything must travel by plane and then boat.\n","591:  One morning I was having breakfast with some of the organizers of the work.\n","592:  I picked up a jar of jam that was on the table.\n","593:  French mango and pineapple jam.\n","594:  Wait a minute, I thought to myself, mangoes and pineapples don_t grow in France.\n","595:  How many times has whatever fruit there is in this jar been around the planet to make it into my hands in Wasagamack?\n","596:  And worse than that _ if I wasn_t preparing for a project on global warming, this thought would likely never have entered my mind.\n","597:  Because for some reason, I am entitled to eat mango and pineapple jam from France.\n","598:  So, there I was spiraling into a vortex of guilt and despair and, not wanting to endure that alone, decided to share the thought with my colleagues at the table; social justice activists each and every one of us.\n","599:  Upon doing so, one of them, in a very weary voice said, _Can_t we just have breakfast?_ Understanding and sympathizing with the fatigue_.I shut my mouth.\n","601:  Of course governments need to develop clear and well thought out policies to deal with this most important issue.\n","602:  Likewise, corporations must change their destructive behaviour on the planet.\n","603:  I have questions, though, if either of these necessities will have much meaning if each and every one of us humans don_t confront our own expectations, entitlements and patterns of behaviour that create the intricate web that both supports, and is, the unsustainable culture in which we live.\n","604:  David Diamond is a co-founder and the Artistic and Managing Director of Headlines Theatre.\n","605:  In 2007 and 2008 Headlines

present status and trends.\n","723:  Where are we heading?\n","724:  2A: Examining current development challenges, planning principles and capacities This step is focused on examining local vulnerability and available capacities.\n","725:  By looking at currently applied principles and projections in local development (population growth scenarios, planned coastal and flood plain development, zoning, changes in the use of agricultural land, green spaces and parks) and assessing them for their potential to address current and future challenges from climatic and non-climatic stresses, local vulnerabilities and adaptive capacities can be assessed.\n","726:  Attention needs to be given to evaluating the extent of collaboration between different departments, since addressing climate change and sustainability requires moving away from _silos_ and instead promoting collaboration between sectors.\n","729:  (cid:129) The local context frames adaptation and migration options.\n","731:  For example, to respond to flooding we could think of flood attenuation and storage; upstream land management; permanent flood defences including ring dikes around vulnerable areas; diversion of flood flows; setting back river edge flood defences to make space for water; changing the configuration of the coastline; green roofs; widening drains; managing flood pathways; raising floor levels; free-standing flood barriers; removable household products; and increasing habitable space.\n","732:  However, the option selected depends not only on the impact, but also on current and future local priorities.\n","734:  Many local governments have already created working groups on sustainability in which they strive to avoid narrowly focused policies that often neglect social or environmental benefits.\n","735:  Similar approaches are needed to progress with the responses to climate change.\n","736:  (cid:129) Finally, obtaining information about the community will help to establish which measures are feasible in the short and long-terms, with regard to current and future development plans and available capacities.\n","737:  The completion of these actions will provide information about the state of local development, capacities and local vulnerability.\n","738:  To address them, a number of methods can be utilized.\n","739:  We suggest conducting a series of interviews, but these actions could also be discussed using focus groups (details about both methods are in Appendix 1).\n","740:  To do this, the project team could collaborate with researchers to help conduct the analyses and summarize the results.\n","741:  This exercise will help to determine capacities and applied principles, and scenarios in local planning.\n","742:  One way to proceed further is to discuss the report in a meeting involving a project team and the researchers working on the SAM project.\n","743:  This could be used in the workshop setting to create a common ground for completing the list of actions.\n","744:  A project team should gather information on a series of issues and develop a report on the assessment of current areas of strengths and weaknesses in responding to current challenges, including weather-related events.\n","745:  This step provides information about whether current plans and priorities are effective to address current vulnerability and what are the available capacities to address these vulnerabilities.\n","746:  It also provides important inputs for the next step by listing information needs of the practitioners in regards to climate change impacts.\n","747:  32 CANADIAN COMMUNITIES_ GUIDEBOOK FOR ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE guidebook livia-rev-final:Layout 1 12/23/08 9:25 AM Page 33 GUIDEBOOK FOR ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE

the climatic and non-climatic (if needed) variables or factors that affect the problem you are looking to address with your SAM project.\n","749:  Consider changes in level of GHGs as well.\n","750:  Identify socio-economic scenarios that are currently used in local planning processes.\n","752:  Assess to what extent current plans, policies and regulations account for the identified set of variables and their further changes.\n","755:  How do they present challenges or barriers?\n","756:  Identify impacts of present day weather patterns (temperatures, precipitation, etc.)\n","757:  and severe weather events (windstorms, heat waves, cold snaps, rainstorms, thunderstorms, snowfalls etc.)\n","758:  on sector/infrastructure related to the focus of your initiative 5.\n","759:  Discuss

information that you need gather in order to make effective decisions about adapting to climate change in issues related to the focus of your initiative (i.e., changes in design or operation of current systems to cope with changing weather patterns expected because of climate change).\n","763:  This could include: _ _ _ _ Local projections of climatic variables (precipitation, sea level rise, wind, flooding, snow melt); Local consequences of the impacts (changes in local river hydrology, changes in ground water availability, impacts on slope stability, occurrence of pest and diseases etc.)\n","764:  Best practices for adapting to climate change, that have been applied in similar conditions to your location Information on low-carbon technological options that could address climate

coast Focus, objectives and team in the adaptation initiative: To use storm surge mapping to predict the impact of the design storm at current and projected sea levels.\n","766:  The project was initiated in 1998, by the Clean Annapolis River Project (CARP), a non-governmental organization in collaboration with the town of Annapolis Royal, focused on mapping storm surge.\n","767:  Current vulnerability and capacities: With an average tidal range of 10 metres and an average frequency of two hurricane-type storms every three years, the Bay of Fundy and its surrounding coastal towns are susceptible to storm surges.\n","768:  Much of the inhabited land bordering the Bay is at or below sea level, having been reclaimed by Acadian settlers in the 17th century with an elaborate system of dykes.\n","769:  The dykes, which now protect a large population and economically significant agricultural lands, have been maintained and upgraded based on a historical design from 1869.\n","770:  However, if projected impacts of climate change lead to unprecedented storm surges, they would surpass the dykes and overwhelm the coping capacity of the communities.\n","771:  Estimated impacts of changing climate: CARP encountered many obstacles in their efforts because the data critical to the completion of the exercise, like elevation maps with reasonably small contour intervals, were either non-existent or difficult to access.\n","772:  Nonetheless, they succeeded in generating maps, which indicated that much of the town would be flooded, and that critical infrastructure such as the fire department could be marooned from the rest of the community.\n","773:  Responses to climate change and their implementation: Resulting adaptations in the risk management strategy included the re-distribution of some emergency response equipment and the purchase of a boat by the fire department.\n","774:  The maps also led to the organization of a mock disaster scenario to engage the public in disaster management planning.\n","775:  CARP has since pursued some saltmarsh restoration in the Bay, a natural solution that can help reduce the impact of storm surges.\n","776:  The maps indicated the need for changes in town planning and protection strategies.\n","777:  Presently, adaptation strategies include reviewing the emergency preparedness plans, improving the early warning system and collaboration with a number of departments and institutions to ensure the effectiveness of the early warning systems.\n","778:  Sources: Belbin and Clyburn (1998); Danard, Munro and Murty

2 2B.\n","779:  Estimating impacts of climate change The purpose of this step is to estimate the impacts of climate change in the context of the SAM project.\n","780:  The previous two steps set the context for the climate change impacts.\n","781:  Except in areas of high vulnerability, climate change is usually not a major driver of changes in development policies and plans.\n","782:  Even so, it can act as a significant stressor that may influence the direction of local development and vice versa.\n","783:  In particular, climate change is most likely to have significant implications for development by interacting with other stresses on sustainable development.\n","784:  For example, in areas where the aging infrastructure is under pressure because of the growing population and for maintenance, further stresses due to climate change could lead to severe consequences.\n","785:  limited resources STEP 2B: METHODS AND ACTIONS We suggest the following list of activities to estimate current and past experiences with weather-related events to help identify future impacts of a changing climate: 1.\n","786:  Identify the changes in climatic variables estimated by climate model

rise etc.)\n","788:  Assess the potential consequences of estimated impacts that could be relevant in designing future development activities, adaptation and mitigation measures 4.\n","789:  Identify areas of future vulnerability in the context of relevant plans, policies and regulations The important part of a climate change impact assessment should be not only obtaining information about changes in basic climatic variables such as temperature and precipitation, but also information on what these changes mean for the resources, infrastructure and vulnerability of areas relevant for the local government.\n","790:  From the adaptation and vulnerability reduction point of view, these consequences arevery important for the design of actual adaptation actions because they relate changes in climate variables to socioeconomic and ecological dimensions of local development.\n","791:  After completing steps 2A and B, the major vulnerabilities to climate change should be identified.\n","792:  This could be done in a meeting or workshop in which the climate impacts and their consequences are presented.\n","793:  Based on the current vulnerabilities and capacities, major future vulnerabilities can be identified.\n","794:  To discuss the current and future vulnerabilities, a method such as _what-if _ analyses could be used (see the Appendix 1 for more details).\n","795:  By

Change in the Okanagan Basin, British Columbia CASE STUDY 5 Focus and objectives of the adaptation initiative: The goal of this initiative was to develop integrated climate change and water resource scenarios for the Okanagan Basin and engage stakeholders in dialogue on the implications of climate change for water management in the region.\n","797:  Current vulnerabilities and capacities: The Okanagan Basin is characterized by a semi-arid climate and rural agrarian landscape and is a significant producer of tree fruits, wine grapes and other horticultural products.\n","798:  The region has also experienced rapid population growth and urbanization in the past two decades, with populations increasing from 210,000 in 1986 to 310,000 in 2001.\n","799:  Population growth is expected to continue, reaching 450,000 by 2031.\n","800:  Long-term climate records in the region indicated a significant warming trend, particularly in winter and spring, leading to earlier onset of spring snowmelt.\n","801:  Increased precipitation has also been observed in spring and summer, along with a reduction in the proportion of precipitation falling as snow at lower elevations.\n","802:  Low snow pack and hot dry summers led to drought conditions in 2002- 2003, causing forest fires and impacts on water supplies in many parts of the basin affecting the ability to meet agricultural, residential and ecological water demands.\n","803:  Estimated potential impacts of a changing climate: Climate and hydrological modeling indicates that the region can expect earlier onset of spring snowmelt, a tendency toward a more rainfall driven hydrological regime, and reductions in annual and spring flow volumes in the 2050s and 2080s.\n","804:  Inflow to Okanagan Lake is estimated to decline to approximately 69% of historical inflows by 2100.\n","805:  Agricultural water demand is expected to rise by 12-20% in the 2020s, 24-38% in the 2050s, and 40-61% in the 2080s over the baseline modeled crop water demand of 200 million m3.\n","806:  Residential water demand is also expected to rise as a function of population growth, housing density and climate change.\n","807:  Long-term goals and principles: Sustainable development is a major concern in the Okanagan Basin.\n","808:  In particular, there is a desire to maintain the rural agrarian landscape, while coping with increasing population growth and density.\n","809:  In this context, there is also a widely recognized need to address impacts of climate change on water supply and demand.\n","811:  Responses to climate change and their implementation: The issue of climate change impacts on water supply and demand has gained a profile in the region over the past several years.\n","812:  As a direct result of this research, climate change projections were incorporated into a sub-regional water management plan and the topic has become has become a major part of sustainable development dialogue processes.\n","813:  A provincially-funded basin-wide water supply and demand study is underway to more accurately characterize current and future water supply and demand and support planning and management decisions.\n","814:  The Okanagan Basin Water Board has also been given greater powers to examine basin-wide water supply and demand issues, explore water, energy and resource conservation issues to promote sustainability in the fast growing region.\n","815:  Source: Cohen et al.\n","816:  (2004); Cohen and Neale (2006) 36 CANADIAN COMMUNITIES_ GUIDEBOOK FOR ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE

decades?\n","818:  3A: Identifying goals and principles of local sustainability This section is focused on examining future development priorities that are articulated in local planning documents such as Official Community Plans (in British Columbia) and sustainable development plans.\n","819:  Local plans developed under the guidance of these documents provide an opportunity to reflect on local priorities in the context of current planning goals, principles and the expected impacts of climate change.\n","820:  STEP 3A: METHODS AND ACTIONS This step will provide an umbrella for identifying actions to respond to climate change in the SAM project to meet overall long-term priorities and help build a resilient community for the future.\n","821:  The step requires creating a vision of the future.\n","822:  Local planning documents very often provide key directions and trajectories for a desired local development path, but often remain very generic and leave space for diverse actions to be included to achieve the goals.\n","823:  In Case Study 6, the desired local development goals were diversifying the local economy by extending tourist activities throughout the whole year.\n","825:  Based on community development priorities, identify the particular short and long-term priorities relevant for the focus of the SAM project 2.\n","826:  Assess how these priorities help to build a resilient community 3.\n","827:  Identify what planning and design challenges have been created as a result of these priorities 4.\n","828:  Assess the challenges created by the future impacts of climate change on the attainment of these goals We suggest collecting the relevant planning documents and convening a meeting or facilitated workshop to discuss the long-term development priorities and what they mean for the focus and the objectives of the SAM project.\n","829:  If such documents are not available, then the community could engage in creating a long-term local development scenario(s).\n","830:  At this step, the future sustainable development priorities in the context of current trends and future climate impacts for the SAM project should be selected.\n","831:  This will help to frame the selection of adaptation and mitigation options discussed in the next step.\n","832:  CANADIAN COMMUNITIES_ GUIDEBOOK FOR ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE 37 guidebook

total amounts we drive.\n","834:  This can only be accomplished by more efficient land use and the development of compact, complete communities.\n","835:  _Smart growth_ is a collection of land use and development principles that aim to enhance our quality of life, preserve the natural environment, and save tax resources over time.\n","837:  Mix land uses so that living, working, and shopping occur in close proximity.\n","838:  Build compact neighbourhoods and communities by identifying growth areas.\n","839:  Provide a variety of transportation choices as alternatives to driving.\n","840:  Create diverse affordable housing opportunities so that residents from all family types, life stages, and income levels can live in the same neighbourhood.\n","841:  Encourage investments in infrastructure and servicing such that new developments do not take up new land.\n","842:  Preserve open spaces, wetlands, grasslands, and other environmentally sensitive areas.\n","843:  Protect and enhance agricultural lands.\n","844:  Utilize green infrastructure, alternative development standards, and green buildings.\n","845:  Foster a unique neighbourhood identity.\n","846:  Nurture engaged citizens.\n","847:  Creating smart growth communities means planning for the long term.\n","849:  Currently, the planning process in BC requires that landscape hazards be identified and the location of a community_s future development considers these hazards.\n","850:  Flooding, sea level rise, avalanche risk, and other climate change scenarios could (and should) be incorporated into this planning process to ensure that future development occurs in the safest places possible.\n","851:  Recently, the Government of British Columbia introduced new strategies and legislation that support the principles of smart growth and will encourage local and regional governments to grow smarter.\n","853:  Once Bill 27 comes into force, local governments will be required to include GHG emission targets, policies and actions in their Official Community Plans and Regional Growth Strategies and will be able to use regulatory tools to promote energy and water conservation, and to waive or reduce charges for green development.\n","854:  The research on urban form and climate change impacts and adaptation may be only beginning to emerge, but the links are already clear.\n","856:  They are

the community more resilient to climate change.\n","861:  Current vulnerability and capacities: Current vulnerability and capacities: Investments have been made into several _off-season_ activities, most notably to the thriving mountain biking industry.\n","862:  This activity ideally complements the ski season: it operates when conditions do not support skiing (during the spring, summer, fall, and even warm winter spells), and much of the same infrastructure (such as ski lifts) can facilitate both sports.\n","864:  Whistler_s investments have resulted in steadily increasing room revenue over the past several summers.\n","865:  Long-term goals and principles: The municipality has also developed a comprehensive sustainability plan, entitled Whistler 2020.\n","866:  One of the goals of the plan is to ensure ongoing economic viability through a continued focus on diversification and other activities.\n","868:  Developers of the plan have identified several measurable indicators of economic viability, and monitor these indicators regularly.\n","869:  Outputs from Whistler 2020 monitoring allows residents and town planners to verify that economic adaptations are actually improving the resilience of the municipality to climate change.\n","870:  Responses to climate change and their implementation: However, Whistler 2020 is a strategic adaptation that complements the economic adaptations previously pursued.\n","871:  The monitoring of economic indicators, as determined by the plan, could help ensure that present and future economic decisions shape a robust and sustainable economy as Whistler encounters climate change.\n","872:  Recent activities to reduce GHG emissions are being introduced including waste recycling, energy efficiency, conservation, increased use of renewable energy and offsetting carbon emissions.\n","873:  It is important to note that Whistler has a distinct advantage over other resort municipalities and tourism businesses because of its status as a well-established, corporately-owned facility with a big budget and substantial political leverage.\n","874:  Source: RMOW (2006); RMOW (2007) CANADIAN COMMUNITIES_ GUIDEBOOK

development goals, the aim of the SAM project becomes one of avoiding _dangerous_ local situations by identifying adaptation options and assessing them in order to determine which are most viable.\n","878:  Mitigation measures can increase local vulnerability to climate change, and measures for adaptation can increase local emissions of GHGs _ unless they are discussed together.\n","879:  This could be achieved for example by conservation measures and producing renewable energy.\n","881:  Estimate impacts of climate change and vulnerabilities of the local system that require adaptation.\n","882:  What kind of expected impacts do we need to adapt to?\n","883:  Identify measures that could provide adaptation to estimated impacts of climate change in the

Responses to climate change and their implementation: In light of these projections, the Toronto Public Health partnered with the Toronto Atmospheric Fund to develop a Heat Health Alert System.\n","976:  When forecasts predict that the threshold of certain pre-determined high-risk climate criteria will be breached, the alert system is triggered.\n","977:  Warnings are advertised on

scale2.\n","1119:  Brainstorming Brainstorming is a popular technique used to generate ideas in a group.\n","1121:  Accordingly, unusual ideas are welcome, and there is an emphasis on building on and extending proposed ideas to come up with ever more creative possibilities (e.g.\n","1122:  see What-if analyses) The Pacific Northwest region in the United States faces critical challenges to a mainly hydroelectric energy supply as summer river flows decrease.\n","1123:  In response to this problem, the University of Washington_s Climate Impacts Group brought together utilities, government agencies and regional planning bodies for brainstorming sessions to develop ideas about possible ways to mitigate projected power shortages for the region (Harden and Eilperin 2006).\n","1124:  Case study The case study is an approach to investigate complex social phenomena within a real-life context, and can be used to explore, describe or explain an observed situation.\n","1125:  The use of case studies is commonly to answer _how_ or _why_ questions about contemporary events where an understanding of how the context relates to observed outcomes is desired (Yin 2004).\n","1126:  For example, case studies exploring the experiences of other local governments with designing and implementing climate change adaptation strategies could provide valuable insight into opportunities and constraints for your context.\n","1127:  This strategy can provide insight into how a real-life system may react to climate change impacts or variability and to adaptation policies.\n","1128:  Case studies are often included as part of developing novel policy areas that an organization may have limited experience with.\n","1129:  A current project by the Canadian Institute of Planners and Natural Resources Canada is using a set of local case studies to find better ways of integrating scientific information into the policy and planning process, and to suggest best practices for use in climate change adaptation planning by municipalities in Canada (Canadian Institute of Planners 2008).\n","1130:  Assessment of the cost of adaptation For our purposes, the cost of adaptation refers to the cost of planned policy initiatives designed to respond to climate change impacts, and does not include unplanned or individual adaptive actions.\n","1131:  A combination of other methods discussed in this document can contribute to this assessment of the cost of adaptation to climate change, and this assessment begins by considering three questions: Adapt to what?\n","1132:  Who or what adapts?\n","1133:  And, how does adaptation occur?\n","1134:  (Smit et al.\n","1135:  To answer the first question one needs to have an idea of how conditions will change _ for example, scenarios or storylines are needed to frame further analysis.\n","1136:  In terms of who or what adapts, the system of interest needs to be defined.\n","1138:  A particular sector or type of infrastructure?\n","1139:  Finally, costs of adaptation depend critically on the strategies chosen and the net costs or benefits of those measures.\n","1140:  These should be considered alongside the net costs or benefits of projected climate change impacts, and the degree to which adaptation measures will provide adequate responses to those impacts (see Assessments of the cost of inaction).\n","1141:

Determining the costs of adaptation is thus a complex task, and methods for this are still developing.\n","1147:  For the most part these methods draw heavily on economic valuation methods (e.g.\n","1148:  : see Cost-benefit analyses and Cost-effectiveness analyses); however, other tools can also be used.\n","1149:  A recent study of climate change adaptation options for water resources in the Okanagan also provided estimates of the cost of various adaptation measures (Cohen and Neale, 2006).\n","1151:  The cost of inaction refers to the net costs that would be incurred due to climate change impacts in the absence of proactive adaptation measures.\n","1152:  This is an important part of understanding and communicating with the public about the potential costs of maintaining the status quo: inaction is not neutral, rather it implies costs that will be borne sometime in the future (e.g.\n","1153:  see Role of discounting).\n","1154:  Estimating the cost of inaction requires an understanding of the current situation and drivers, projecting changes in socioeconomic and climatic systems, interpreting those changes into expected impacts and then estimating economic values for those impacts.\n","1156:  A recent technical report by the European Environmental Agency provides an overview of the methodologies for cost of adaptation and cost of inaction, together with examples of estimates (European Environmental Agency, 2007).\n","1157:  Cost-benefit analyses CBA is a quantitative approach that can be applied to determine the costs and benefits of a course of action in monetary terms.\n","1158:  Three objectives may be evaluated: whether benefits outweigh the costs, whether net benefits are maximized, and which of multiple options presents the most net benefits.\n","1159:  This is one of the more straightforward methods conceptually (although it is data-intensive) and is most appropriate for evaluating economic objectives or objectives that can be meaningfully assessed in monetary terms.\n","1160:  For assets that are not traded through the market (and hence have no dollar value), techniques have been developed for assigning monetary values in some cases, for example by asking what people would be willing to pay for that asset (Rothman et al.\n","1161:  Nonetheless, one of the significant drawbacks of CBA is that its application is problematic when non-monetary values such as social and environmental objectives are also being evaluated, as in climate change studies.\n","1163:  CBA is one of the most widely applied decision support tools.\n","1164:  The state of Maine in the United States used CBA to evaluate four potential options for adapting to sea-level rise at a specific study site, concluding in that case that it would be more cost-effective to retreat from the shoreline as sea level rises, as opposed to protecting development and maintaining the shoreline (USEPA 1995).\n","1165:  Cost-effectiveness analyses This method is used to evaluate a single chosen objective so as to minimize the possible costs associated with its implementation.\n","1166:  In contrast with CBA, this analysis treats benefits as fixed, and seeks only to find the least-cost strategy to achieve an objective.\n","1167:  This method aims to provide a ranking of the cost of different options for achieving the given objective, and is most appropriate for evaluation of isolated projects.\n","1168:  Similar to CBA, this method is limited when non- market values need to be accounted for (see Cost-benefit analyses).\n","1169:  In climate change studies it is suggested that this technique be used where a minimum level of a public good or service is required and the question is therefore how to achieve this objective at a minimal cost.\n","1170:  Flood protection could be an example of such a service.\n","1171:  In the United Kingdom, a cost- effectiveness analysis methodology was developed for determining whether options for achieving established water service standards could be carried out at a reasonable cost (Risk and Policy Analysts Ltd. 2004).\n","1172:  Decision analysis Decision Analysis is a formalized method for approaching decision-making that employs a wide range of tools to structure and evaluate choices to see how well options satisfy 64 CANADIAN COMMUNITIES_ GUIDEBOOK FOR ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE guidebook livia-rev-final:Layout 1 12/23/08 9:25 AM Page 65 APPENDIX 1 objectives.\n","1173:  This type of analysis begins with generating a comprehensive list of options that could potentially address the defined problem.\n","1174:  Influence diagrams or decision trees are then used to identify points where decisions would have to be made, and where chance occurrences would influence the direction of events.\n","1175:  The likelihood of chance events is then evaluated, and the utility of different outcomes is calculated.\n","1176:  A final step uses specific criteria to determine which set of options has the greatest potential to achieve desired outcomes.\n","1177:  Decision analysis has been applied to evaluate intersecting issues of adaptation, mitigation and sustainable development in the context of BC_s Gateway Programme.\n","1178:  The method allows a complex and contentious set of issues and objectives to be structured in a way that can enhance understanding and communication to aid in the decision-making process (Wilson and McDaniels, 2007).\n","1179:  Role of discounting in assessments Discounting is a method used in economic analyses to compare the value of costs and benefits occurring at different points in time.\n","1180:  To calculate the value today, of something that will exist in the future, a _discount rate_ is used.\n","1181:  A discount rate expresses the degree to which consumption today is preferred over consumption a year from now_the higher the discount rate, the less value that is placed on that consumption (or good, service, cost, benefit, etc) in the future.\n","1182:  Discounting is an important consideration because of our tendency to value a cost or benefit in the present more than that same cost or benefit in the future.\n","1183:  However, application in the context of climate change and sustainable development also begs consideration of preserving options for future generations, which would imply quite a low discount rate.\n","1184:  A recent and controversial application of discounting was the United Kingdom_s _Stern Review_ that was charged with evaluating the cost of climate change adaptation in comparison to the cost of inaction, globally.\n","1185:  Considerable debate developed around the report_s conclusions, in part due to differing perspectives on whether the appropriate _social rate of time_ discount rate had been applied.\n","1186:  This type of discount compares the value of well-being today to well-being of future generations.\n","1187:  Stern chose to use a very low discount rate that values well-being in the future as virtually equal to well-being today.\n","1188:  While some defend this choice based on the imperatives of sustainable development, it is ultimately an ethical choice, not a technical choice.\n","1189:  Hence, others begin from different ethical assumptions and conclude that a higher discount rate would produce more appropriate results (Varian, 2006).\n","1190:  Downscaling techniques Downscaling is the process of deriving local or regional scale climate information from models or data at a larger scale.\n","1191:  In effect, the larger climate is used as a predictor of the local climate.\n","1193:  Dynamical downscaling uses the inputs of Global Climate Models (GCMs) in order to develop Regional Climate Models (RCMs).\n","1194:  Statistical downscaling combines large-scale climate variables with locally observed variables (often from a specific weather station) to produce a statistical model that is then used to project future changes at a local scale.\n","1195:  An advantage of statistical downscaling is that it is less computationally demanding than dynamical downscaling, although it still requires a large amount of data to develop the model (Barrow et al, 2004; CCSN, 2007).\n","1197:  The Canadian Climate Change Scenarios Network provides further information and software tools on their website (http://www.cccsn.ca).\n","1198:  This method is increasingly being applied in order to develop smaller-scale scenarios that can aid in developing climate change adaptation policies at a local or regional scale.\n","1200:  The judgments can be of at least two types, and are commonly a bit of both: that is, they may be issues of factual judgment (something that can be proven right or wrong) or of value judgment (expressing an opinion) that derives from expert knowledge of the issue being evaluated.\n","1201:  This is a routine part of creating policy-relevant evaluations.\n","1202:  Often expert judgment is done informally, although it is increasingly a formalized component of studies on climate change and associated uncertainty analyses.\n","1203:  Two main ways CANADIAN COMMUNITIES_ GUIDEBOOK FOR ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE 65 guidebook livia-rev-final:Layout 1 12/23/08 9:25 AM Page 66 APPENDIX 1 that expert judgment can be applied formally are by pooling expert judgments to achieve one combined result or by presenting a range of distinct judgments made by individual experts.\n","1204:  In the latter case a further process, such as consensus building, will be needed in order to incorporate these judgments into societally acceptable decisions.\n","1205:  A related approach is the Delphi technique, where expert judgments are contributed in a structured process to come up with joint forecasts (Willows and Connell, 2003).\n","1206:  Expert judgment is used often in climate change studies where there is a lack of available data or where uncertainty is so great that other quantitative evaluations will not produce a meaningful result.\n","1207:  For example, where predictions of technological, social or political change are required for climate change scenario development, formalized expert judgment may be the most reasonable way of estimating the necessary parameters.\n","1208:  Another common use of expert judgment in climate change studies is to estimate uncertainty (Otwayl et al., 1992; Webster et al., 2003).\n","1209:  Facilitated workshops Facilitated workshops are a participatory method that incorporates the ideas, concerns and preferences of all participants in a structured decision-making process.\n","1210:  The technique draws on Decision analysis methods and requires participants to apply information to develop ideas and provide judgments on options.\n","1211:  This often results in a ranking of policy options.\n","1212:  It contributes to a learning process individually and collectively that simultaneously incorporates diverse beliefs and values to develop joint recommendations on preferred actions.\n","1213:  A series of facilitated workshops were used recently in the Okanagan as part of a participatory integrated assessment of water management.\n","1214:  This method was used in order to enhance learning and understanding of the issue among participants, and to jointly develop a decision support model that is used to increase knowledge about the system and explore plausible future scenarios and adaptation options (Cohen and Neale, 2006).\n","1216:  This group is guided by a facilitator through an interactive discussion around specific questions in order to learn from participants_ experience.\n","1217:  The method is distinguished from other group methods by its intentional interaction between participants that can provide shared insight and a diversity of understandings, and can be an efficient way of gathering responses with limited resources or time.\n","1218:  However, the very strength of this method_ interaction_means that special consideration needs to be taken where sensitive topics are being discussed, or power dynamics between participants could constrain individual responses (Morgan, 1996).\n","1219:  Focus groups are used in a variety of settings for a range of purposes.\n","1220:  For example, this technique is currently being used by Natural Resources Canada and professional planning associations in development of a national planning policy on climate change adaptation.\n","1221:  Elsewhere, focus groups have been used in the prairies to understand agricultural producers_ perceptions of risks, opportunities and capabilities due to climate change, as well as their ideas of what support will be required to manage risk (Stroh Consulting, 2005).\n","1222:  Multi-criteria analyses Multi-Criteria Analysis (MCA) refers to any structured Decision analysis that evaluates preferred options for addressing a number of objectives simultaneously.\n","1223:  This is done by identifying desired objectives and corresponding indicators that can include social, economic, biophysical or other types of components.\n","1224:  These indicators are often evaluated quantitatively, for example through ranking or economic valuation; however, they will often not be in the same units and may also include qualitative measures.\n","1225:  MCA includes techniques for comparing and evaluating outcomes while incorporating this range of types of indicators, and is particularly useful where a method such as cost-benefit analysis cannot be used due to the difficulties in assigning monetary values to social or environmental objectives.\n","1226:  This approach has wide application.\n","1227:  In Canada, it has been used to evaluate conflictual policy areas such as sustainable forestry options in B.C.\n","1228:  that address a range of public objectives (Sheppard and Meitner, 2005), and evaluating alternative energy supply futures for the country (Noble, 2004).\n","1229:  66 CANADIAN COMMUNITIES_ GUIDEBOOK FOR ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE guidebook livia-rev-final:Layout 1 12/23/08 9:25 AM Page 67 APPENDIX 1 Policy exercise This method brings together policy makers with academics to combine knowledge from multiple disciplines for use in developing policy to deal with complex management issues.\n","1231:  This method requires a significant investment of time and capacity and incorporates a combination of mathematical or computer-based modeling and scenario analysis together with techniques such as facilitated workshops and brainstorming.\n","1232:  The exercise is conducted in an organizational context that reflects real-world institutional issues of relevance to the problem being discussed.\n","1233:  This method can be used both to generate and evaluate adaptation options.\n","1234:  The process does not necessarily result in new knowledge or an explicit set of policy recommendations.\n","1235:  Rather, it can be used to identify priorities and gaps in knowledge, as well as institutional barriers or needed technological changes.\n","1236:  In a case applying the policy exercise (PE) approach in southeast Asia, a combination of methods including data collection, modeling, impact assessments and background scenarios were used in preparation for the policy exercise workshops.\n","1237:  This experience demonstrated the usefulness of PE for effectively structuring the issues involved in order to develop appropriate adaptation policy options (McCarthy et al., 2001).\n","1238:  Scenario development and analyses Synthetic and analogue scenarios, in addition to Global Climate Model (GCM) scenarios, are methods for exploring possible changes in future climates (See Barrow et al., 2004, Section 6.4).\n","1240:  This is done by using historical climate records and altering a climate variable by an arbitrary amount to see how it affects the system.\n","1241:  Accordingly, its main use is in sensitivity analysis, to gain a better understanding of how changes to a certain variable may impact a system.\n","1242:  It can also be used to identify thresholds and the tolerance of the system to changes in climate.\n","1243:  Analogue scenarios use existing climate information, either from the site being studied (_temporal_ analogue) or from another location whose current climate is similar to that expected for the study site in the future (_spatial_ analogue).\n","1244:  A strength of temporal analogues is that, because the climate was experienced in the past, it is physically plausible that it could occur in the future.\n","1245:  While the same is partly true for spatial analogues, the transferability of climate data from one location to another is limited due to geographical differences between locations (e.g: day length, proximity to water, etc).\n","1246:  For both types of scenarios, a key limitation is that using analogues as a basis for future scenarios assumes that the climate will continue to respond the same way in the future as it has in the past.\n","1248:  The other side of scenario development concerns the socioeconomic context and drivers for climate impact assessment.\n","1249:  This may be done by developing plausible _storylines_ that describe social, economic, technological and political changes that will have a bearing on emissions, future conditions and adaptation possibilities.\n","1250:  As it is impossible to predict trajectories for socioeconomic scenarios, these are often expressed as possible alternative futures.\n","1251:  For the United Kingdom Climate Impacts Programme, four socioeconomic scenarios were developed alongside climate scenarios in order to produce an integrated climate impact assessment.\n","1252:  Socioeconomic scenario development is also useful for promoting social learning about climate change impacts in the community (Berkhout et al., 2002).\n","1253:  Scenario analysis is a systematic evaluation using expert judgment and scientific methods to identify a range of possible outcomes that could occur, taking into account key drivers and the uncertainty surrounding them.\n","1254:  This is the method used in the IPCC reports to develop future climate scenarios.\n","1255:  In California, scenario analysis was used to explore possible energy futures, identify potential challenges and strategies, and make policy recommendations for the state (Ghanadan and Koomey, 2005).\n","1256:  Sensitivity analyses Sensitivity analysis is a technique that looks at how sensitive a system is to climate variability or change.\n","1257:  For example, how does the system respond to an increase of 2_C in average surface temperature?\n","1259:  Sensitivity analysis can also be used in estimating the uncertainty of outcomes (see Uncertainty analyses).\n","1260:  CANADIAN COMMUNITIES_ GUIDEBOOK FOR ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE 67 guidebook livia-rev-final:Layout 1 12/23/08 9:25 AM Page 68 APPENDIX 1 Sensitivity analysis was applied in a Canadian study to evaluate the impacts of climate change on drainage design methods and on different types of drainage systems.\n","1261:  Using this method, they were able to investigate possible changes to variables, such as peak flow and runoff volume and how these changes would affect components of the drainage system, including required pipe size or the cost of different design methods (Kije Sipi Ltd., 2001).\n","1262:  Trade-off analyses Trade-off analysis is a form of integrated assessment that incorporates stakeholders, experts and policy makers in a process designed to provide policy-relevant information.\n","1263:  Through incorporation of relevant components of the social, economic, decision-making and biophysical systems, this approach highlights the interactions between different components of the system in order to describe tradeoffs associated with different adaptation options.\n","1264:  Various qualitative and/or quantitative methods may be employed in the research process, including public consultations, focus groups, expert judgment, and mathematical models.\n","1265:  Tradeoffs are identified between the components of interest.\n","1266:  For example, these could be tradeoffs between different sectors of society, between environmental, social and economic objectives, or between adaptation and mitigation policies.\n","1267:  These tradeoffs are then presented publicly in various forms, for example as tradeoff curves, maps or risk diagrams, to be used in decision-making (Stoorvogel et al., 2004).\n","1268:  This approach was applied in a case in the Philippines to evaluate tradeoffs in climate change adaptation options for a specific watershed.\n","1269:  This study examined tradeoffs between key sectors of society in order to identify potential synergies and conflicts between different adaptation options.\n","1270:  This provided insights into which policy options may have positive impacts on multiple sectors and which may have negative consequences.\n","1271:  Thus allowing policy to be directed towards optimizing synergies and proactively mitigating negative effects of adaptation strategies.\n","1272:  This approach also helped to identify early on some of the potential conflicts that could arise (Lasco et al., 2006).\n","1273:  Uncertainty analyses Two main sources of uncertainty for climate change policy derive from limitations on our knowledge of how the global climate system works and our ability to model it, and the uncertainties present in predicting the course of human actions in the future (e.g.\n","1274:  policy decisions, demographics, economics, technology, etc).\n","1275:  While efforts are constantly being made to reduce uncertainties around climate change science and modeling, uncertainty will always be an important component informing climate change policy.\n","1276:  Rather than becoming a source of indecision, this must be recognized and analyzed so as to best understand and communicate the areas of uncertainty that have a bearing on policy decisions.\n","1277:  Uncertainty analysis is therefore an integral part of any climate change assessment.\n","1278:  This analysis can also be used to describe different types and degrees of uncertainty relating to policy options, or to assign relative likelihoods to various scenarios and present a selection of most likely scenarios.\n","1279:  The purpose is to provide an informed basis for decision-makers and the public to begin consideration of appropriate policy options for adaptation and mitigation (Webster, 2003).\n","1280:  For example, in the IPCC Fourth Assessment report uncertainty analysis is used to provide judgments of relative likelihoods that projected outcomes will occur, expressed in terms of the following confidence levels: (cid:129) Very High confidence (at least 9 out of 10 chance of being correct) (cid:129) High confidence (about 8 out of 10 chance) (cid:129) Medium confidence (about 5 out of 10 chance) (cid:129) Low confidence (about 2 out of 10 chance) (cid:129) Very low confidence (less than 1 out of 10 chance) Vulnerability assessment A starting point for planning for climate change adaptation is to conduct an assessment of the vulnerability of a community_s human, natural and physical infrastructure to climate variability and severe weather.\n","1281:  Such an understanding provides a basis for setting adaptation policy priorities by identifying areas that require new policies or partnerships, and areas of emerging opportunities.\n","1282:  Vulnerability assessment at a local level proceeds in five steps.\n","1283:  First, parties that would be affected by, and make decisions about, climate change for a certain sector are brought together.\n","1284:  Second, current vulnerabilities to severe weather events are identified by participants for all affected sectors.\n","1285:  Third, future conditions 68 CANADIAN COMMUNITIES_ GUIDEBOOK FOR ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE guidebook livia-rev-final:Layout 1 12/23/08 9:25 AM Page 69 APPENDIX 1 are estimated.\n","1286:  Scenarios developed by experts on projected socio-economic and climate changes are provided to participants who consider what economic, social and environmental impacts may occur as a result.\n","1287:  In step four, future vulnerabilities are estimated based on these scenarios, and potential adaptation strategies are identified.\n","1288:  The final step is to evaluate options and their potential to reduce vulnerability, decide on preferred strategies and implement them.\n","1289:  Implementation requires ongoing monitoring and review to ensure that adaptation approaches are responding to actual conditions and new information as it becomes available (Lemmen and Warren, 2004).\n","1290:  Vulnerability assessment has been utilized in BC to evaluate the vulnerability of forestry-based communities to climate change in places like Vanderhoof, BC (Natural Resources Canada, 2005).\n","1291:  What-if analyses There are a variety of types of this analysis, which begins with the postulating of _What if?_ questions in a structured brainstorming session.\n","1292:  This is commonly used in risk management to anticipate potential problems and suggest response strategies and ways of mitigating the risk.\n","1293:  In climate change studies, this technique can be used to initiate discussion about what impacts may occur under certain changes in climate, and generate ideas of appropriate responses.\n","1295:  and What changes in water policy would be required for various uses, given this condition?_ This technique could be used in a focus group or workshop setting that gathers together experts on the general subject area (e.g.\n","1296:  agricultural or engineering experts) or the specific area of application (e.g.\n","1297:  planners and engineers at the city).\n","1298:  CANADIAN COMMUNITIES_ GUIDEBOOK FOR ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE 69 guidebook livia-rev-final:Layout 1 12/23/08 9:25 AM Page 70 APPENDIX 2 appendix 2: understanding the consequences of climate change impacts The important part of a climate change impact assessment should be not only obtaining information about changes in basic climatic variables such as temperature and precipitation, but also information on what these changes mean for the resources, infrastructure and vulnerability of areas relevant for the local government.\n","1299:  This section outlines potential consequences of impacts that changes in climate variables could pose on the community.\n","1300:  From the viewpoint of adaptation and vulnerability reduction, these consequences are very important for the design of adaptation actions since they relate changes in climate variables to socio-economic and ecological dimensions of local development.\n","1301:  The list below helps to illuminate potential local consequences that are caused by the impacts of a changing climate and what potential vulnerability these consequences lead to at the local level.\n","1302:  If the impacts are changes in temperature, runoff and other climatic conditions; these will lead to significant changes in species ranges, ecosystem structure and function The consequences could be issues such as: (cid:129) Changes in climatic conditions will cause shifts in the geographic ranges of species.\n","1303:  This is generally expected as a shift of species northward accompanied by a fundamental restructuring of ecosystems as conditions change.\n","1304:  (cid:129) The shift in habitable areas for species is expected to have serious consequences for overall biodiversity, given the natural (water bodies, mountains, etc.)\n","1305:  and human (habitat fragmentation) barriers to species migration.\n","1306:  Increased competition for available water supplies with human uses during the summer or periods of drought will additionally stress ecosystems.\n","1307:  These consequences could lead to potential vulnerability at the local level as follows: (cid:129) Shifting ranges of species and a fundamental rearrangement of ecosystems in North America Species ranges typically shifting northward and to higher elevations.\n","1308:  Such changes in ecosystem composition can facilitate other disturbances, including invasive species or other infestations Significant number of species extinctions are expected (cid:129) (cid:129) Effects on phenology, migration, reproduction and dormancy of animals across (cid:129) (cid:129) (cid:129) North America Surface and bottom water temperatures of lakes, reservoirs, rivers and estuaries in North America will likely increase (projection of 2 to 7_C under doubling of CO2) Increased vegetation growth in certain areas, and an earlier onset of spring _greenness_ (cid:129) Forest growth will likely improve slightly in North America (cid:129) Increased river scouring and turbulence due to changes in runoff timing could have negative effects on aquatic ecosystems 70 CANADIAN COMMUNITIES_ GUIDEBOOK FOR ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE guidebook livia-rev-final:Layout 1 12/23/08 9:25 AM Page 71 APPENDIX 2 If the impacts are sea level rise, changing ocean temperatures, extreme weather events; these will have impacts on intertidal and marine ecosystems The consequences could be issues such as: (cid:129) When sea level rises at a moderate pace, intertidal ecosystems will naturally migrate inland.\n","1309:  In the local context, however, flood protection and coastal development pose a barrier to this natural migratory process that will limit the ability of these ecosystems to adapt to changing sea level.\n","1310:  Expected increases in extreme weather and storm surges will add to the stress on these ecosystems.\n","1311:  Increased ocean temperatures can also have serious implications for local ocean productivity, including phenomena such as red tides.\n","1312:  Changes to ocean productivity and ecosystem function will have cascade effects on dependent species such as sea birds that depend on this food supply.\n","1313:  Additionally, invasive species may fundamentally change coastal ecosystems.\n","1314:  (cid:129) These consequences could lead to potential vulnerability at the local level as follows: (cid:129) Rates of coastal wetland loss will increase due to sea level rise (high confidence); salt marshes may mitigate this effect or they themselves may decrease, depending on rate of sea level rise and storm impacts (cid:129) Existing dykes may prevent the natural migration of intertidal ecosystems as (cid:129) Dikes and other mitigation/adaptation measures could have negative effects on (cid:129) Extreme weather will additionally stress ecological integrity in coastal areas (cid:129) Warming is likely to extend and intensify summer thermal stratification, contributing to oxygen depletion (cid:129) Estuarine communities and littoral biological productivity will change as sea sea level rises ecosystems level rises (cid:129) Potentially negative impacts on ocean biodiversity and productivity, and resulting impacts for sea birds due to a decrease in food supply (cid:129) Coastal habitats and dependent species will be increasingly threatened If the impacts are changes to water quantity, temperature and salinity, this will stress fish, fisheries and the food chain The consequences could be issues such as: (cid:129) Climate change will contribute to profound changes in salmon health, migration patterns and spawning success.\n","1315:  (cid:129) Declines in salmon populations have cascading effects for terrestrial species and ecosystems that depend fundamentally on the salmon as a food and nutrient source.\n","1316:  Changes in water temperatures and river flows will create opportunities for exotic species to invade.\n","1317:  These consequences could lead to potential vulnerability at the local level as follows: (cid:129) (cid:129) Fisheries will be negatively affected by salinity and temperature changes

livia-rev-final:Layout 1 12/23/08 9:25 AM Page 72 APPENDIX 2 If the impacts are changes to precipitation type, timing, intensity and frequency; together with temperature changes these will impact the availability and quality of the water supply The consequences could be issues such as: (cid:129) Water demand is increasing due to population growth and development.\n","1318:  However, shrinking glaciers, earlier snowmelts and a decreasing snowpack will mean that less water is available in the summer and fall when there is high demand for hydroelectric power and local uses.\n","1319:  Increased demand for surface water will in turn place pressure on limited groundwater supplies that are also at risk of salinization as sea level rises.\n","1320:  As well, increasing water temperature, water-borne diseases, forest fires and landslides are a growing concern and can impact water quality.\n","1321:  These consequences could lead to potential vulnerability at the local level as follows: (cid:129) An increasing proportion of precipitation falls as rain rather than snow (cid:129) Earlier melting and a significantly decreasing snowpack contribute to increases in winter and early spring flows while summer flows may decrease substantially In the short term, melting glaciers may add to streamflow in spring; in the long term, this will probably mean less runoff, especially in summer Increased water stress regionally and greater competition between agricultural, industrial and ecological uses across the continent (cid:129) Ground water levels will rise as sea level rises, adding costs for water pumping (cid:129) (cid:129) and resulting in salt water intrusion into some wells and aquifers (cid:129) More frequent landslides, forest fire contaminants as well as warmer (cid:129) temperatures could impact water quality Surface and bottom water temperatures of lakes, reservoirs, rivers and estuaries in North America will likely increase (projection of 2 to 7_C under doubling of CO2) (cid:129) Water quality impacts could occur due to a longer erosion season and enhanced erosion in agricultural areas If the impacts are changes in amount and timing of precipitation, sea level rise and extreme weather; these will stress water, storm and sewer infrastructure The consequences could be issues such as: (cid:129) The amount and timing of precipitation poses clear challenges for the capacity and functioning of stormwater infrastructure and the sewer system, particularly in urban contexts with low permeability (e.g.\n","1322:  paved surfaces).\n","1323:  At the same time, sea level rise could raise the water table and result in the floating of sewers and foundations if they are not designed to deal with this.\n","1324:  These consequences could lead to potential vulnerability at the local level as follows: (cid:129) Increases in heavy precipitation with expanding impervious surfaces (e.g.\n","1325:  asphalt) could increase urban flood risk and pose design challenges and costs for stormwater management (cid:129) Potential issues with reservoir capacity and operations, water supply, storm and sanitary sewer size, sewer flow during periods of summer drought and sewer outfall as sea level rises (cid:129) There is no urgent need to upgrade infrastructure capacity; however, adding higher capacity by additional actions or upgrading the infrastructure as part of the regular maintenance cycle would be prudent (cid:129) Rise in water table may also cause floating of sewers, foundations, etc that were not designed for those conditions (cid:129) Continual upgrades of water and sewage systems will be necessary, and additional energy may be required for pumping 72 CANADIAN COMMUNITIES_ GUIDEBOOK FOR ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE guidebook livia-rev-final:Layout 1 12/23/08 9:25 AM Page 73 APPENDIX 2 If the impacts are water supply shortages, temperature changes, changes in the number of growing days and in the frequency of natural disturbances; these will have both positive and negative implications for agriculture and food security If the impacts are a reduction in snowfall, this will pose challenges for winter sport industries, while beaches and natural parks will be faced with both challenges and opportunities in a changing climate The consequences could be issues such as: (cid:129) Projected changes in the local climate are generally expected to have positive impacts for agriculture in terms of the number of growing days, length of the growing season and potential to grow higher-value crops.\n","1326:  This will be constrained, however, by soil suitability, moisture and erosion.\n","1328:  These consequences could lead to potential vulnerability at the local level as follows: (cid:129) Vulnerability of agriculture to climate change is complex: it is dependant upon direct and indirect climate effects, economic factors and technological and adaptation changes (cid:129) The increase in number of growing days, decrease in frost-frequency in spring and fall, extension of the frost-free period and trend towards an earlier spring could have a positive impact on the agricultural growing season in Canada.\n","1329:  Moderate climate change will likely increase yields of rain-fed agriculture in North America by 5 to 20% over the first decades of the century (high confidence).\n","1330:  However, potentially positive impacts on agriculture are dependent on appropriate soil types, soil moisture, water availability and erosion.\n","1331:  Potential for more spring flooding as well as summer drought conditions (lower soil moisture and streamflow) (cid:129) Changes in temperature can improve or impair production of different crops; crops currently near thresholds will be negatively impacted (medium confidence) (cid:129) Heavy rainfalls can impact agricultural crops (cid:129) Possible introduction of new agricultural pests and diseases The consequences could be issues such as: (cid:129) As winters become milder and less precipitation falls as snow, winter sport industries, notably the ski industry, will be negatively impacted.\n","1332:  As sea level rises, more severe weather and storm surges become more frequent, beaches and waterfront areas could erode or become submerged.\n","1333:  Warmer weather could attract more tourism for parks and beaches; however, ecosystem impacts of climate change discussed above could threaten these areas.\n","1334:  These consequences could lead to potential vulnerability at the local level as follows: (cid:129) Winter recreation could be negatively impacted, but snowmaking could offset some of the reduction to the ski season (cid:129) Recreational beaches would change and some could become submerged (cid:129) A longer warm weather tourist season could increase visits to Canada_s natural parks, bringing economic benefits, but more pressure on ecological systems CANADIAN COMMUNITIES_

challenge energy production, transportation and associated infrastructure and economic activity The consequences could be issues such as: (cid:129) Changes in water availability could be positive in the winter as supply increases but negative in the summer when a reduced water supply coincides with increases in energy demand for residential cooling and other competing uses.\n","1335:  On the other hand, demand for heating in the winter has decreased in Western Canada.\n","1336:  (cid:129) Transportation and associated infrastructure such as port facilities could be affected in many ways.\n","1337:  Milder winter conditions could improve air and ground travel, but more frequent storms could have the opposite effect.\n","1338:  Sea level rise is of particular importance for communities expanding along their coastlines, as a rising water table may reduce the bearing capacity of roads.\n","1339:  Interruptions to energy and transportation services can have large associated costs for the economy, as witnessed during the 2003 power outage in northeastern North America.\n","1340:  These consequences could lead to potential vulnerability at the local level as follows: (cid:129) Hydropower production is sensitive to total runoff, the timing of runoff, and to reservoir levels (cid:129) Under projected temperature increases, hydroelectric supply will improve in winter, but face challenges in summer due to conflict with instream flow targets and salmon restoration goals (e.g.\n","1341:  under the Endangered Species Act) In western Canada, there has been a significant decrease in the number of days requiring space heating and an increase in the number of days requiring space cooling, with resultant implications on total energy demand (cid:129) (cid:129) Warmer and less snowy winters may reduce delays, improve ground and air transportation reliability and reduce road maintenance demands.\n","1342:  However, more storms could increase risks (cid:129) Declining fog trend in some parts of North America could be good for transportation.\n","1343:  Higher potential flood levels and more frequent flooding at levels rarely experienced today is projected with very high confidence (cid:129) More frequent flooding and landslides would impact transportation (cid:129) Heat spells could cause increasing damage to railroad tracks and roads, with (cid:129) implications for future road design, construction and management Sea level rise and an increase in extreme storm events has implications for ports, airports, railways, roads, highways, and inland

Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation November 14, 2017 1.\n","2057:  INTRODUCTION This report was commissioned by Environment Yukon_s Climate Change Secretariat to provide the public and other stakeholders with an understanding of how climate change is affecting Yukon, what actions have been taken to date to help us adapt, and the key challenges that we_ll need to address to adapt in the future.\n","2058:  This work will also explore the economic challenges and opportunities related to adaptation.\n","2059:  This is not a comprehensive documentation of all the issues around climate change and adaptation efforts.\n","2060:  It is a synthesis of existing knowledge and provides a focused snapshot on selected key adaptation challenges in the Yukon.\n","2061:  1.1 CONTEXT Climate change is already affecting Yukon and consideration of climate is becoming increasingly important in decision making and planning for the future.\n","2062:  The Yukon Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation _State of Play_ report was developed to provide Yukoners with the latest information about climate change impacts and adaptation in Yukon.\n","2063:  Included in the analysis are the economic impacts of climate change.\n","2064:  The report is designed to support public participation in decision making about climate change issues that affect Yukon communities by providing a snapshot of climate change impacts and adaptation efforts to date.\n","2065:  Canada, along with most other countries, has begun taking more aggressive action on climate change.\n","2066:  The recently adopted Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change (2016) commits to action in the areas of climate change mitigation, adaptation, carbon pricing, and clean economic growth.\n","2067:  The Yukon government has committed to renewing its climate change strategy in a manner that better integrates its approaches to energy, climate change risk and action, and clean growth/economic development.\n","2068:  Throughout this process, Yukon government aims to engage with the public to solicit feedback on the renewal of this strategy.\n","2071:  Indeed, _climate change has compounded some of the existing vulnerabilities caused by these other factors_ (Larsen et al., 2014).\n","2072:  Adaptation to climate change starts when governments, communities, and individuals adjust their expectations about the future and make decisions to better prepare for changing conditions.\n","2073:  Yukon has already started to adapt to the effects of climate change and decision makers have taken steps to address present and future climate change impacts through adaptation policies and initiatives.\n","2074:  Despite this, efforts to integrate climate change considerations into decisions and implement effective adaptive actions face significant challenges.\n","2075:  RESEARCH NORTHWEST & MORRISON HERSHFIELD 1 Yukon _State of Play_: Analysis of Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation Our ability to adapt to climate change will have an important influence on what Yukon_s future will look like.\n","2076:  If we are proactive in our approach to adaptation many issues can be avoided and some impacts lessened.\n","2077:  However, some impacts will be much more difficult to adapt to.\n","2078:  Building momentum for climate change adaptation will take time and concerted effort.\n","2079:  Developing expertise and allocating adequate financial resources to adaptation initiatives and planning is critical.\n","2080:  This report was developed in part to help support collaborative opportunities for climate change adaptation where connections are not always clear and simple.\n","2081:  1.2 APPROACH Our approach to this report has been to: November 14, 2017 What is Climate Change Adaptation?\n","2082:  Climate change adaptation refers to actions that reduce the negative impact of climate change and/or take advantage of new opportunities.\n","2083:  It involves making adjustments in our decisions, activities and thinking because of observed or expected changes in climate.\n","2084:  (Lemmen, Warren, Lacroix, and Bush, 2008).\n","2085:  _ Provide a synthesis of the most up to date information available on climate change impacts and adaptation in Yukon (Section 2); _ Select and present concrete examples of some of the Yukon-specific work being done to better understand the effects of local climate change (Section 2.3); _ Provide an overview of our assessment of the Yukon_s capacity to adapt to climate change (Section 3) along with a list of known adaptation initiatives undertaken in the territory (APPENDIX B); and, _ Examine in more detail four issues that are particularly important as the Yukon continues to adapt to the realities of climate change: o Increased risk of extreme weather and wildfire hazards (Section 4); o Damage to infrastructure (Section 5); o Changing ecological landscapes (Section 6); and, o Concerns regarding human health (Section 7).\n","2086:  The four major issues grew from our review of the relevant literature and discussions with key contacts.\n","2087:  For each of the four issues listed above, we summarize how climate change and current adaptation efforts intersect with the issue now and how we expect those intersections to change.\n","2088:  We have attempted to identify further opportunities for adaptation, economic costs and possible economic benefits.\n","2089:  These opportunities are not intended to be exhaustive or definitive, but to provide a starting point for a renewed conversation about how Yukon can address current and future climate change impacts.\n","2090:  RESEARCH NORTHWEST & MORRISON HERSHFIELD 2 Yukon _State of Play_: Analysis of Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation Our focus on further opportunities for adaptation has been guided by four questions: November 14, 2017 _ Are the risks of not taking further adaptation action significant?\n","2092:  _ Will Yukon regret doing this if the climate threat does not materialize?\n","2093:  _ Is this action a win for Yukon communities even if the climate threat turns out to not be a severe as some scenarios projected?\n","2094:  We have also attempted to explicitly highlight where the suggested adaptation opportunities might intersect with other issues and opportunities in Yukon (e.g.\n","2095:  Fire Smart and biomass heat).\n","2097:  Photo 1: Slims River (Environment Yukon) RESEARCH NORTHWEST & MORRISON HERSHFIELD 3 Yukon _State of Play_: Analysis of Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation 2.\n","2098:  YUKON_S CHANGING CLIMATE November 14, 2017 Climate change is a complex problem that impacts natural, human, and cultural systems in many ways.\n","2099:  In Yukon, changes to the climate have already been observed and impact our water, ecosystems, landscapes, and ways of life.\n","2100:  How climate change is understood and talked about in Yukon is grounded in scientific evidence, the Traditional Knowledge of Yukon First Nations, and the observations of Yukoners.\n","2101:  Changes are expected to continue and increase in the decades ahead.\n","2102:  The amount of change and associated impacts will ultimately depend on the success of global efforts to curb emissions of greenhouse gasses (i.e.\n","2103:  mitigate climate change) and our ability to adapt to climate change Gradual and Sudden Although temperature and precipitation seem to be changing slowly, the interaction between _gradual_ changes and other factors can produce complex and sudden effects.\n","2104:  For example, warmer annual temperatures associated with climate change have accelerated the retreat of the Kaskawulsh glacier, which led to a sudden diversion of water from the Slims River to the Alsek River in 2016.\n","2105:  This resulted in a substantial drop in water levels in the Slims River and in Kluane Lake, which impacts the communities of Burwash Landing and Destruction Bay.\n","2106:  Temperature and precipitation are well understood and widely used indicators of climate change that drive a broad range of climate impacts.\n","2107:  The Yukon generally has only about 50 years of temperature and precipitation data, not a significant record given that a climate normal is usually defined over a 30-year period.\n","2108:  This lack of long-term data makes additional proxy data drawn from historical, local, and indigenous sources of knowledge particularly valuable in improving our understanding how climate change is affecting the Yukon.\n","2109:  Variability Within Long-Term Trends Long-term climate trends are important, but these broader changes are driven in part by short-term weather variability.\n","2110:  Extreme swings in temperature and precipitation can have serious impacts on everything from infrastructure to wildlife breeding cycles, but increases in the severity, frequency or duration of extreme events are not easily captured in long-term trends.\n","2111:  For example, a one degree increase in average annual temperature can mean 25 days where temperatures are 15 degrees above the seasonal normal if climate remains at normal levels the rest of the year.\n","2112:  This example shows how averaging change in temperature throughout the year can hide the extent of extreme temperature variability.\n","2113:  RESEARCH NORTHWEST & MORRISON HERSHFIELD This section summarizes analyses of temperature and precipitation data to show how Yukon_s climate has changed and how it is expected to change in the future.\n","2114:  Projections for temperature and precipitation change in Old Crow and Whitehorse are also highlighted as local examples of the type of change Yukoners can expect to see in their communities.\n","2115:  As climate change impacts Yukon_s regions in different ways, this section also includes discussion of how Yukoners are observing the impacts of climate change in their own communities 4 Yukon _State of Play_: Analysis of Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation and in culturally and ecologically important places.\n","2117:  November 14, 2017 2.1 HISTORICAL CHANGES IN TEMPERATURE AND PRECIPITATION The strongest measure of climate change in Yukon is relative change in annual temperature.\n","2118:  The annual average temperature has increased 2_C over the past 50 years, while winter temperatures have increased 4_C.\n","2119:  These temperatures are understood to be increasing at twice the rate of southern Canada and the global average.\n","2120:  This rise in temperature means that winters are getting shorter and spring and fall are getting relatively longer.\n","2121:  There are significantly fewer very cold days in the winter but no significant change in the number of very hot days (above 30oC) in the summer.\n","2122:  (Furgal and Prowse, 2008; Larsen et al., 2015).\n","2123:  Warmer average temperatures are associated with a wide variety of impacts on Yukon communities and landscapes.\n","2124:  For example, more rapid permafrost thaw is resulting in an increase in impacts on community infrastructure built on permafrost areas.\n","2125:  Warmer temperatures have also resulted in widespread melting of glaciers and the rate of melt continues to increase.\n","2126:  Yukon has lost 22% of its glacial cover over the last 50 years (Derksen et al.\n","2127:  Annual precipitation (rain and snowfall), another important indicator of climate change, has increased by 6% in the Yukon over the past 50 years, with the greatest increase seen during the summer months (Streicker, 2016).\n","2128:  Changes in precipitation cause changes in surface and ground water, permafrost, vegetation and wildlife.\n","2129:  Yukoners have experienced higher summer precipitation and more extreme rain events, associated flood events, permafrost thaw (more snow cover traps heat in the ground), and river bank erosion.\n","2130:  The trend points towards a further increase in annual precipitation and possibly more extreme variability in precipitation as well.\n","2131:  Yukoners have observed an increase in short-term extremes in temperature and precipitation and data suggests that variability is increasing in Yukon.\n","2133:  El Nino During _El Nino_ years, periodic warming of the Pacific Ocean drives warmer and more extreme weather patterns across North America.\n","2134:  In 2015-16 El Nino contributed to Yukon winter temperatures that were almost 70C above seasonal averages (Environment Canada, 2017).\n","2135:  Typically, El Nino years have been observed 5 out of every 100 years, but new research suggests that global climate warming is likely to increase the number of El Nino events to 10 in every 100 years under current emission scenarios (Guojian, et al., 2017).\n","2136:  Figure 1 shows how winter temperatures in 2015/2016 departed from the 1961-1990 average across Canada.\n","2137:  The biggest departure from average occurred in the central Yukon.\n","2138:  RESEARCH NORTHWEST & MORRISON HERSHFIELD 5 Yukon _State of Play_: Analysis of Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation Figure 1: Temperature Departures from the 1960-91 Average _ Winter 2015/2016 November 14, 2017 (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2017) 2.2 EXPECTED FUTURE CHANGES IN TEMPERATURE AND PRECIPITATION The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has developed three scenarios for future temperature changes for Polar Regions.\n","2140:  Temperature is projected to increase by more than 2_C over the next 50 years in Yukon (Streicker, 2016).\n","2141:  Winters are projected to warm faster than any other season (IPCC, 2014).\n","2142:  Precipitation is projected to increase by 10% to 20% over the next 50 years in Yukon.\n","2144:  In practical terms, this means that precipitation is expected to become more variable and increase in summer months.\n","2145:  Snow fall is projected to come later in the fall, become more variable with periods of little snow, and it is likely that intense snow-fall events will be more common (Streicker, 2016).\n","2146:  These expected continuing changes in temperature and precipitation matter to Yukoners as they will need to cope with, and adapt to changes in local environments, impacts on community infrastructure built on permafrost areas, more extreme rain events and associated floods.\n","2147:  For more detail on how Yukon_s climate has changed and how it is expected to change in the future see APPENDIX A at the end of this report.\n","2148:  RESEARCH NORTHWEST & MORRISON HERSHFIELD 6 Yukon _State of Play_: Analysis of Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation 2.2.1 Community-Level Climate Change Projections November 14, 2017 The Scenarios Network for Alaska and Arctic Planning (SNAP) has developed a climate model that projects temperatures and precipitation patterns for approximately 80 locations in the Yukon.\n","2150:  SNAP releases these projections with the qualifier that there is inherent uncertainty in projecting future climate change, but that the value of developing and using the projections in community adaptation planning _allows for greater flexibility in the face of high uncertainty_ (SNAP 2017).\n","2151:  One weakness in the SNAP model is that it does not take temperature inversions (i.e.\n","2152:  significant temperature differences between lower altitude and higher altitude areas) into account, an important issue in many Yukon communities.\n","2153:  We have selected Whitehorse and Old Crow as examples to illustrate what the SNAP model provides.\n","2154:  See APPENDIX A.\n","2156:  In general, the same changes are projected for both Whitehorse and Old Crow with notably warmer temperatures and more precipitation expected in the coming decades.\n","2157:  At a practical level, these trends likely lead to different kinds of anticipated changes in both communities such as: _ A longer growing season that will allow more local agriculture and therefore more local food supply; _ Increased fire risk early in the fire season which will have the effect of extending the fire season and its associated risks and costs; _ A

it is often difficult for many decision-makers to see tangible connections between the issues they are mandated to address and the interaction of these issues with climate change.\n","2229:  _ A challenge in the Yukon, as in the rest of Canada, is that there has been little effort to actively support climate change adaptation through changes to existing legislation or regulations.\n","2230:  In part, this appears to stem from a general reluctance to open legislation for changes and from a lack of clarity or consensus on what changes should be made.\n","2231:  _ Difficulties in integrating adaptation into long-term planning are compounded by limited local-level information or projections about climate change impacts, which serves to increase uncertainty about what actions should be taken to address climate change impacts at a local scale.\n","2232:  _ Financial management and administration systems are sometimes designed in ways that do not adequately consider the long-term

throughout its life including planning, design, construction, operations and maintenance, and any other related costs.\n","2336:  LCC is an excellent tool that lays out the financial case for a decision such as whether to completely renovate an old building for a new use or construct a new building, or to compare the total costs of trade offs between capital and operating costs (e.g., investing more up front in energy efficiency to save on operating costs throughout the life of the building).\n","2337:  November 14, 2017 There is the opportunity for the LCC approach currently used

to estimate the (increased) likelihood of such floods and including the average of repair and disruption costs saved in the LCC may present an opportunity to improve this decision-making process.\n","2341:  Another example may be to develop a metric to estimate the indirect costs incurred (e.g., loss of recreational and social opportunities) when buildings are closed for repairs and include it in the LCC analysis from the onset.\n","2342:  The application of full life-cycle cost accounting to the mining industry presents a more complex challenge.\n","2343:  Mining companies build privately-owned infrastructure on public land and generally have an interest in minimizing their up-front costs.\n","2344:  Unless the mining company is large and has ready access to capital, it may not be able to finance significantly higher capital costs associated with a full LCC analysis even if those result in net financial benefits in the long-term.\n","2345:  Regulators are already

Columbia to survive, thrive and flourish.\n","2720:  The future of species, ecosystems, communities, regions, provinces and future generations will undoubtedly be influenced, in large part, by how we manage this precious resource.\n","2721:  This guide has been developed for local governments, First Nations, and other government agencies, stewardship organizations, water use sectors and community stakeholders.\n","2722:  The purpose of the guide is to help these organizations and individuals: _ Understand the value of water and watershed planning; _ Navigate through the web of current and emerging water issues; _ Understand the range of planning options that are available in BC; and, _ Build capacity to develop and implement plans that will strengthen watershed health and community

watersheds for several immeasurable values including: _ A safe, secure, and adequate supply of water for domestic, agricultural, commercial, industrial, recreational and tourism uses; _ A receiving environment for wastewater discharges; _ Provision of fish, wildlife, habitat and biodiversity; _ Provision of ecosystems services including moderation of flooding, erosion and sedimentation processes; _ A host of other social, cultural, economic and spiritual values.\n","2727:  Planning plays a critical role in how communities define their vision of the future and their path to achieve that vision.\n","2728:  Planning can be reactive or responsive, helping to make course corrections in response to existing issues and challenges.\n","2729:  It can also be proactive in anticipating emerging issues on the horizon and helping communities to prepare for and manage those issues.\n","2730:  When it comes to communities and watersheds, there may be as many different approaches to

will be water supplies for human use, thriving ecosystems and a healthy economy_ both now and in the future._ _Cowichan Basin Water Management Plan, 2007 1 Every living organism, ecosystem and community requires water for life, health and functioning.\n","2768:  The water cycle also influences the availability of many natural resources for communities and the exposure of those communities to water-related hazards.\n","2769:  Biodiversity, ecosystem functioning and most sectors of the economy are highly dependant on water resources and watershed health.\n","2770:  A watershed refers to a region or area of land that drains into a stream, river system or other body of water.\n","2771:  Watersheds capture precipitation, filter and store water, and influence the timing and volume of water flows.\n","2772:  They are integrated systems, with actions in one part of a watershed often impacting other parts of the watershed; therefore, the watershed is an important unit for planning and managing water.\n","2773:  Watershed planning and management seeks to ensure the wise and effective use of water and land resources, and in particular, the quantity, quality and timing of water flows.\n","2774:  Communities rely on water and watersheds for a safe, secure and adequate supply of water for many uses; a receiving environment for wastewater discharges; provision of fish, wildlife, habitat and biodiversity; moderation of flooding, erosion and sedimentation processes; and a host of other social, cultural, economic and spiritual values.\n","2775:  Communities and watersheds are experiencing unprecedented changes at many different scales related to population growth, settlement patterns, use of natural resources, release of waste products into the environment and a changing climate.\n","2776:  These changes can lead to impacts on water resources, watershed health and community sustainability.\n","2777:  Water and watershed planning is about defining and achieving a desired future vision for water resources and watersheds.\n","2778:  Planning plays a critical role in how communities define their vision of the future and their path to achieve this vision.\n","2779:  4 2.1 the V Alue Of PlAnninG Through water-related planning processes, decision makers and the broader community will be better able to understand current and future pressures on water quantity and quality.\n","2780:  They will be better able to manage in the face of those pressures.\n","2781:  For example, population growth projections can inform the potential for growth in water use and demand relative to available supply.\n","2782:  Similarly, future climate scenarios can help users understand if future water supplies might decrease.\n","2783:  By exploring future climate, population, and development scenarios, planners can identify when water use might be projected to exceed supply and can help make the case for water conservation and other strategies to contain demand within supply limits.\n","2784:  There can also be public education benefits associated with planning processes, which can lead to public support in implementing plans and any associated strategies.\n","2785:  The following section will explain what water and watershed planning is, why it is important, when it is needed and the range of options available in BC.\n","2787:  A community vision for a sustainable watershed commonly includes one or more of the following desired outcomes: _ Managing water uses and rates of consumption within available water supplies seasonally, annually and over the long-term _ Developing and managing water supplies in ways that do not compromise the health and biodiversity of fish, wildlife, ecosystems and watersheds _ Managing the allocation of water in ways that support a variety of high-value water uses, including human consumptive and non-consumptive uses as well as instream, environmental uses _ Supporting a wide variety of economic development activities _ Managing wastewater discharges within the capacity of receiving waters to absorb and assimilate those wastes _ Supporting renewable energy sources while minimizing impacts on the environment _ Managing human development patterns in ways that stabilize rather than destabilize the hydrologic cycle _ Managing development in ways that reduce rather than increase the vulnerability of communities to flooding and erosion _ Maintaining and strengthening community resiliency and preparedness for change, including changes in climate Planning can be reactive and responsive to longstanding issues and challenges.\n","2788:  Planning can also be proactive in anticipating challenges that may be emerging on the horizon.\n","2789:  A significant new challenge for water and watershed planning is how to deal with climate change.\n","2790:  Changes in temperature, precipitation and extreme weather events have already influenced hydrology, and subsequent drought, and flooding and erosion effects.\n","2791:  These in turn contribute to a variety of impacts on communities and ecosystems.\n","2793:  Identifying, understanding and preparing for these changes (sometimes referred to as climate change _adaptation_) should become an important component, or a relevant lens to apply, within water and watershed planning processes.\n","2794:  In sections 5, 6 and 7 of this guide the following approaches to planning for water and watersheds are profiled: _ Water Conservation Plans _ Drought Management Plans _ Water Use Plans _ Water Allocation Plans _ Well/Aquifer Protection Plans _ Drinking Water/Source Protection Plans _ Assessment Response Plans _ Water Management Plans (Water Act, Part 4) _ Watershed Management Plans _ Liquid Waste/Integrated Stormwater Management Plans The suitability of these plans for a community, region or watershed will vary significantly depending on the nature and scope of the issues that need to be addressed.\n","2795:  For example, the following are some key considerations: _ Water quantity or quality?\n","2796:  _ Surface or groundwater?\n","2797:  _ Drinking water or instream water?\n","2798:  _ Water use, wastewater discharge, and/or use?\n","2799:  2.2 An intROduCtiOn tO PlAnninG Simply put, planning attempts to logically solve a specific problem or issue and identify steps that can be taken to reach desired future outcomes.\n","2800:  Planning can be initiated either through voluntary means or by regulation.\n","2801:  According to the Canadian Institute of Planners, planning involves the scientific, aesthetic, and orderly disposition of land, resources, facilities and services with a view to securing the physical, economic and social efficiency, health and well-being of urban and rural communities.2 The goals of planning are oriented towards the future.\n","2802:  Therefore, planning is an ongoing, dynamic process that needs to be attuned and adaptive to changing environmental conditions, social outlooks and community visions.\n","2803:  The Planning Process Approaches used in planning processes vary greatly.\n","2805:  The approach selected is determined, in part, by the characteristics of the planning area, the specific issues being addressed, the needs and interests of the community, and the individuals involved.\n","2806:  Planning for complex environmental, social or economic problems typically requires a process design that integrates most, if not all, of the following steps: 3, 4 5 _ Consult with those affected to improve the quality of decisions and build community confidence in the fairness of outcomes.\n","2807:  _ Give high priority to ensuring that the values and interests of indigenous peoples are included.\n","2808:  _ Develop capacity for learning and improving over time and the ability to evaluate the process.\n","2809:  _ Provide adequate resources to develop and implement water plans and evaluate their outcomes.\n","2810:  _ Improve monitoring and compliance of the use of water and other watershed resources.\n","2811:  Ideally, watershed plans and the organizations involved in implementing the plans should emerge from the planning process with: _ Improved understanding of the watershed and how it functions _ Clear objectives of how to manage the water sustainably and in an integrated manner _ Clearly specified community and environmental outcomes _ Decisions that are based on the best available information _ Adequately resourced management and implementation _ Good integration with other regional and resource-based plans It should be acknowledged that planning would not solve all of the water-related challenges and conflicts throughout BC.\n","2812:  However, it is an important component of the management and governance of water resources and watersheds.\n","2813:  2.3 An intROduCtiOn tO WAteRsheds Everything in the natural world is connected to other parts.\n","2815:  A watershed_ an area of land that contributes runoff to a lake, river, stream, estuary or bay_is a complex and dynamic natural system.\n","2816:  Changes to land cover in upland regions of a watershed affect downstream hydrology; waste inputs from one community can affect water quality further downstream.\n","2817:  Impacts to an aquifer, such as water withdrawal, may ultimately affect the flow and health of a nearby stream.\n","2818:  The various resources that interact within a watershed_the land, the surface and ground water, the air and the organisms within the watershed_cannot be considered in isolation.\n","2819:  By recognizing the interconnections between the components of a watershed and by integrating this understanding into planning and decision making within and across watershed boundaries, negative human impacts on watershed health are more likely to be more effectively managed.\n","2820:  _ Involve key decision makers and partners.\n","2821:  Consider who should be engaged in the process in order for it to work.\n","2823:  _ Characterize the area / issue to identify problems.\n","2824:  If a problem is defined too narrowly, innovative solutions may be overlooked.\n","2825:  _ Model or analyze the situation or problem.\n","2826:  It is important to understand the causes of the problem, as well as the dynamics that may help solve it.\n","2827:  _ Set goals and identify potential solutions, including resource requirements, and implementation and feedback procedures.\n","2828:  _ Evaluate potential solutions in terms of technical feasibility, cost effectiveness, probable effects and political acceptability _ Make decisions and design an implementation program.\n","2829:  _ Implement solutions and take action.\n","2830:  _ Monitor and evaluate the success of the plan and its implementation.\n","2831:  _ Modify the plan as required.\n","2832:  Planning with water in mind, or water centric planning, is a primary objective of Living Water Smart, British Columbia_s Water Plan.\n","2833:  Historically, the provincial government coordinated planning for water resources.\n","2834:  More recently, First Nations, local governments, stewardship groups and other community stakeholders have shared this responsibility.\n","2835:  Examples of collaborative approaches to planning are profiled throughout this guide.\n","2836:  Living Water Smart advocates for water and watershed planning to continue to be a shared, collaborative endeavour.\n","2837:  There is no absolute template to follow for water and watershed planning.\n","2838:  Every planning process and every plan is different.\n","2839:  There are, however, many elements that are critical to the success of watershed plans.\n","2841:  _ Seek involvement and support from elected decision-makers and those with legislative or regulatory responsibilities.\n","2843:  _ Ensure full representation of all affected parties, while keeping the size of the process workable.\n","2844:  _ Ensure that the planning process is understood, used and broadly supported.\n","2845:  _ Provide access to appropriate technical and analytical skills and information resources.\n","2846:  _ Obtain sustainable funding.\n","2847:  _ Strive for planning that is done before further development will undermine the effectiveness of the plan.\n","2848:  _ Factor in the impacts of climate change and interception activities (e.g., farm dams and forestry) on future water inflows and recharge.\n","2849:  _ Include socio-economic analyses to inform planning.\n","2850:  6 Understanding the hydrologic cycle is critical to understanding how a watershed functions.\n","2851:  While both salt water and freshwater are essential parts of the water cycle, the freshwater that we use on a daily basis for drinking water, irrigation, andother uses comprises only 1% of all water on Earth.\n","2852:  This small proportion of water is _recycled_ through the hydrologic cycle, year after year, through oceans, rivers, rain and the atmosphere (Figure 1).\n","2853:  When water falls to the earth as either rain or snow, it either: _ Soaks into the ground _ Flows over the surface of the land into a stream, lake, wetland or the ocean, or _ Returns to the atmosphere through evaporation.\n","2854:  The rate of infiltration within a watershed is determined by many factors, including soil permeability, rate of precipitation and the amount and type of vegetation cover on the land surface.\n","2855:  Human activity can alter the rate of infiltration by changing the surface of the land.\n","2856:  When rain falls or snow melts too fast to allow for infiltration, or when the ground is too hard (impermeable) for infiltration to occur, such as in an urban environment, the water flows over the land as surface runoff (also called overland flow).\n","2857:  Surface runoff is evident within a watershed as streams, rivers, lakes, ponds, wetlands and drainage ditches.\n","2858:  Water that infiltrates into the ground can take one of several routes: _ Plant roots may absorb the water, which will be used for photosynthesis.\n","2859:  This water will eventually leave the plant through the leaves, transpiring back into the atmosphere.\n","2860:  _ Water that is not taken up by plants percolates downwards through the soil to the fully saturated zone at the level of the water table, where it becomes groundwater.\n","2861:  Significant collections of groundwater are called aquifers.\n","2862:  Aquifers are sometimes tapped with wells for drinking

vulnerabilities, risks, and risk management strategies.\n","2887:  Lastly, this section includes some examples of how these issues can be integrated into water and watershed planning processes to help communities address the impacts of climate change.\n","2888:  8 3.1 ClimA te ChAnGe imPACts On W AteR Climate, in a narrow sense, is usually defined as the _average weather_ over a period of time.\n","2890:  Climate change refers to a change in the state of the climate which can be identified by changes in the mean and/or variability of these parameters, and which persists for a period of decades or longer.\n","2891:  2 Climate change science suggests that by the middle of the century (2050s), mean annual temperatures across BC will be 1-3_ C warmer on average.\n","2892:  Extremely warm temperatures will become more frequent.\n","2893:  A warmer climate will increase growing degree days and frost free days _ increasing the potential for plant growth.\n","2894:  In winter, most parts of BC will receive up to 20% more precipitation.\n","2895:  In summer, northern BC will be up to 10% wetter, and southern BC will be up to 15% drier.\n","2896:  In winter and spring, snowfall will decrease.\n","2898:  Water resources and the hydrologic cycle are significantly influenced by the climate.\n","2899:  Therefore, water resources are highly sensitive to year-to-year climate variability as well as long-term changes in climate.\n","2900:  Changes in air temperature and precipitation patterns are noticeably affecting our weather, water cycles and ecology, and are creating impacts on forests, fisheries, agriculture, recreational opportunities and communities across the province.\n","2901:  Climate change includes changes in the average climate, such as a general warming in mean annual air temperature, and changes in the frequency of extreme temperature and precipitation events.\n","2902:  Changes in climate will affect physical systems, including stream flows.\n","2903:  Impacts will vary from one location to another and will include lower _normal_ stream flows (i.e., average seasonal and annual flows) and more frequent drought and flood conditions.\n","2904:  There may also be larger streamflows in some regions including larger and earlier peak flows.\n","2905:  Changes in both climate averages and extremes may have a wide range of impacts on water and watershed resources and these impacts will vary between different regions of the province.\n","2906:  Therefore, we need to consider these impacts within water and watershed plans to strengthen the ability of communities to manage such impacts.\n","2909:  These and other climate-related impacts will be discussed in more detail in Sections 3, 5, 6 and 7 of this guide, along with suggestions on how to integrate and address these issues within water and watershed plans.\n","2910:  As expressed in Living Water Smart, British Columbia_s Water Plan,_we need to design our communities to adapt to our changing climate while thinking long term to revitalize our natural systems_.\n","2911:  At a 2008 conference of the BC Water and Waste Association, Jim Mattison, former Assistant Deputy Minister, Water Stewardship Division, BC Ministry of Environment, spoke to water managers about the two responses to climate change: mitigation and adaptation._Mitigation and adaptation are both necessary and complementary strategies to cope with the climate change challenge.\n","2912:  If mitigation (alleviating the effects of climate change through reducing greenhouse gasses) is about carbon, then adaptation (preparing for the changes that occur) is about water_.\n","2913:  4 While human systems within impacted watersheds _may adapt to climate change, albeit at some cost, natural ecosystems and wildlife cannot adapt very quickly to a sudden, large change and hence are at risk._ 5 Climate change impacts on water resources, watershed health, and communities are anticipated to be complex and significant, and are expected to vary for different regions of the province.\n","2915:  In general there are four different types of watersheds with different hydrological regimes, and differences in how these watersheds are affected by climate change need to be considered within water, watershed, and/or adaptation planning: _ Rain-dominated watersheds _ Snow-dominated watersheds _ Transition watersheds _ Coastal watersheds (rain and transition, but with added the impact of sea level rise).\n","2916:  The range of potential climate-related impacts on water, watersheds and communities across BC include the following (see also setion 9.\n","2917:  Tools and Resources for other sources of information on climate impacts): Hydrology and Geomorphology _ Changes in the hydrology of rivers, streams and watersheds, including the volume and timing of water discharge (e.g., increased frequency and magnitude of both peak [flood] flows and low [drought] flows) _ Changes in the geomorphology of rivers, streams and watersheds, including the volume, sources and destinations of sediment transport (e.g., increased rates and shifting locations of erosion and sedimentation processes) Water Quantity _ In some regions, more frequent water shortages and increased potential for competition among water uses (e.g., hydroelectricity, irrigation, communities, recreation and instream flow needs for aquatic ecosystems), with implications for transboundary agreements in some cases.\n","2918:  _ In some regions there may be an overall reduction in annual water supply, particularly where water supplies are partially dependent on snowpack or glaciers and where water storage is limited.\n","2919:  9 First Nations Concerns First Nations in Canada have also identified and expressed concerns about these potential climate change impacts.\n","2920:  In workshops held in Toronto and Vancouver in the summer of 2010, 18 First Nations from across Canada identified potential policy directions related to First Nations, water security and climate change.\n","2921:  A report emerging from these workshops indicated that First Nations in rural areas are experiencing various impacts of climate change on water resources, including: 6 _ Poor water quality; _ Increasing drought; _ Rapid glacier melt; _ Widespread thawing of permafrost; _ Earlier peak streamflows; _ Changing water temperatures; and _ Shifting marine ecosystems.\n","2922:  Other climate change impacts on water and watersheds identified as being of relevance to First Nations in BC include: _ Increased flood damage to buildings, roads, bridges, rail lines; _ Increased air pollution and exposure to water- and food-borne pathogens; _ Increased risk to water quantity due to low water levels; and _ Increased risk to water quality due coastal erosion and storm surges.\n","2923:  Climate change has also impacted First Nations_ ability to harvest fish, both commercially and for subsistence purposes, due to significant changes in fish habitat, migratory patterns and spawning beds, and to changes in water quality and temperature.\n","2924:  Water Quality _ Increased risk, frequency and magnitude of extreme precipitation events and related natural hazards such as flood and erosion, resulting in loss or degradation of land; deposition of silt, sand, gravel and debris; damage to and disruption of critical infrastructure, property, community services, farmland, businesses and the environment.\n","2925:  _ Increased risks of other water-related hazards such as debris flows, landslides and avalanches.\n","2926:  _ During periods of low water flows, normal waste discharges will result in higher concentrations of pollutants within water bodies that receive those wastes _ Saltwater intrusion in coastal regions due to a rise in sea level, in particular in combination with reduced groundwater tables.\n","2927:  _ Increased water turbidity from increased flooding, erosion and sediment transport, with potential health impacts from water-borne pathogens.\n","2928:  Aquatic Ecosystems _ Continued stresses on fish migration patterns and survival rates of some populations due to a variety of impacts to freshwater and marine habitat, including warming water temperatures, low freshwater flows in late summer and early autumn in some regions, degradation of spawning and rearing habitat, and changes to food availability and predators in the marine environment 10 _ Forests that are stressed_ for example, from reduced water supply _are more vulnerable to diseases and pests such as the mountain pine beetle.\n","2929:  Climate change can therefore lead indirectly to changes in forest cover over large regions, which in turn can affect watershed functions and processes.\n","2930:  _ Longer and drier summers in BC with increased severity and length of the fire season.\n","2932:  _ Increased impacts on drainage systems.\n","2933:  _ Increased risk of damage and disruption to transportation, energy, communications, and other critical infrastructure due to flooding and erosion.\n","2934:  The impacts above can interact with a variety of different community and/or ecosystem vulnerabilities such as: _ Vulnerability of water supplies (quantity and quality) to flooding, erosion, turbidity, drought and saltwater intrusion; _ Vulnerability of all water use sectors to reduced water supplies and increased conflict; _ Vulnerability of aquatic and marine ecosystems to warming water temperatures, shifting hydrological and geomorphological regimes, low instream flows and shifts in the food web; and _ Vulnerability of people, infrastructure (including but not limited to drinking water, wastewater and drainage infrastructure), community services and property due to water_related natural hazards such as flooding, erosion, debris flows, landslides and avalanches.\n","2935:  In many cases, there can be a cascade of climate-related impacts.\n","2936:  For example, more frequent and/or extreme rainfall events are a highly probable impact of climate change in many areas of BC.\n","2937:  This can lead to high flows in streams, rivers and drainage systems, which can cause flooding, erosion, mobilization of contaminants and downstream sedimentation.\n","2938:  Depending on the location and design of community water and wastewater systems, flooding may impact the quality of community water supplies, damage or disrupt the operation of water or wastewater treatment systems, and damage or disrupt other infrastructure and property.\n","2939:  There may also be a risk to life or injury due to flood events.\n","2940:  Although flooding and erosion are natural processes, extreme rainfall events can have adverse impacts on the environment, including degradation of water quality, habitat, and other ecosystem functions and services.\n","2941:  This can, in turn, adversely impact social, cultural and economic values that are derived from healthy and abundant watershed resources.\n","2942:  Thus, a single storm event can result in devastating, widespread and long-lasting impacts to the health, resiliency and sustainability of communities, water resources and watersheds.\n","2943:  3.2 PRePARinG fOR ClimA te ChAnGe _ the AdAPt AtiOn PROCess And W AteR And WAteRshed PlAnninG Because of the many, significant, current and projected impacts of climate change on water resources and watersheds, the value of planning and adaptation should be self-evident.\n","2944:  The better we are able to understand the changes that are coming and how they are affecting communities and ecosystems, the better we will be able to plan for, manage and adapt to these changes.\n","2945:  Many methodologies have been developed to help communities learn more about the regional impacts of climate change, prioritize associated risks and opportunities, and develop climate risk available, communities have been able to obtain it by engaging consultants or the Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium, or by working with academic researchers and students.\n","2946:  While many communities believe they need accurate information about future climate and future impacts on water and watersheds, in many cases general information about the direction of these impacts will be adequate for initial planning purposes.\n","2947:  The following information, for example, can guide water and watershed management decisions: _ Whether or not regional snowpack (a low-cost water storage mechanism) will likely decrease in future; _ Whether or not summer flows will likely be lower in future, with impacts for water temperature and health of fish stocks; or _ Whether or not heavy rainfall events _ sociated with flooding and stream turbidity _ are becoming more frequent.\n","2948:  3.2.2 exPlORinG lOCAl And ReGiOnAl VulneRAbility tO ClimA te ChAnGe How will the impacts of climate change affect water supply, demand, quality and watershed health in my region?\n","2949:  Science alone cannot provide all the information water and watershed planners need to prepare for climate change.\n","2950:  In many cases it is local people who are in the best position to identify the water and watershed values they care about, how sensitive those values are to year-to-year changes in climate, and local capacity to address existing problems.\n","2952:  Vulnerability assessment looks specifically at the ability of the community to address emerging pressures related to climate.\n","2954:  In particular, how have extreme weather events affected our water supply or watershed in the past?\n","2955:  _ Given projected climate change and related impacts: Is the community water supply likely to increase or decrease?\n","2956:  Is damage to water infrastructure likely to increase or decrease?\n","2957:  _ How prepared is our community to projected changes?\n","2959:  In many cases, climate change will exacerbate existing management challenges, such as water shortages, water use conflicts, protecting water quality and managing natural hazards _ things that communities are already struggling to address.\n","2960:  Some of these methodologies are listed in in Section 9 Tools and Resources.\n","2962:  This guide suggests that many water and watershed planning processes should consider climate change and its impacts, focusing on how climate has changed and is likely to change within the planning region, and the impacts of a changing climate on water and watersheds within the planning region.\n","2963:  Users of this guide are referred to existing generic methodologies identified in Tools and Resources and on the ReTooling website for details on the steps involved in identifying regional impacts, vulnerabilities, and risks, and relevant risk management strategies.\n","2965:  3.2.1 leARninG AbOut ReGiOnAl ClimA te ChAnGe imPACts What are the impacts of climate

one region to another.\n","2967:  Information about changes in climate, changes in hydrology, and changes in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems in BC during the past century is available from reports published by the BC Ministry of Environment, Natural Resources Canada, and the Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium.\n","2968:  See Tools and Resources for links to key publications.\n","2969:  The planning tool Plan2Adapt provides a good starting point for learning about future climate.\n","2970:  It provides regionally relevant information about projected climate for 2020s, 2050s, and 2080s, based on a standard set of climate model projections.\n","2971:  It presents this information in the form of simple-to-understand maps, graphs and text.\n","2972:  Users can view the information

to future stream flows, water availability, and watershed health in the planning region.\n","2977:  Much of the existing information on these topics is provincial in scope.\n","2979:  Not all of the existing information is written in simple language.\n","2980:  Section 9 Tools and Resources provides links to key sources of information about impacts on water and watersheds.\n","2981:  Where

priorities for my community in terms of the hazards and consequences?\n","2983:  Preparing for climate change can be approached as just another aspect of risk management.\n","2984:  Risk is the product of the likelihood of a hazard (e.g., flood, fire, drought, water contamination, landslide) occurring, and the consequences of exposure to that hazard.\n","2985:  Communities can manage risk by reducing exposure to a hazard or by minimizing its consequences.\n","2986:  Sometimes climate change will introduce a new hazard (for example sea level rise, glacier loss), or a new consequence (for example new, invasive species).\n","2987:  More often, climate change will increase or decrease the likelihood that a hazard will occur.\n","2988:  Water and watershed planners can use their knowledge of regional climate changes and its impacts to inform a basic risk assessment.\n","2989:  Planners should also consider whether climate change presents new hazards or consequences relevant to water and watershed planning.\n","2990:  3.2.4 identifyinG ClimA te Risk mAnAGement stRA teGies What are the most important short, medium and long-term strategies that my community can implement to reduce the risks and impacts of climate change?\n","2991:  Once communities have a deeper understanding of past and future climate change, potential impacts, local vulnerabilities, and priority risks, they will be in a good position to identify, evaluate and select strategies that will minimize local or regional climate- related risks.\n","2992:  Most of these strategies will look familiar.\n","2993:  Where climate change will likely reduce supply, communities can: _ Develop water conservation and/or drought management plans.\n","2994:  _ Reduce demand through conservation meausres or more efficient water use.\n","2995:  _ Expand the storage capacity of existing water supplies.\n","2996:  _ Develop new water supplies or retention structures.\n","2997:  Where climate change will have negative effects on Water Quality, communities can: _ Change design capacity of drainage infrastructure such as storm sewers, catch basins, and erosion protection structures.\n","2998:  _ Manage rainwater on-site to ease demands on drainage infrastructure.\n","2999:  _ Where climate change will negatively affect Other Water and Watershed Values communities can: _ Protect wetlands and other sensitive habitats.\n","3000:  _ Restore riparian and instream habitat.\n","3001:  Currently, there is no list of _best practices_ for adaptation.\n","3002:  This is because climate change and its impacts vary from one location to another, and communities vary in their exposure and ability to cope.\n","3003:  In addition, vision, values, risk tolerance, priorities, resources, and other factors vary from one community to another, so even those facing similar risks and opportunities may make different adaptation choices.\n","3004:  Thus, while many adaptation options are theoretically possible, communities should evaluate to the extent possible the likely local costs and benefits of specific strategies before selecting those they wish to implement.\n","3005:  Where climate change exacerbates existing management challenges, such as water shortages, water use conflicts, protecting water quality and managing natural hazards, consideration must be given to the degree to which climate change is compounding those problems and to how strategies and responses need to be refined to address additional pressures related to climate change.\n","3006:  _No regrets_ actions that address both current and future risk are particularly popular.\n","3007:  12 3.3 inteGRA tinG AdAPt AtiOn intO W AteR And W AteRshed PlAnninG _ sOme exAmPles How can my community integrate climate

challenges, such as water shortages, water use conflicts, protecting water quality and managing natural hazards.\n","3010:  Therefore, when adaptation is integrated into water and watershed plans, consideration must be given to the degree to which climate change is compounding those problems and to how strategies and responses need to be refined to address additional pressures related to climate change.\n","3011:  The ways in which adaptation is integrated into water and watershed planning will be influenced somewhat by the scope and detail of a particular plan.\n","3012:  For example, if the plan presents broad goals and objectives, references to climate change adaptation may be general.\n","3013:  However, if very specific targets and strategies are identified, the climate change scenarios, impacts, vulnerabilities and risks should inform those targets and strategies.\n","3015:  _ A stormwater, drainage, or flood management plan would be informed by current hydrological information and by an understanding of how the hydrological regime is anticipated to shift in response to climate change.\n","3016:  _ A drinking water protection plan would be informed by information and knowledge about all possible threats to water quality, including climate-related impacts such as increased peak flows and turbidity.\n","3017:  3.4 RefeRenCes 1 Centre for

Who does What in Water?\n","3033:  This section of the guide provides an overview of the wide range of roles and responsibilities of all orders of government and other organizations in water management in BC.\n","3034:  Depending on the scope of a particular water or watershed planning process, many of these organizations will have a role in planning.\n","3035:  The diversity of responsibilities reinforces the value of implementing collaborative approaches to planning and governance.\n","3036:  It is important to understand how and where water and watershed planning fits within the larger context of water management and governance.\n","3037:  For this guide, water management is described as including the following components: _ Policies (e.g., legislation, regulations and other types of policies); _ Governance arrangements (e.g., formal agreements and protocols, financial mechanisms, collaborative decision-making processes, and consultation, advisory and public participation processes); _ Planning (e.g., a variety of processes to develop water plans, watershed plans, and other types of plans such as official community plans); and _ Implementation (e.g., implementation of policies and plans, operation of water and wastewater facilities, compliance and enforcement of regulations).\n","3038:  Resources such as information, financial and human resources can also be considered to be a key component of water management.\n","3039:  This guide focuses on the planning component of water management.\n","3040:  However, it also speaks to other components as they relate to planning.\n","3041:  For example, this section includes an overview of the range of water management roles and responsibilities that exist among a wide variety of organizations.\n","3042:  Governance can be described in terms of who makes decisions and how they are made.\n","3043:  While government is critical to governance, the concept is broader than government.\n","3045:  In addition, water user groups, watershed stewards, the general public and other stakeholders are increasingly becoming involved in planning, management and decision making for our water resources.\n","3046:  14 4.1 PROVinCiAl GOVeRnment Under the Canadian Constitution Act, provinces and territories have primary responsibility for water management, with a number of ministries and agencies sharing responsibility for different aspects of water management.\n","3047:  The Province is the lead jurisdiction for setting policy, legislating prices, permitting uses, and managing water sources in BC.\n","3048:  Provincial jurisdiction includes public lands, municipal institutions, local works and undertakings, non-renewable resources, property and civil rights, and shared jurisdiction over agriculture.1 Typically, the Province devolves the responsibility of community-scale water management to municipalities or other local organizations such as water suppliers.\n","3049:  In British Columbia, the BC Water Act (administered by the Ministry Forests, Lands and Natural Resource Operations) and the Drinking Water Protection Act (administered by the Ministry of Health) provide the basic regulatory framework for water management.\n","3051:  Ministry of Environment (MoE) The MoE provides leadership for water stewardship and promotes responsible water use, community health and safety, maintenance of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, and other priorities.\n","3052:  The Ministry applies a stewardship approach based on the principles of integrated water resource management.\n","3053:  The Ministry of Environment works in partnership with other agencies (such as the Ministry of Forests, Lands and Natural Resource Operations) to deliver this mandate and ensure the health of the province_s water resource.\n","3054:  MoE roles include: _ Parks, wilderness and protected areas; _ Air, land and water quality standards; _ Pollution prevention and waste management; _ Species and ecosystem protection policy; _ Water protection and water sustainability policy; _ Water and air monitoring and reporting; _ Conservation and resource management enforcement; _ Climate action secretariat; _ Environmental assessment office; _ State of environment reporting; and, _ Environmental monitoring.\n","3055:  The MoE also provides the following support roles in water stewardship, including: _ Assists with policy and plan development; _ Assists with continual evolution of legislation and policy; _ Develops innovative approaches to water governance; _ Assists with the development of regulatory and non-regulatory tools; _ Leads and reports on living water smart implementation; _ Provides source water protection; _ Provides groundwater monitoring and protection; and, _ Provides water quality and quantity monitoring.\n","3056:  The Ministry provides information, research and knowledge about BC_s water resources: _ Collects water-related data; _ Provides scientific analysis and guidance in support of planning and stewardship; _ Provides forecasts and models to support risk management and decision making; and, _ Collaborates in water science research.\n","3059:  Ministry of Health _ Administers the drinking water protection act and associated regulations; _ Mandate for drinking water protection under the

provincial government released Living Water Smart: British Columbia_s Water Plan.\n","3071:  The plan establishes new provincial water priorities to keep our water healthy and secure for the future by taking into consideration the challenging context of water management in BC today.\n","3072:  In anticipation of continuing competing demands for water, a growing population, and the effects of climate change on our communities, Living Water Smart outlines 45 new commitments, divided into three categories: _ Doing Business Differently.\n","3073:  _ Preparing Communities for Change.\n","3074:  _ Choosing to Be Water Smart.\n","3075:  The plan sets specific commitments and targets to help ensure that a finite supply of water (or potentially a reduced supply) will go further without

drinking water sources.\n","3080:  _ 50% of new municipal water needs will be acquired through conservation by 2020.\n","3081:  Many of these commitments and targets will have direct impacts on communities across the province.\n","3082:  To help advance these commitments, the plan draws on a variety of policy _tools_, including planning, regulatory change, education, and incentives like economic instruments and rewards.\n","3083:  2 See Living Water Smart: http://livingwatersmart.ca/ for more information.\n","3084:  16 Looking Ahead _ Modernizing the Water Act As part of the commitment to Living Water Smart, and in response to new water management challenges including population growth and climate change, the BC Government is looking at ways to modernize the Water Act.\n","3085:  Initiated in 2008, this significant undertaking is considering new arrangements to address water management challenges in BC, with the following goals: 1.\n","3086:  Protect stream

more information.\n","3093:  At the time this Guide was published, Government was further refining the proposal and assessing implications.\n","3094:  Every effort will be made to update this Guide to reflect any changes to planning related to the Water Sustainability Act if and when it is enacted.\n","3096:  All existing and new large groundwater users throughout the province will be required to obtain a licence or an approval; _ Regulating water during times of scarcity using a staged approach that includes efficiency and conservation measures, priority date and proportional reduction targets; _ Enabling a range of economic instruments, incentives and best management practices to improve water security, water use efficiency, conservation and beneficial use; _ Additional

the ability to delegate responsibility for activities and decisions to others; _ Water resource assessments that consider available and anticipated water supply and demand, and potential conditions for water use; _ Watershed sustainability plans in areas where degraded watersheds require recovery action and will affect both land and water development and use.\n","3097:  4.2 fedeRAl GOVeRnment The Constitution Act assigns the federal government a specific set of water management responsibilities, including navigable waters, commercial fisheries and fish habitat, water on First Nations land, transboundary flows, international relations, trade and commerce, agriculture, and federal lands.\n","3098:  1 The federal government also develops water policy.\n","3099:  For example, refer to:

Natural Resources Canada _ Conducts research on groundwater and hydrologic impacts of climate change.\n","3107:  Over the years, the federal government has also had roles in funding infrastructure, including water, wastewater and flood protection infrastructure.\n","3108:  In 2011, at the time this guide was completed, these functions were implemented through the Building Canada Fund, administered by Infrastructure Canada.\n","3109:  4.3 fiRst nA tiOns GOVeRnment At present, the roles of First Nations in water planning, management and governance relate to legally assigned responsibilities in the administration of federal water policies, and the management of provincially or federally assigned roles.\n","3110:  While Aboriginal rights to water have not been eliminated, and governance (i.e.\n","3111:  jurisdiction) of water resources is a goal for many BC First Nations, few if any existing forums formalize Aboriginal rights to, and governance of, water.\n","3113:  These licences are held either by a First Nation or jointly by the First Nation and Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada.\n","3114:  Legally, the protection and provision of water to First Nations is a responsibility of the federal government, specifically Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada (AANDC).\n","3115:  Band Councils, AANDC and Health Canada share responsibilities for providing water services to Aboriginal communities.\n","3117:  AANDC provides financial assistance for water facilities, and Health Canada works with communities to ensure water quality monitoring programs are in place, trains the monitors, and provides community-based education on water issues.3 However, concerns about the extent to which the federal government has met these responsibilities are well documented.\n","3118:  Many First Nations have been left with limited capacity to manage water resources, and as a result, their populations are disproportionately vulnerable to water-borne diseases, drinking water advisories and health effects associated with poor water quality.\n","3119:  4 Legally, the provincial government is obligated to consult with First Nations on water use decisions that might affect them.\n","3120:  This relationship is defined by the Supreme Court of Canada (e.g., Delgamukw and Haida), and is reflected in the _New Relationship_ that was struck in 2005 between the Province and the First Nations Leadership Council.\n","3122:  In BC, local government includes municipalities, regional districts, and improvement districts.\n","3123:  In order for local governments to have jurisdiction over specific subjects, they first need authorization from the Province under the Community Charter and the Local Government Act.\n","3124:  It is important to note that municipalities and regional districts have somewhat different jurisdictions and procedures.\n","3125:  For example, for some water-related functions such as drainage and flood protection, regional districts may need to first establish a specific function and service delivery area following a referendum to confirm (or deny) public consent.\n","3126:  In BC, local governments are gaining more discretionary powers over local matters, as demonstrated by changes to the Community Charter.6 The following are some of the key local government roles and responsibilities in water management and planning: _ Development and management of municipal water supplies, including treatment and distribution systems.\n","3127:  This includes provision of safe drinking water in accordance with the public health act; _ Development and management of municipal drainage and wastewater treatment systems; _ Responsibility for floodplain management under the flood hazard statutes amendment act; _ Delivery of local water conservation programs; _ Responsibility for local land use planning and development on private lands, including the protection and management of riparian areas, wetlands and other sensitive habitats; _ Responsibility for the operation and maintenance of flood protection infrastructure in their local areas; and, _ Water and watershed planning.\n","3128:  17 Local governments have contributed to water management planning across the province by initiating, managing and participating in various activities related to water management and planning, including: _ Developing water conservation plans and drought management plans; _ Participating in or leading multi-sector water planning initiatives; _ Developing floodplain management plans and strategies; _ Developing liquid waste management plans and integrated stormwater management plans; _ Developing integrated watershed management plans; and _ Developing official community plans and regional growth strategies.\n","3130:  8 In addition to the planning processes listed above (and those discussed in Sections 5 through 7 of the guide), local governments across BC are drawing on other innovative tools and approaches to help protect watersheds and plan for water resources.\n","3131:  4.5 OtheR ORGAnizA tiOns Many other organizations have important roles to play when it comes to water.\n","3133:  BC Hydro _ Is licensed to use the largest amount of surface water in the province, with operations that depend on reliable, carefully managed water supplies; _ Works to reduce the need to expand hydropower operations by encouraging consumer energy conservation; and, _ Develops water use plans, which modify hydropower dam operations to mitigate their impact on downstream fish habitat and other values.\n","3134:  Academic Institutions _ Conduct critical research on topics such as water quality and quantity, impacts of climate change, watershed functioning, groundwater and

consider in water supply and demand planning and management.\n","3175:  It is also becoming increasingly important to consider the impacts of climate change when planning and managing water supply and demand.\n","3176:  Climate change is having, and will continue to have, far-reaching implications on all aspects of water management.\n","3177:  In Canada, water allocation and licensing decisions are the responsibility of the provincial government.\n","3178:  In BC, these responsibilities are administered by the Ministry of Forests, Lands, and Natural Resource Operations (MFLNRO), which issues water licences.\n","3179:  MFLNRO balances responsible use, community health and safety, maintaining terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and other priorities.\n","3180:  Once water licences are issued, the management of water supply and demand becomes largely the responsibility of those that hold the licenses including local governments, First Nations, and other community-scale water suppliers.\n","3184:  Local governments, First Nations and other water suppliers also participate in, or lead, multi-sector water and watershed planning initiatives.\n","3186:  Types of Water Supply & Demand Plans This section of the guide profiles four specific types of plans: _ Water Conservation Plans _ Drought Management Plans _ Water Use Plans _ Water Allocation Plans 20 water demand is nearing or exceeding water supply.\n","3189:  Total and Seasonal Population Growth Some communities and regions, such as the Lower Mainland, the east coast of Vancouver Island and parts of the Thompson-Okanagan region, are experiencing significant population growth.\n","3190:  This growth puts increased demand and pressure on existing water supplies, particularly where supplies are already stressed.\n","3191:  Communities that are heavily influenced by seasonal tourism may have unique challenges in managing seasonal fluctuations in demand for domestic use.\n","3192:  For example, in Tofino, the population grows 10-fold in the summer because of the significant amount of tourism in the area.\n","3193:  This is the same time when the creeks are at their lowest flow-levels.\n","3194:  Drought Conditions When communities are faced with water shortages or drought conditions, conflicts between different water users may emerge or increase.\n","3195:  For example, in 2003, Summerland_s water supply was substantially depleted, which resulted in a significant conflict between the provision of water in streams to ensure fish survival and the provision of water for farmers and food production.\n","3196:  In extreme cases, senior levels of government may intervene in water allocation issues.\n","3197:  In the spring of 2010, the BC Ministry of Environment used its authority under the Water Act, to change the regulated amount of diversion and use of water, and invoked priority rights in the Chimney Lakes area.\n","3198:  Surface and Groundwater Interactions Conflicts may also arise between users of surface water and users of groundwater because these sources are often closely linked.\n","3199:  For example, excessive withdrawal of groundwater may reduce groundwater contribution to instream flows, particularly in the dry summer months when streams, aquatic ecosystems and other users of surface water are most vulnerable to low flows.\n","3200:  Also excessive surface water withdrawal can lead to groundwater sources being depleted, as some aquifers are recharged from surface supplies such as rivers.\n","3201:  Aging and Inadequate Infrastructure Many BC communities are also facing challenges associated with aging infrastructure, such as inadequate supply capacity or leaky distribution systems.\n","3202:  Water infrastructure is very expensive to replace and upgrade, and often water conservation is viewed as a preferable alternative to increasing capacity.\n","3203:  Because of the wider infrastructure deficit throughout BC and Canada, water infrastructure _ for water supply and distribution, wastewater treatment, drainage and flood protection _ has to compete with other types of infrastructure for limited capital funds.\n","3204:  21 Why Plan for Water Supply and Demand?\n","3207:  Therefore the extent of existing water use requirements and the hydrological characteristics of watersheds are important considerations in managing supply and demand.\n","3208:  BC communities are adopting a wide range of strategies to manage water.\n","3209:  Water planning processes can help communities understand challenges by improving knowledge about water supplies and demands including sharing the allocation of water across various human activities and also ensuring that environmental needs (i.e.\n","3210:  instream flows) are also met.\n","3211:  For a comparison of three water management techniques (supply side, demand management, and the _soft path_ approach) see the 2005 POLIS publication At a Watershed.\n","3212:  These approaches can be especially helpful in managing community conflicts during times of water shortages and drought.\n","3213:  The process of water management planning also serves to increase awareness in a community, and stakeholders will be more likely to promote responsible water management practices in their homes, businesses and neighbourhoods.\n","3214:  Water supply, demand and allocation management are primarily about balancing water use.\n","3216:  Good water management can allow for human use without compromising the environment.\n","3217:  Desired outcomes of water planning may include: _ Managing water use and consumption rates to account for seasonal and annual changes (e.G.\n","3218:  Reducing use in months that are especially dry and in years with lower snowpacks and less recharge of water supplies) _ Managing water use and consumption rates for long term changes in an area, such as climate change and population growth _ Developing and managing water supplies in ways that do not compromise the health and biodiversity of fish, wildlife, ecosystems and watersheds in general _ Managing for recreational non-consumptive water uses, such as swimming, fishing and canoeing _ Managing the future allocation of water in ways that support a variety of high-value water uses, including human consumptive and non- consumptive uses as well as environmental needs.\n","3219:  Challenges and Pressures Water supply is a significant issue in many communities in BC and around the world.\n","3220:  Water supply is particularly important in regions where supplies may be limited, storage capacity is limited, and/or Climate Considerations Climate change is impacting, and will continue to impact, many aspects of water supply and management in BC.\n","3222:  These and other climate-related impacts should be addressed in plans that aim to consider medium to long-term pressures on water supply and demand.\n","3223:  The plans should develop solutions for dealing with those pressures.\n","3224:  See sections 3 and 9 of this guide for information, tools and resources about climate change impacts on water, related community vulnerabilities and risks, as well as considerations about how climate impacts can be managed through adaptation and water and watershed planning.\n","3225:  5.1 WAteR COnseRVA tiOn PlAns Water conservation planning is receiving more and more attention in BC.\n","3226:  There is a growing appreciation of the limited availability of water supplies, and an increasing concern about the impacts of climate change on water supply and demand.\n","3227:  Water conservation is one of the best mechanisms to manage water demand within existing supplies, and avoid the cost of developing additional supplies.\n","3229:  Conservation is particularly important in areas that are experiencing population growth, economic development and other changes that lead to increased demand for water.\n","3230:  Water conservation is important in areas where there may be a reduced water supply in the future as a result of climate change.\n","3232:  These plans extend beyond household water savings to include industrial, commercial, institutional and agricultural water users.\n","3234:  Water conservation plans can help communities manage the impacts of water shortages that are less severe than drought conditions.\n","3235:  These plans can also deliver benefits to communities that are not presently experiencing water shortages.\n","3236:  Through conservation, water suppliers can reduce the costs associated with developing new water supplies, drinking water treatment, drinking water distribution, wastewater treatment and associated pumping and energy costs.\n","3237:  provincial capital grant funding for drinking water and wastewater infrastructure.\n","3238:  Water conservation plans are typically developed at the geographic scale of a community or region.\n","3239:  It is important to consider all water users (residential, agricultural, industrial), all water supplies (surface and groundwater) and how these users and supplies interact with, and affect, each other.\n","3240:  Therefore, the use of a holistic approach or _watershed eye- view_ to water conservation planning is beneficial.\n","3241:  This translates into considering entire watersheds in the decision-making process, and integrating all aspects of water management into the plan.\n","3242:  Key Elements and Steps The following are some of the key elements and steps in preparing a Water Conservation Plan: _ Developing a comprehensive community water use profile that outlines the amounts of water used by different sectors (such as household, industrial, agricultural, municipal and other use); _ Forecasting future water supplies and demands; _ Developing a future vision of water use and supply for the community; _ Quantifying and understanding the impacts of different water conservation measures; and, _ Integrating the water conservation plan with other plans (e.g., Regional growth strategies, official community plans, land use plans, transportation plans, integrated community sustainability plans and watershed plans).\n","3243:  The POLIS Project on Ecological Governance is a BC-based organization that has undertaken significant research on water issues and has recently published a guide on water conservation planning.\n","3244:  Local governments in BC are now required to have water conservation plans to be eligible for POLIS characterizes a strong water conservation plan as having: 22 _ At least a 20_50 year time frame; _ A comprehensive and thoughtful rationale for water conservation; _ An integrated approach to water conservation, which is linked to other plans such as wastewater, land use, and asset management plans; and _ An effective implementation strategy.\n","3245:  POLIS characterizes an excellent water conservation plan, as one that goes further to: _ Place ecological health at its core; _ Be tailored to a community_s watershed context and consider the community_s impact on the watershed; _ Blend innovative legal tools such as water restrictions and land use planning bylaws with practical measures such as rebate and metering programs; _ Make managing demand a part of daily business rather than a stop-gap measure designed merely to buy time needed to increase supply; _ Build in measures that are geared towards rainwater capture and wastewater reclamation, reuse and recycling to better match water quality to end uses; _ Implement outreach and education programs that go beyond information dissemination to engage and inspire citizens to permanently change behaviour; and, _ Use a _triple bottom line_ approach to valuing water.\n","3246:  2 While it may not be possible or practical in all cases for communities to achieve these characteristics, it is important to consider them during the development and implementation of water conservation plans to ensure the plans are effective, comprehensive and successfully implemented.\n","3247:  5.2 dROuGht mAnAGement PlAns The Province of BC defines drought as a period of sustained low precipitation and high evaporation, resulting in low stream flows and groundwater levels, and water shortages.\n","3248:  Key Elements and Steps The Dealing With Drought Handbook _ published by the BC Ministry of Environment in 2004 and available online _ provides a common template for developing Drought Management Plans.\n","3249:  The following are some of the key elements and steps in preparing such a plan: _ Establish a local drought management team; _ Document the membership and operating procedures of the local drought management team.\n","3250:  _ Document the water system profile; _ Evaluate the potential impacts of drought on the region_s economy; _ Evaluate the potential impacts of drought on the social & environmental well-being of the region; _ Identify data requirements, frequency of data collection and reporting protocols on local water supplies and climate; _ Develop clear definitions of local drought stages and corresponding local responses; and _ Prepare communications plans.\n","3251:  The province of BC has established a Drought Management Framework _ refer to Drought Information, for information on: _ Drought Advisories; _ Levels of Water Shortages and Drought Conditions; _ The Provincial Drought Response; _ Individual Drought Response Measures; _ Resources; and _ Snow Surveys and Additional Important Info.\n","3252:  5.3 WAteR use PlAns When it comes to water planning and management, a wide variety of human uses and instream environmental needs must be considered and balanced.\n","3253:  Water use planning is one approach to achieving this balance for a specified watercourse, watershed and/ or water facility such as a reservoir.\n","3254:  To date, Water Use Plans (WUP) have for the most part been associated with waterpower licences that are held by BC Hydro.\n","3255:  The Comptroller of Water Rights or other appropriate authorities under the Water Act may require that a WUP be prepared for any existing licence.\n","3257:  WUPs may also be required for other water control facilities where there is an undesirable effect on fish, aquatic habitat, or other important values.\n","3258:  While WUPs for existing licences may be required as needs are identified, plans may also be required as a condition of proponents seeking new licences for larger-scale operations (industrial, agricultural, municipal, or other facilities), or for works located on particularly valuable or sensitive streams.\n","3259:  23 Significant drought is characterized by particularly low stream flows.\n","3260:  _In British Columbia, drought may be caused by combinations of insufficient snow accumulation, hot and dry weather or a delay in rainfall.\n","3261:  Hydrological drought is associated with the effect of low precipitation on water levels in rivers, reservoirs, lakes and aquifers.\n","3262:  Hydrological drought affects uses which depend on ground and surface water levels and stream flows._ _Living Water Smart 3 BC communities have experienced drought in the past and will continue to do so in the future.\n","3263:  Drought is a projected impact of climate change in BC so communities might experience more frequent or severe drought conditions than in the past.\n","3264:  Drought circumstances can have profound impacts on the socio-economic and environmental health of communities including agriculture and food.\n","3265:  Aquatic ecosystems and fisheries are also affected by drought conditions.\n","3266:  When water availability is very low, there can also be concerns about water quality, because pollution levels are relatively concentrated, and more bacteria can survive in warmer water.\n","3267:  Lower water availability can also lead to higher costs of water, and restrictions on water use.\n","3268:  Water use restrictions can in turn impact business operations, employment, personal use and tourism.\n","3269:  There is a strong rationale for undertaking a broad assessment and analysis of overall water allocation in a community or region to help inform the development and implementation of a Drought Management Plan.\n","3271:  Similar to water conservation plans, they focus on managing demand, reducing consumption and improving efficiency of water use.\n","3272:  Like conservation plans, effective drought management plans need to consider all water uses (including household, industrial, commercial, institutional and agricultural).\n","3274:  Drought management plans are typically developed at the community or regional scale.\n","3275:  It is important to consider all uses of a particular water supply such as a watershed or aquifer, and the interactions between water supplies.\n","3276:  A watershed-based approach is particularly relevant because a drought event typically affects a large area and all types of water supplies.\n","3277:  A key characteristic of drought management plans is that they identify drought stages and trigger appropriate response actions.\n","3278:  The Province of BC uses a four level drought classification (normal, dry, very dry and extremely dry) to describe the severity of drought conditions and appropriate levels of response.\n","3280:  Drought management plans should be developed before conditions require their use.\n","3281:  Because of the potentially severe socio-economic and environmental impacts of droughts, emotions can run very high during these events.\n","3282:  Therefore, planning well in advance of a drought will allow more time for thoughtful, rational and comprehensive planning than when a community is already experiencing a drought situation.\n","3283:  A proactive approach also enables farmers, ranchers, other businesses, institutions and households to assess the plans in advance of a drought and offer feedback.\n","3284:  These groups of stakeholders can also take measures to prepare for the challenges and opportunities associated with implementing drought management and water conservation measures.\n","3285:  Characteristics, Benefits and Applications A Water Use Plan is a formal agreement that clarifies how water will be shared among water licensees while still providing adequate flows for fish and wildlife.\n","3286:  A water licensee leads the planning process.\n","3287:  The overarching goal of a Water Use Plan is to find _a better balance between competing uses of water, such as domestic water supply, fish and wildlife, recreating, heritage and electrical power needs, which are environmentally, socially and economically acceptable to British Columbians_.\n","3288:  As such, Water Use Plans can help resolve conflicts among competing water users.\n","3289:  To be effective, the plans need to consider all water uses and water licencees within a specified watercourse or watershed, as well as instream flow requirements for fish and aquatic ecosystems.\n","3290:  A watershed-based approach is particularly relevant because it includes all water uses, including instream environmental flows.\n","3291:  The water use planning process has provided valuable information about environmental flow requirements in many of BC_s water systems.\n","3292:  Water Use Plans may result in an agreement to amend a water license, resulting in a change in legal rights.\n","3293:  They can also support water use regulation through voluntary changes to water use within existing water rights.\n","3294:  The Guidelines state that if there are financial impacts on the licensee related to a reduction in water rights, compensation for losses will be an important consideration.\n","3295:  The Water Use Plan process could be broadly applied to other licence holders in BC because it has shown _great promise in dealing with conflicts among owners of water licences and non-licenced users of water, such as fish and aquatic resources_.\n","3296:  Local and regional governments may also develop Water Use Plans.\n","3297:  For example, the District of Summerland in the Okanagan region used the water use planning process for Trout Creek (Summerland Water Use Plan).\n","3298:  _Metro is developing a Joint Water Use Plan for the Seymour and Capilano Watersheds.\n","3299:  This Water Use Plan is about how the reservoirs and dams are operated, how water is released from the reservoirs and how it is allocated (as examples: drinking water, fisheries habitat, proposed power generation)...\n","3300:  The planning process will explore whether and how hydropower generation from existing reservoirs can be accommodated within Metro Vancouver_s commitment to: continue to supply clean, safe drinking water, protect fish habitat, adapt to climate variability and climate change.\n","3301:  Other community interests such as recreation, culture and heritage, and safety, will be reviewed within the context of the planning process._ (Metro Vancouver Water Use Plan).\n","3302:  To date, all Water Use Plans have been prepared for surface water resources.\n","3303:  This type of planning process is unlikely to be applicable to groundwater resources within current contexts.\n","3304:  Although the Water Act vests ownership of both surface and groundwater to the province of British Columbia, the Act does not require a licence to withdraw and use subsurface water.\n","3305:  However, groundwater regulation is within the scope of the Water Act Modernization initiative.\n","3306:  Assessing the role of groundwater resources in maintaining instream flows and related surface water values is extremely complicated.\n","3307:  Therefore, Water Use Plans may be an inappropriate or impractical approach to planning for groundwater resources at this time.\n","3308:  However, some of the other characteristics and benefits of Water Use Plans could potentially be adapted to plan for and manage groundwater resources.\n","3309:  Facilitating collaborative, multi-sector planning to achieve a balance across multiple water users and management goals is a key attribute of Water Use Plans that could be adapted to groundwater strategies.\n","3310:  As of 2010, 24 Water Use Plans had been completed for BC Hydro facilities.\n","3311:  For more information on these plans see: Water Use Planning or BC Hydro Water Use Planning www.bchydro.com/planning_ regulatory/water_use_planning.html?WT.mc_id=rd_wup.\n","3312:  Key Elements and Steps The following are some of the key elements and steps in preparing a Water Use Plan: 24 _ Develop the plan in accordance with the provincial water use plan guidelines; _ Ensure the plan is consistent with the water act and the fisheries act; _ Develop the plan through an inclusive, consultative, multi-stakeholder planning process associated with a water act licence, and include local, provincial, federal and first nations governments, local citizens, industrial users, water licence holders and other interest groups; _ Undertake hydrological studies, modeling, and assessments of instream flow requirements to develop a water budget that characterizes water supply and demand within the planning area; _ Define the proposed operating parameters to be applied in the day- to-day operations of hydroelectric or other water storage facilities; _ Under the water act the comptroller_s responsibility relates to amending waterpower licences and issuing orders to help implement: _operational changes, monitoring studies and physical works outlined in the plan_; and, _ Implement the plan in accordance with conditions stated in the water licence renewal or amendment, or through an engineers_ orders under the water act.\n","3313:  5.4 WAteR AllOCA tiOn PlAns When planning for water allocation, a wide variety of human and ecosystem needs must be identified and balanced.\n","3314:  Water allocation planning is an approach to achieving this balance in the future for a specified watershed or for a large water source.\n","3315:  For example the Lemieux Creek Water Availability Report - 2004 is a water availability study that is used to some extent as a WAP.\n","3316:  It is very important to undertake this type of planning before a watershed approaches its limits of available supply relative to future demands, and before drought or other extreme conditions threaten good relationships between stakeholders.\n","3317:  Water Allocation Plans were first developed on Vancouver Island, as a means to facilitate making water allocation decisions by the Regional Water Manager under the Water Act.\n","3318:  WAPs for other regions of the province may follow.\n","3319:  See Water Allocation Plans.\n","3320:  Characteristics, Benefits and Applications The Ministry of Forests, Lands and Natural Resource Operations (MFLNRO) may lead or provide assistance to the WAP planning process.\n","3321:  The plan allows for information about the Ministry_s position on water allocation decisions to be made available to future water license applicants and the public.\n","3322:  By providing greater clarity, consistency and transparency regarding water allocation decisions, Water Allocation Plans can help avoid or reduce potential conflicts related to future water licence applications.\n","3323:  in the Southern Interior.\n","3324:  To view a list or to access the plans, visit www.env.gov.bc.ca/wsd/water_rights/wap/index.html.\n","3325:  Water Allocation Plans are considered regional policy, and the MFLNRO uses these plans while exercising its authority (e.g.\n","3326:  issuing water licences) under the Water Act.\n","3328:  Where developed, these plans have improved the efficiency of making water allocation decisions while protecting environmental flows.\n","3329:  The plans have also assisted government agencies and water licence applicants as they ensure that their applications and actions align with environmental laws.\n","3330:  The Shawnigan-Goldstream Water Allocation Plan describes these plans as _a means of anticipating and planning for water uses, identifying water demands and ensuring that water use is compatible with the goals of a sustainable environment.\n","3332:  One water availability study (to inform water allocation decisions) has also been completed for a water source To date, all Water Allocation Plans have been prepared for surface water resources.\n","3333:  As with water use plans, WAPs are unlikely to be applicable to groundwater resources because of the complexity of groundwater resources and because the Water Act does not presently require a licence to withdraw and use subsurface water.\n","3334:  Therefore, Water Allocation Plans may be an inappropriate or impractical approach to planning for groundwater resources.\n","3335:  However, some of the characteristics and benefits of Water Allocation Plans, such as area-based planning and consideration of future water demand, can be adapted to plan for and manage the allocation of groundwater resources.\n","3336:  In addition, groundwater regulation is within the scope of the Water Act Modernization initiative.\n","3337:  Key Elements and Steps The following are some of the key elements and steps in preparing a Water Allocation Plan: _ Planning is initiated by the regional water manager (or equivalent) of the ministry of forests, lands and natural resource operations; _ The planning process is led by ministry staff when a business case has been established that demonstrates efficiencies in making water licence and allocation decisions; _ Assessments are conducted on a watershed basis to identify the available surface water resources, instream flow requirements for fish, existing and potential licensable water demands, and to provide direction regarding future water licence allocations; _ Significant resources may be invested in gathering required water flow information, undertaking assessments, and working with agencies and stakeholders to develop the plan; _ The WAP is submitted to the regional water manager for approval; _ The WAP becomes regional policy upon signature by the regional water manager; and _ The WAP is reviewed when the regional water manager feels that it is appropriate to update or amend the plan.\n","3338:  5.5 RefeRenCes 1 Brandes, O.M., 2005.\n","3339:  \"At a Watershed: Ecological Governance

 Protecting drinking Water Quality Drinking water in BC communities comes from a variety of surface and groundwater sources.\n","3373:  wastewater discharges from sewage treatment, commercial and industrial facilities) and non- point sources (e.g.\n","3374:  runoff from urban development, agriculture, forestry and other land uses) of pollution.\n","3375:  Natural processes, such as flooding, landslides, erosion and sediment transport can also impact water quality with turbidity and water-borne pathogens (such as E. coli, Cryptosporidium, and Giardia).\n","3376:  It is also important to consider the impacts of climate change when planning and managing for drinking water in BC.\n","3377:  Healthy watersheds can contribute significantly to clean surface and groundwater sources because healthy watersheds purify water, and vegetated riparian areas filter and process pollutants such as heavy metals, oils, sediment and waste products.\n","3378:  Aquatic ecosystems, such as wetlands and rivers, filter water, allow for the deposition of suspended sediments and provide extra storage capacity in times of high precipitation.\n","3379:  Natural states of land cover, such as forest ecosystems, also help to naturally manage stormwater runoff and reduce flooding risks, and provide important habitat for fish and wildlife.\n","3380:  When the health and functionality of a watershed is compromised by human intervention, changes to water quality can occur and additional planning and management may be needed.\n","3381:  The primary responsibilities for protecting water quality are shared by all orders of government including federal (departments of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development, Environment, and Fisheries and Oceans), provincial (ministries of Health and Environment), regional health authorities, First Nations, municipalities, regional districts, other water suppliers.\n","3382:  When you consider the variety of pressures on water quality, we all have roles in the protection of water quality.\n","3383:  The roles and responsibilities for drinking water treatment vary across the province, but lie primarily with municipalities, regional districts, or other water suppliers, with oversight by the BC Ministry of Health and Regional Health Authorities.\n","3384:  Types of Planning for Protecting Drinking Water Quality This section of the guide profiles three specific types of plans: _ Well (Aquifer) Protection Plans _ Source Water Assessments and Assessment Response Plans _ Drinking Water Protection Plans 26 Three types of plans may be developed to assist with the protection of water quality in British Columbia.\n","3385:  Drinking Water Protection Plans are established under the provincial Drinking Water Protection Act by the government to prevent a substantial threat to water supplies that would result in a health hazard.\n","3386:  Also under the Drinking Water Protection Act, an Assessment Response Plan can be required if a Drinking Water Officer, orders a water supplier to prepare an assessment where potential threats to water quality have been identified, that might adversely impact water supply.\n","3387:  Well Protection Plans, which may also be a requirement under the Drinking Water Protection Act, are developed to minimize impacts of land use activities on groundwater supplies that are used by community wells.\n","3388:  Well Protection Plans can be expanded to the protection of entire aquifers, or perhaps multiple aquifers.\n","3389:  For this reason, these plans are referred to as Well (Aquifer) Protection Plans in this guide.\n","3390:  Section 7 of the guide explores the scope and value of water, watershed and storm water management plans, which are also relevant to the protection of water quality.\n","3391:  Why Plan for Protecting Drinking Water Quality?\n","3392:  In anticipation of and/or response to mounting challenges, pressures and changes in their watersheds, it is important for BC communities to plan for protection of their drinking water.\n","3393:  Water planning can help BC communities understand and address current and expected challenges by improving knowledge about threats to water quality.\n","3394:  Protecting source water and drinking water quality is primarily about ensuring that point and non-point sources of pollution do not adversely impact water for human consumption.\n","3395:  Source water includes surface waters, aquifers, or groundwater recharge areas.\n","3396:  For an overview of roles and responsibilities for the protection of drinking water quality see the Ministry of Health website for Drinking Water Quality.\n","3397:  Considerable time, money and effort go into treating water and wastewater to protect water quality for various uses.\n","3398:  Recently, attention has turned to the importance of protecting water sources as a fundamental approach to managing water quality.\n","3399:  Source water protection seeks to identify means of preventing, minimizing, or controlling potential sources of water pollution.\n","3400:  It is the first step in a multi-barrier approach to drinking water protection, which provides benefits on a watershed scale by protecting public health, ecosystem functions, and a variety of social, economic, cultural and spiritual values.\n","3401:  Figure 2 illustrates different components of a multi-barrier approach to protecting drinking water.\n","3403:  127 Legislature & policy frameworks G IN R O T I N O M Source water protection Public involvement & awareness Clean, safe, reliable drinking water Drinking water distribution system Research, science & technology Drinking water treatment M A N A G E M E NT Guidelines, standards & objectives Figure 2.\n","3404:  Components of a Multi-barrier Approach to Drinking Water Protection.\n","3405:  1 In many cases other water uses, such as those related to agricultural, commercial, institutional and industrial operations, are connected to drinking water supplies.\n","3406:  In addition, there are many ecological, recreational and other non-consumptive water uses that must be managed along with drinking water supplies.\n","3407:  Often, protecting drinking water can have important co-benefits related to environmental, cultural, spiritual and aesthetic values.\n","3408:  Desired outcomes of water quality planning may include: _ Ensuring a safe, secure supply of quality water for a wide variety of uses; _ Ensuring that water supply is robust and resilient to climate change impacts and other factors; _ Managing wastewater discharges to be within the capacity of receiving waters to absorb and assimilate wastes; _ Managing land and resource development practices (and day to day human activities) in ways that maintain and protect water quality; _ Practicing urban and rural development in ways that do not adversely affect natural processes (e.g.\n","3409:  Leaving floodplains in natural states and promoting natural functions such as sediment transport); and _ Raising public awareness of the value and importance of fresh water.\n","3412:  The province has established 467 CWs in response to the Forest and Range Practices Act, (Government Action Regulation) which provides an added level of protection for water quality in association with forestry operations.\n","3413:  However, more research may be required to determine whether there are CWs with completed watershed plans, or there is a desire, capacity and benefits associated with watershed planning at this scale.\n","3414:  28 Challenges and Pressures Water quality is a significant issue in some communities, particularly where there are threats to, or pressures on, community water supplies.\n","3415:  In some regions in BC drinking water treatment capacity is limited due to supply issues, and the health of aquatic ecosystems is threatened by point or non-point sources of pollution.\n","3416:  For some local governments meeting provincial drinking water standards is a challenge.\n","3417:  All BC Health Authorities are required to meet or exceed the Guidelines for Canadian Drinking Water Quality.\n","3418:  The Vancouver Island Health Authority developed its own interpretation of the guidelines with the introduction of the 4-3-2-1 Initiative.\n","3419:  This initiative is now used by Health Authorities across BC to ensure compliance.\n","3420:  In some communities, compliance with the guidelines will require the installation of new treatment plants, which can be a considerable added cost.\n","3421:  Because the pressures on water quality are so diverse, ultimately it is everyone_s responsibility to take care of our water resources, including protection of water quality at the source.\n","3422:  Boil Water Advisories Boil water advisories are issued to residents and other water users when a drinking water source is contaminated or there is a known risk of contamination.\n","3424:  Therefore, the number of boil water advisories issued reflects both the quality of drinking water sources in the area and the adequacy of treatment systems to provide clean water.\n","3425:  Over the past decade, the number of boil water advisories in BC has increased.\n","3426:  This may be due to several reasons related to actual deterioration of water quality, or greater focus on monitoring and attention to risk.\n","3427:  In 2008, the BC Ministry of Health documented 530 boil water advisories.\n","3428:  Most of those advisories were on smaller water systems that were serving between 15 and 5000 people.\n","3429:  2 Land Use and Non-Point Sources of Pollution Urban, industrial and agricultural activities can pose serious threats to water quality.\n","3430:  These land uses are associated with a variety of pollutants including nitrates from manure and synthetic fertilizers applied to agricultural lands, sedimentation from eroding soils and stream banks through urban development, and toxic chemicals from a variety of industrial, commercial and household sources.\n","3431:  Development activities near shallow wells or above unconfined aquifers (e.g.\n","3432:  aquifers that do not have an impermeable layer above them to protect the water from surface pollutants), increase the risk of contamination, and are of particular concern.\n","3433:  Vulnerable Aquifers Presently, no permits are required to drill a well or extract well water in BC.\n","3434:  This lack of groundwater regulation is a key challenge; however, this may change with modernization of the Water Act.\n","3435:  Drinking water quality concerns may be elevated in communities that rely primarily on groundwater sources.\n","3436:  This is because groundwater sources are difficult to clean once contaminated, contamination can more easily occur without anyone knowing about it, and because they require more time for natural recycling and replacement of water than do surface water sources.\n","3437:  Therefore, once water quality is degraded, it takes much longer for contaminants to be diluted or removed.\n","3438:  This is a concern to communities such as Langley BC, which sources 80% of its drinking water from wells.\n","3439:  Source Protection and Upstream Activities In many cases, resource-related activities on private and Crown lands, such as forestry, ranching, agriculture and mining, can effect nearby or downstream community water supplies.\n","3440:  Often these activities take place _upstream_ of community water supplies, and may be outside of the jurisdiction of local or regional governments.\n","3441:  Typically, local governments do not have the authority to regulate or stop these resource practices.\n","3442:  There is also a limitation of government authority when it comes to agriculture even within local government boundaries.\n","3443:  For example, farm bylaws require approval by the Province of BC before coming into effect.\n","3444:  Climate Considerations Climate change is impacting, and will continue to impact, water quality through a variety of mechanisms throughout BC.\n","3445:  Increased frequency and severity of drought and flood events, low summer flows, warmer freshwater temperatures, reduced dilution / assimilative capacity, and increased erosion, turbidity and sedimentation are just a few examples.\n","3446:  These and other climate-related impacts should be addressed in plans that consider medium to long- term pressures on water quality.\n","3447:  The plans should develop solutions for dealing with those pressures.\n","3448:  See sections 3 and 9 of this guide for information, tools and resources about climate change impacts on water, related community vulnerabilities and risks, as well as considerations about how climate impacts can be managed through water and watershed planning as well as adaptation.\n","3449:  6.1 Well (AQuifeR) PROteCtiOn PlAns Well Protection Plans can be developed to provide protective measures for minimizing and preventing undesirable impacts from land use activities on subsurface community water sources.\n","3450:  Many wells that provide water to communities or municipalities are located in areas where human activities can affect water quality.\n","3451:  The impact is most severe where these _community wells_ draw water from shallow aquifers that are vulnerable to contamination from land use activities and non-point sources of pollution.\n","3452:  Protecting source water through a well protection plan is one of the steps in the multi-barrier approach to drinking water protection.\n","3453:  Approximately 40 Well Protection Plans have been established in BC.\n","3454:  The Ministry of Environment is the lead agency for the Well Protection Toolkit.\n","3455:  Characteristics, Benefits and Applications Well or aquifer protection plans focus on protecting groundwater quality from potential pollution sources.\n","3456:  These sources of pollution may come from the land above or near to the aquifer or well, or they may infiltrate into the groundwater source from elsewhere.\n","3459:  In BC, Well Protection Plans may be required under the following circumstances: _ By health authorities when they review an operating permit for a large drinking water system that includes wells; _ By the provincial government as a condition of granting infrastructure funding for new municipal/regional district wells; and, _ As a condition of a provincial environmental assessment for proposed large withdrawals.3 Well protection plans are developed for an area that includes the recharge area for a well or aquifer.\n","3460:  It is important to consider all land uses and associated threats to groundwater quality.\n","3461:  Therefore, the use of a holistic approach to planning is encouraged.\n","3462:  A more holistic approach may aim to address multiple aquifers within a region or community and it may also aim to address both quality and quantity issues.\n","3463:  Depending on the water and land use pressures, and water-related vulnerabilities, a more comprehensive Groundwater Management Plan may be appropriate in some areas.\n","3464:  29 Key Elements and Steps In partnership with the BC Ground Water Association, the Province of BC published the Well Protection Toolkit, which was updated in 2006.\n","3465:  Over the last five years, communities in BC have been using the toolkit to develop protection plans for their wells and aquifers, and to prevent contamination of their groundwater supply.\n","3466:  The toolkit presents a six-step approach to developing and implementing a protection plan to prevent well water contamination.\n","3468:  Form a community planning team; 2.\n","3469:  Define the capture zone (recharge area) of the community well or aquifer; 3.\n","3470:  Map potential sources of pollution in the capture zone; 4.\n","3471:  Develop and implement protection measures to prevent pollution; 5.\n","3472:  Develop a contingency plan for any accidents; and 6.\n","3473:  Monitor, evaluate and report on the plan annually.\n","3474:  These six steps can be incorporated as a policy commitment into Official Community Plans or as part of Water Management Plans.4 However, there is some uncertainty about the authority of local governments to invoke the protection measures referred to above, as well as the resource capacity to enforce these protection measures.\n","3475:  6.2 sOuRCe W AteR Assessments & Assessment ResPOnse PlAns Drinking water source and system assessments are a critical starting point for drinking water protection, and are integral to understanding the state of BC_s drinking water supplies, and what needs to be done to improve them.\n","3476:  Water providers often do not have any control over land uses in the watersheds from which they get their drinking water.\n","3477:  They may not be aware of natural conditions or human activities within a watershed that affect surface and subsurface water quality.\n","3478:  Proper assessments can help identify opportunities for preventative or remedial action, and give both the water providers and their customers confidence that source protection is a management priority in the region.\n","3479:  Under Part 3 of the Drinking Water Protection Act, a drinking water protection officer may order a water supplier to complete a water source and system assessment.\n","3480:  The purpose of the assessment is to: _ Assess the drinking water source in relation to land uses within the watershed and activities that may affect the source; _ Inventory the water supply system, including treatment options and operational procedures; _ Assess the monitoring requirements for the drinking water source and water supply system; and; _ Identify current and potential future threats to drinking water.\n","3481:  The Ministry of Health has produced both the Source to Tap Screening Tool, which can be used to used as a secondary method for assessing risk in drinking water systems, and the Comprehensive Drinking Water Source-to-Tap Assessment Guideline, which serves as a tool to help water system managers develop a better understanding of the risks to drinking water safety and availability.\n","3482:  The guideline provides a structured and consistent approach to evaluating and managing risks to drinking water.\n","3484:  6 Characteristics, Benefits and Applications After reviewing a completed source and system assessment, a drinking water protection officer may order a water supplier to complete an Assessment Response Plan, as outlined under Section 22 of the Drinking Water Protection Act.\n","3485:  These plans are intended to identify measures that can be taken to address identified threats to drinking water.\n","3486:  Currently, the regulations do not state when source water assessments will be required; however, the Drinking Water Officer_s Guide outlines some of the conditions under which an assessment may be required.\n","3487:  It is not yet clear what role, if any, the public will have in this process.\n","3488:  Key Elements and Steps Assessment Response Plans are intended to identify reasonable measures that can be taken to address threats to drinking water, as identified in a Source Water Assessment.\n","3490:  The plans are typically developed for a specific source of drinking water supply, such as a watercourse, watershed, reservoir or aquifer.\n","3491:  Therefore, they are relevant to area-based planning for both surface water (watersheds) and groundwater (aquifers), where the threats to water quality and quantity are dispersed across a wide landscape.\n","3492:  Within these plans, it is important to consider all potential threats to the water source; therefore, a watershed-based approach _ at the appropriate scale _ is particularly relevant.\n","3493:  As of 2011, no DWPPs had been completed or designated in BC.\n","3494:  They are considered to be a last resort because of the stringent requirements associated with them, and should only be considered where it can be established that regulatory tools are required to achieve the planning objectives.\n","3495:  DWPPs should only be required when other plans fail to address or prevent a threat to drinking water.\n","3496:  However, there are circumstances where threats to drinking water could lead to negative consequences (such as a health hazard) where no other measures under the Drinking Water Protection Act would prevent the health hazard from occurring.\n","3497:  Characteristics, Benefits and Applications DWPPs are authorized under Part 5 of the Drinking Water Protection Act and are intended to address concerns about water quantity and water quality.\n","3498:  Based on the recommendation of a drinking water protection officer, the Provincial Health Officer may recommend that the Minister of Health designate an area for a DWPP.\n","3500:  These may include strategic, operational, land use or water use plans; _ Preparation of the plans must include an extensive public consultation process; _ The plans are subject to review by the provincial Cabinet and approval by an order of the provincial Cabinet; _ Water suppliers are legally responsible for putting the plans into action; and _ They are implemented through regulatory actions, which are legally enforceable.\n","3501:  water protection officers are required to consider all other options available under the Drinking Water Protection Act before asking the Provincial Health Officer to consider recommending a plan.\n","3502:  To date, no plans have been completed.\n","3503:  However, the creation of a Drinking Water Protection Plan has been under consideration for the Comox Valley on Vancouver Island for the past two years.\n","3504:  For such plans to be authorized, there would have to be significant impairments to source waters, and an associated health hazard to trigger a planning effort.\n","3506:  They can consider threats to water sources, different methods of treatment, and all matters related to the delivery of safe drinking water.\n","3508:  Because there is potential for the two types of plans to overlap, the Drinking Water Protection Act and Water Act state that if both types are to be initiated within one particular area, they can be developed jointly.\n","3509:  3 Key Elements and Steps Drinking Water Protection Plans are issued by the provincial government (the Lieutenant Governor with advice from Cabinet) to do one or more of the following: a) Require other specified provincial government or local authority strategic or operational planning processes, or classes of such processes, to consider the DWPP; b) Require the results of specified provincial government or local authority strategic or operational planning processes, or classes of such processes, to be consistent with the DWPP; c) Provide that specified provincial government or local authority strategic or operational plans, bylaws, or other planning documents, or classes of such plans, bylaws, or other documents do not have legal effect to the extent of any inconsistency with the DWPP; and d) A provision under subsection (1) c) applies despite any other enactment.\n","3510:  6.4 RefeRenCes 1 Okanagan Water Stewardship Council

full spectrum of water and watershed issues and explore the value of adopting an integrated approach to planning and management.\n","3538:  The context for integrated planning includes the breadth of issues that were raised in sections 5 (water supply and demand) and 6 (protecting drinking water quality).\n","3539:  In addition, integrated watershed planning considers issues related to watershed functions, ecosystem health, connections between land use and water, as well as water quality within lakes, rivers and streams.\n","3541:  It is also becoming increasingly important to consider the impacts of climate change when developing planning processes, implementing those plans and making water management decisions.\n","3543:  When the natural functioning of a watershed is compromised by human activities, integrated approaches to water and watershed planning can be helpful, and may well be necessary.\n","3544:  The responsibilities for protecting watershed health and the interconnections between water quantity and quality are widely distributed among federal, provincial, First Nations, and local governments, and other organizations.\n","3545:  In many BC communities, the challenge of navigating highly complex water and land use issues is pointing to the need for an integrated and collaborative approach to watershed planning and governance.\n","3546:  Integrated planning involves a broad-based analysis of local and regional water quantity, water quality and other watershed issues, as well as the interconnections between these issues.\n","3547:  Types of Integrated Water & Watershed Planning The following planning processes encourage more integrated and holistic approaches and can help to address a variety of water supply, demand, and quality issues, and include: _ Water Management Plans (Water Act, Part 4) _ Watershed Management Plans _ Stormwater (Rainwater) Management Plans 32 Why Undertake Integrated Planning for Water, Land and Watersheds BC communities are undertaking integrated watershed planning and are adopting a wide range of strategies to manage a multitude of current and future challenges, pressures and changes in watersheds.\n","3548:  Many of these pressures may be effectively addressed within plans that recognize the interconnections within a watershed system, including: _ surface water and groundwater connections; _ water quantity and quality connections; _ land and water connections; and _ community and watershed connections.\n","3549:  Watershed planning can help BC communities understand and address these challenges by improving knowledge about the current and future threats to water quantity and quality for human and environmental uses, and threats to overall watershed health and community sustainability.\n","3550:  The desired outcomes of integrated planning for water, land and watersheds may include: _ Managing water uses and rates of consumption within available water supplies seasonally, annually and over the long term; _ Developing and managing water supplies in ways that do not compromise the health and biodiversity of fish, wildlife, ecosystems and watersheds; _ Managing the allocation of water in ways that support a variety of high-value water uses, including human consumptive and non-consumptive uses as well as instream environmental uses; _ Ensuring a safe, secure supply of water for a wide variety of uses; _ Managing wastewater discharges within the capacity of receiving waters to absorb and assimilate those wastes; _ Managing land development and resource management practices (and day to day human activities) in ways that do not adversely impact water quality; _ Managing human development patterns in ways that stabilize rather than destabilize the hydrologic cycle; _ Managing human development patterns in ways that reduce rather than increase the vulnerability of communities to water-related hazards, such as flooding and erosion; and, _ Maintaining and strengthening community resiliency by preparing for climate change and its impacts on water and aquatic ecosystems.\n","3551:  Challenges and Pressures Integrated water and watershed planning is important in communities, particularly where there are multiple threats to, or pressures on, the quantity and/or quality of community water supplies, where infrastructure capacity is limited in relation to those threats, and where the health of aquatic ecosystems is threatened by multiple pressures on water quality or quantity.\n","3552:  Depending on the community or region of the province, and on land and resource uses, climate change impacts and planning can influence these issues in a variety of ways.\n","3554:  Growing Demands on Limited Water Supplies A variety of land and water uses can impact water supply and demand, stream hydrology, groundwater tables, surface and groundwater quality, and the overall health of watersheds.\n","3555:  For example, in the Township of Langley, multiple community wells and private wells withdraw water from the same aquifer.\n","3556:  Managing demand within the available supply requires an integrated approach to understand the complexity of the challenges associated with water use and groundwater recharge, particularly in relation to population growth, economic development and climate change impacts.\n","3557:  Changes in Land Use and Land Cover In many communities across BC, changes in land cover due to activities such as forestry, and increased imperviousness as a result of urban development can result in more _flashy_ stream and river hydrology and increased rates of erosion and sediment transport.\n","3558:  For example, in watersheds with reduced forest cover or increased impervious surfaces, a greater proportion of rainfall quickly enters storm sewers, drainage ditches and streams, resulting in high peak flows and less groundwater infiltration.\n","3559:  In the Central Interior of BC, the mountain pine beetle (MPB) outbreak has resulted in many dead, standing trees, significant salvage logging, and forest fires, all of which have dramatically impacted hydrology, erosion and sedimentation, aquatic habitat, and overall watershed health.\n","3561:  Historically, cold winters have kept mountain pine beetle populations in check in BC, thereby preventing a significant outbreak.\n","3562:  Over the long term, forest cover may return to more natural conditions and watershed health may recover; however, in the interim, communities may need to manage the impacts associated with these pressures.\n","3563:  In the case of urban development, human intervention may be required to restore watershed health.\n","3564:  With respect to the effects of BC_s MPB infestation on hydrology note the 2008 Ministry of Environment report: Mountain Pine Beetle Infestation: Hydrological Impacts.\n","3565:  Climate Considerations Climate change is impacting, and will continue to impact, many aspects of water, land and watersheds in BC.\n","3567:  These and other climate-related impacts should be addressed in plans that aim to consider medium to long-term pressures on water quantity, quality, and ecosystem health.\n","3568:  The plans should develop solutions for dealing with those pressures.\n","3569:  See sections 3 and 9 of this guide for information, tools and resources about climate change impacts on water, related community vulnerabilities and risks, as well as 33 considerations about how climate impacts can be managed through adaptation and water and watershed planning.\n","3570:  The need for a watershed approach is made even more evident when compounded by current and expected impacts of climate change.\n","3571:  For example, the Okanagan, Thompson and Cariboo- Chilcotin regions can expect hotter, drier summers; extended growing seasons with the potential for new crop production; and increased demand for irrigation and livestock watering.\n","3572:  Because this will occur when stream flows are at their lowest and when fish are particularly vulnerable, this may lead to increased levels of conflict among water users.\n","3573:  Because all three planning processes profiled in this section (water management, watershed management and stormwater management) may consider existing and future watershed processes and functions, they provide opportunities to consider climate change and its impacts, as well as other pressures, on watershed health.\n","3574:  It should be noted that although this guide focuses on planning and climate change adaptation for water and watersheds, climate change impacts will undoubtedly have a variety of other impacts on terrestrial ecosystems such as forests, grasslands and alpine ecosystems.\n","3575:  These impacts on the landscape will, in turn, influence the health of watersheds.\n","3576:  However, these land-based climate impacts are beyond the scope of this guide.\n","3577:  7.1 WAteR mAnAGement PlAns (WAteR ACt _ P ARt 4) Water Management Plans, which were introduced under Part 4 of the Water Act in 2004, involve a comprehensive and integrated approach to water and watershed planning.\n","3578:  This planning process is enabled only if the Minister of Environment determines that such a plan will help resolve conflicts between water users, conflicts between users and instream flow needs, or risks to water quality.\n","3579:  Although the Township of Langley has completed the draft of a WMP, to date there are no approved WMPs in effect in British Columbia.\n","3580:  Therefore, the operational compatibility of this planning tool with other Acts and regulations cannot be fully determined, nor can its effectiveness in improving water quality.\n","3581:  However, it has been suggested that Water Management Plans hold potential as a mechanism for protecting groundwater, as well as for establishing authority for source water protection.\n","3582:  Unlike other water planning tools, when Water Management Plans are implemented, they can place restrictions on the drilling or alteration of groundwater wells and the installation of well pumps.\n","3583:  The plans may also affect other statutory decisions.\n","3584:  However, there may be exceptions where the application of a WMP could be limited such as the Forest Act, Range Act, Forest Practices Code of BC Act, and the Forest and Range Practices Act.\n","3585:  1, 2 Water Management Plans may provide a good structure for developing valley-wide response plans for severe water shortages because they provide more authority to bring water licence holders to the table and hold them to the agreements that have been developed.\n","3586:  The plans may also be useful for providing water managers with tools to reduce activities and development in watersheds, thereby addressing the common challenge of managing water resources on private as well as Crown lands.\n","3587:  In 2009, the Township of Langley submitted a Water Management Plan: Final Report to the Minister of Environment for review.\n","3588:  As of 2011, TOL is the only local government that has been designated by the Minister of Environment to do so.\n","3590:  In this regard, they are relevant for source water protection and for managing demand in relation to water supply.\n","3591:  They may also be relevant to both surface water and groundwater sources.\n","3593:  They apply to a designated water management plan area where the water interests are dispersed across a wide landscape and where many water licensees, groundwater users and land-based activities may be included in the plan.\n","3594:  A Water Management Plan could apply to a watershed, aquifer, or another regional scale that is relevant to managing the water resources of a particular community.\n","3595:  Water Management Plans should be considered where regulatory tools are required and will provide an opportunity to achieve the planning objectives.\n","3596:  Upon completion and approval by the provincial Cabinet, Water Management Plans are legally enforceable.\n","3597:  However, significant resources may be required to develop and implement this type of plan.\n","3598:  Therefore, this approach to planning may not be feasible for some communities.\n","3600:  Because there is potential for the two types of plans to overlap, the Drinking Water Protection Act and Water Act state that if both types are to be initiated within one particular area, they can be developed jointly.\n","3601:  Key Elements and Steps The following are some of the key elements and steps in preparing a Water Management Plan: _ The plans are requested by letter to the regional water manager or to the comptroller of water rights; _ The plans require an assessment of preparedness among stakeholders, first nations and the province; _ The plans are initiated & have their terms of reference established by an order of the minister; _ The plans are required to consider existing provincial or local government strategic, operational, and land use or water use planning processes; _ Preparation of the plans must include an extensive public consultation process; _ Consideration must be given to the results or progress of provincial or local government strategic, operational and land use or water use planning processes within the designated area; _ The plans require approval by an order from the provincial cabinet to acquire official status; _ The plans are brought into effect by the creation of a regulation that is designed to implement the plan, approved by the provincial government by the lieutenant governor with advice from cabinet; and, _ The plans are implemented through regulation (the plan implementation regulation) issued by the lieutenant governor in council.\n","3602:  7.2 WAteRshed mAnAGement PlAns A watershed planning approach is a flexible framework for managing water resource quality and quantity within a specific drainage area, or watershed.\n","3603:  The approach includes stakeholder involvement and management actions that are supported by sound science and technology.\n","3604:  The watershed planning process works within this framework by drawing on a series of collaborative, iterative steps to characterize existing conditions, identify and prioritize problems, define management objectives, develop protection or remediation strategies, and implement and adapt selected actions when necessary.\n","3605:  The outcome of this process is a watershed plan, which is a strategy that assesses the state of a watershed and presents detailed management information in terms of analyses, actions, participants and resources required for developing and implementing the plan.\n","3606:  Using a watershed approach is considered beneficial because it addresses problems within a watershed in a holistic manner and actively involves stakeholders in identifying management strategies.\n","3607:  34 BC has no formal requirements or stipulations for undertaking watershed planning processes beyond the provisions under the Water Act to develop a WMP, with approval from the provincial government.\n","3608:  There is no standard template to follow.\n","3609:  Nonetheless, many communities across the province have taken the initiative to complete watershed management plans by developing their own approach to address key concerns in their respective watersheds.\n","3610:  Characteristics, Benefits and Applications Every watershed is unique in terms of its features, and every watershed planning process is unique in terms of the issues being addressed and the people involved.\n","3611:  Across the province, watershed management plans take different names and different forms, including watershed strategies, watershed blueprints, watershed recovery plans and water use management plans.\n","3612:  Despite these differences, several traits are shared by most watershed planning processes.\n","3613:  Typically, watershed planning is: _ An iterative and adaptive process; _ A holistic process; _ Geographically defined; _ Integrated with other planning processes; and _ A collaborative and participatory process.\n","3616:  Key Elements and Steps There is no absolute template to follow for watershed planning.\n","3617:  Every planning process and every plan is different.\n","3618:  However, many elements are critical to the success of watershed plans.\n","3620:  The relevant decision makers must be willing to consider implementing the plan; _ Ensure full representation of all affected parties, while keeping the size of the process workable; _ Ensure that the planning process is understood, used and broadly supported; _ Provide access to appropriate technical and analytical skills and information resources; _ Obtain sustainable funding; _ Ensure planning is done before further development activities (e.g.\n","3621:  urban development) will undermine the effectiveness of the plan; _ Factor in the impacts on future water inflows and recharge of climate change and activities and physical works that intercept water (e.g., farm dams and forestry); _ Include inputs from socio-economic analyses and incorporate consultation to improve the quality of decisions and build community confidence in the fairness of outcomes; _ Ensure that the values and interests of indigenous peoples are considered; _ Evelop capacity for learning and improving plans over time and the ability to evaluate the process; _ Provide adequate resources to develop and implement water plans and evaluate their outcomes; and, _ Improve monitoring and compliance of water use.\n","3622:  Ideally, watershed plans and the organizations involved in implementing the plans should emerge from the planning process with: _ improved understanding of the watershed and how it functions; _ clear objectives of how to manage the watershed sustainably and in an integrated manner; _ clearly specified community and environmental outcomes; _ decisions that are based on the best available information; _ adequately resourced management and implementation; and _ good integration with other regional and resource-based plans.5 It should be acknowledged that many of these elements, steps and outcomes could also support or strengthen any and all of the other planning processes profiled within this guide.\n","3623:  Because of the complexity of watersheds, including the diversity of interconnections and dynamic change over time, an iterative process is recommended for watershed management planning.\n","3624:  The following figure from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency illustrates this (Figure 3).\n","3625:  v e l o p Plan e D Ev al u a t e plan M a kes Changes I m p l e m e n t plan E v a l u a t e p la n M a ke Chang e s I m p l e m e n t pla n Figure 3.\n","3626:  Diagram of the Watershed Planning Process.4 35 7.3 stORmWA teR (RAinWA teR) mAnAGement PlAns Another important aspect of water and watershed planning is the management of rainwater or stormwater.\n","3628:  It is widely recognized that urban development can increase impervious surfaces, impacting the hydrology of local streams.\n","3629:  Rural resource activities such as forestry can also influence land cover, and thus impact, hydrology.\n","3630:  Projections of increased stormwater runoff as a result of climate change and urban development have led some municipalities to seek additional funds for infrastructure upgrades, while other communities are examining alternative approaches to managing rainwater.\n","3631:  In addition to, or instead of, building bigger pipes, ditches and pumps to convey water from bigger storms, some communities are taking the approach of _store it, spread it, and sink it_.\n","3632:  Rainwater and stormwater can be viewed as a valuable resource that can be stored in wetlands and detention ponds and infiltrated into the ground to recharge water tables.\n","3633:  This can reduce or avoid many of the economic and environmental costs associated with the traditional model of conveying rainwater as quickly as possible from roads, rooftops and parking lots into storm sewers, drainage ditches and streams.\n","3634:  Urban stormwater runoff can adversely impact stream hydrology, fish habitat and watershed health by eroding stream banks, by causing water turbidity and siltation of spawning and rearing habitat, and by introducing other pollutants, such as oil from roads, into the system.\n","3635:  Under the Local Government Act, municipalities are responsible for the provision of drainage, and in some cases, Regional Districts may also have associated responsibilities.\n","3636:  How we handle stormwater has a huge impact on aquatic ecosystems.\n","3637:  Integrated stormwater management planning is a proactive process that utilizes land use planning tools to protect property and aquatic habitat from stormwater flows, while at the same time accommodating urban growth.\n","3638:  Ideally, the aim of these plans is to ensure that stormwater runoff resembles natural runoff patterns (i.e., volume and timing of surface water runoff), and does not transport pollutants or sediment from the land into watercourses.\n","3639:  Stormwater management plans are typically completed at the local government level, with guidance from the Province.\n","3640:  5 BC_s Stormwater Planning Guidebook, released in 2002, is premised on the idea that land development and watershed protection can be compatible.\n","3641:  It assumes that municipalities exert control over runoff volume through their land development and infrastructure policies, practices and actions.\n","3642:  Liquid Waste and Resource Management Plan.\n","3643:  To help facilitate this, Metro Vancouver developed a comprehensive ISMP Template (consistent with the provincial guide) to guide member municipalities with this process.\n","3644:  The updated LWMP is pending approval from the Minister of Environment.\n","3645:  Outdated approaches to stormwater management, which fail to respect natural systems and water cycles, have been accused of being one of the largest water pollution challenges in the province.\n","3646:  In recent years, rainwater management has emerged as a new way of thinking about the precipitation that falls on the land.\n","3647:  Instead of viewing stormwater as a site-specific problem that is best solved by piping water away from properties into streams, rainwater management considers the dynamics of the entire watershed and identifies how development can use _green infrastructure_ to maintain natural systems and protect buildings.\n","3648:  Green infrastructure is a concept that emphasizes the importance of the natural environment in decisions about land use planning.\n","3649:  For example, the installation of permeable pavements, rain gardens, bioretention ponds and constructed wetlands help reduce the volume of runoff that enters sewer systems and increase absorption.\n","3650:  Instead of relying heavily on pipes and concrete, green infrastructure takes advantage of the natural absorption, storage, evaporation and filtration services that nature provides.\n","3651:  As opposed to the quick, high-impact flush that comes with traditional approaches to stormwater management, lower impact green development seeks to mimic the natural water cycle by allowing water to infiltrate down through the ground and slowly release into the watershed.\n","3652:  The release of Beyond the Guidebook: Context for Rainwater Management and Green Infrastructure in British Columbia in 2007 has helped shift the focus of traditional stormwater management to the integrated, holistic approach that rainwater management embodies.\n","3653:  Climate change_and in particular the potential for more frequent and more intense extreme precipitation events_is an important consideration in this type of planning.\n","3654:  Urban flooding is now the leading cause of home insurance claims in Canada, and is a priority of the insurance industry.\n","3655:  For more details refer to Hazard Perceptions: Public Education Can Help Snap Flooding, from the Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction.\n","3656:  There is limited science on which to base projections for a specific location; however, some jurisdictions have identified voluntary planning contingencies for extreme precipitation based on the best science available.\n","3657:  For example, on Vancouver Island, the Capital Regional District has identified a planning contingency of a 15% increase in frequency and duration of winter storms for the next 100 years.\n","3658:  These contingencies should inform decisions about which stormwater management techniques to adopt and what the management goals should be in terms of rate of runoff.\n","3659:  Characteristics, Benefits and Applications Under the Environmental Management Act (Municipal Sewer Regulation), stormwater management planning is a formal requirement of Liquid Waste Management Plans, which is one of several mechanisms used by the Province to regulate stormwater in BC.\n","3660:  Although municipalities are generally not required to have Liquid Waste Management Plans, they often opt to complete such plans because the plans allow a suitable length of time to develop and implement effective and affordable solutions.\n","3661:  Integrated Stormwater Management Plans (ISMPs) are required to be developed and implemented by Metro Vancouver_s member municipalities in accordance with the Integrated The outcome of integrated stormwater planning includes regional or watershed level objectives and priorities, integration of these objectives into community planning, and implementation of on- site practices that reduce volume and rate of run-off and improve 36 water quality.\n","3663:  5 Some benefits of undertaking stormwater management planning and implementing completed plans include: _ Protection of the aquatic environment, including water quality and stream flow, and protection from flooding; _ Protection of community assets and infrastructure from localized flooding; _ Protection of water supply (e.g., groundwater recharge areas); _ Management of erosion and sedimentation processes; and _ Protection of aesthetic values and recreational uses of water.\n","3664:  Key Elements and Steps The Stormwater Planning Guidebook provides a detailed explanation of the various stages of preparing a plan.\n","3665:  It outlines three key steps and associated methods that work towards integrated stormwater management solutions, and five guiding principles to uphold in the process, as outlined below.\n","3667:  Identify at-risk catchments; 2.\n","3668:  Set preliminary performance

several relevant issues or themes to consider in relation to water and watershed planning.\n","3694:  Several common themes emerged from the literature that was reviewed during the preparation of this guide, from discussions with project advisors, from interviews with practitioners and community representatives and from research about water and watershed planning initiatives.\n","3695:  These recurring themes are explored in this section and shared to help communities build a broader understanding of the dynamics of watershed planning.\n","3697:  The themes explored in this section of the Guide include: _ Re-thinking Watersheds and Planning _ Community Collaboration and Engagement _ Regional Approaches _ Resourcing Planning Initiatives _ Information and Knowledge.\n","3698:  38 8.1 Re-thinkinG W AteRsheds And PlAnninG _When we try to pick out anything by itself, we find it hitched to everything else in the universe_ _ John Muir, Naturalist, Conservationist Historically, the traditional approach to water management has been fragmented, not integrated to reflect the connections within a watershed.\n","3699:  Water quality and water quantity have been managed separately, and decision making around water resources has been governed more by political boundaries than by natural ones.\n","3700:  More recently, however, watersheds have received renewed attention as an important unit for planning, and there is wide acceptance that the management and planning of water should occur at a watershed level.\n","3701:  For example, at a national level, Canada_s Federal Water Policy adopts watersheds as the preferred spatial unit for water resource planning.\n","3702:  An integrated approach to watershed planning considers the interactions between the biophysical, constructed and human landscapes within a watershed (Figure 4).\n","3703:  An integrated approach recognizes the interdependencies in both natural and human systems, as detailed in the table below.\n","3704:  Integration in the Natural System Integration in the Human System Between land and water use Mainstreaming water in the national economy Between surface water and groundwater Ensuring coordination between sectors Between water quantity and quality Between upstream and downstream Between freshwater and coastal waters Ensuring partnership between public and private sector management Involving everybody Integrated watershed planning provides a means for coordinating decisions among government and private agencies in order to resolve land use and resource management conflicts and issues.\n","3705:  The resolution of these issues is typically done through multi-stakeholder collaborative planning; through monitoring, research and consultation; by negotiating consensus; and by ensuring accountability through open communication, education and public access to information.\n","3706:  Integrated watershed planning combines scientific and technical information with cultural and social values to resolve conflicts and identify a desirable future outcome.\n","3707:  Integrated watershed management is also referred to in some regions as ecosystem-based management.\n","3708:  By this approach, _instead of managing a watershed as an adjunct to the water supply, maintaining healthy watersheds is considered a prerequisite to water management; water allocations are constrained by the larger need to ensure that the natural processes are maintained_.1 More recently, the terms _water centric planning_, _design with nature_, and the _soft path_ approach have been used in BC to discuss and promote the concepts embedded in integrated watershed management.\n","3709:  Water centric planning is described next.\n","3710:  See the web version of this guide for information on design with nature and the soft path approach.\n","3711:  Watershed Humans Integrated Watershed Management Buildings Landscape Figure 4 _ Components of Integrated Water

that resource use, land use and community design will be done with an eye towards their potential impact on a watershed.\n","3713:  This approach puts water stewardship and sustainability at the centre of land use, development, or resource planning initiatives.\n","3715:  As such, it requires that missions, mandates and accountabilities of participating agencies be ultimately integrated.\n","3716:  Water centric planning is founded upon an earlier concept used in BC_ the watershed landscape- based approach to planning.\n","3717:  Water centric planning can be used at the watershed, sub-watershed, or site level.\n","3720:  The water centric approach also builds on lessons learned from past and recent practices related to integrative planning and implementation of planning decisions.\n","3721:  It operates within the context of existing regional and municipal strategies, such as Regional Growth Strategies and Official Community Plans.\n","3722:  It can also involve inter-municipal cooperation where watershed boundaries cross local government boundaries.\n","3723:  3 The South Okanagan Regional District_s Regional Growth Strategy (RGS) was used as a pilot for water centric action in BC.\n","3724:  The policy clearly recognizes the relationship between land and water, both in terms of water use and water runoff.\n","3725:  A toolkit was developed to accompany the RGS and to guide decision making on the ground in terms of how land will be developed and water will be used, and to assist with benchmarking, monitoring and measuring key objectives within the policy.\n","3726:  8.2 COmmunity COllAbORA tiOn And enGAGement _The hope for achieving sustainability in water management lies in the establishment of interdependent, community-based

create a legacy_ The value of collaboration among, and engagement with, different orders of government, different water use sectors, stewardship organizations, and the multitude of community stakeholders is a recurring theme throughout this guide.\n","3727:  Collaboration is often cited as a key success factor in watershed planning.\n","3728:  Basically everyone has a role to play, and a responsibility to fulfill when it comes to the use, protection and sustainable management of water resources and healthy watersheds.\n","3730:  These benefits of collaboration are considered by many to be critical success factors for effective planning and implementation.\n","3732:  Recommendations for developing collaborative planning processes with local governments in BC are provided, the importance of working with First Nations is discussed, and suggestions for strengthening these critical relationships are profiled.\n","3733:  Finally, some of the concerns, challenges and barriers associated with collaborative planning are highlighted, along with some of the opportunities or breakthroughs that BC communities have experienced when navigating through these challenges.\n","3734:  Multiple Planning Partners of Local Governments in BC A growing interest and willingness within BC communities to get involved in watershed planning has emerged over the last two decades.\n","3735:  Whether for site-specific issues or for broader regional land use considerations, collaboration is becoming a preferred model of decision making in many parts of the province.\n","3736:  At the community level, a greater emphasis on collaborative planning for watersheds has put local governments in touch with a wide range of partners from different government organizations as well as representatives from both the business and stewardship communities.\n","3738:  This information is from 21 in-depth interviews with local government staff from across BC.\n","3739:  See also Section 4

values and identifying priorities; _ Collecting input, feedback and advice on key issues and documents; _ Organizing special events and open houses; _ Collecting resource data; _ Reporting violations; and, _ Managing communications and media relations.\n","3746:  Good Practices for Collaborative Multi-stakeholder Processes Bringing the right people together to discuss the myriad of issues within a watershed is no easy task, but when done well, it can be an efficient, credible, and cost effective means of developing integrated and robust solutions.\n","3747:  There is no single approach to designing a multi-stakeholder process; however, a broad set of principles, or good practices, that contribute to successful outcomes of collaborative decision-making processes is emerging.\n","3748:  The following table identifies several key elements and expected results of stakeholder engagement for successful watershed planning.\n","3749:  Criterion Purpose and incentives Stakeholder participation Description The process is driven by a shared purpose and provides incentives to participate and to work towards achieving consensus in the process.\n","3750:  All participants should agree on the types of issues to be addressed by the planning process.\n","3751:  A clear _terms of reference_ may allow groups to decide whether to participate or not.\n","3752:  All parties with a significant interest in the issues and outcome are involved throughout the process.\n","3753:  These could include residents, farmers, ranchers, businesses, industries and others.\n","3754:  Representatives should be selected in a fair and open manner by each of the groups that have an interest in the outcome.\n","3756:  Voluntary participation and commitment Parties, who are affected and/or interested, participate voluntarily and are committed to the process.\n","3757:  Self-design Clear ground rules Equal opportunity and resources Principled negotiation and respect Accountability Flexible, adaptive and creative High-quality information Cooperation Time limits The parties involved work together to design the process to suit the needs of that process and its participants.\n","3758:  As the process is initiated, a comprehensive procedural framework is established which includes clear terms of reference and operating procedures.\n","3759:  This part of the process can also help to clarify realities and expectations in terms of roles, responsibilities and limitations.\n","3760:  The process provides an equal and balanced opportunity for effective participation of all parties.\n","3761:  Multi-stakeholder planning proceeds from the assumption that everyone has something to gain by reaching agreement.\n","3762:  The process operates according to the conditions of principled negotiation, including mutual respect, trust and understanding.\n","3763:  The process and its participants are accountable to the broader public, to their constituents, and to the process itself.\n","3764:  Flexibility is designed into the process to allow for adaptation and creativity in problem solving.\n","3765:  The process incorporates high-quality information into decision-making.\n","3766:  All participants should share information and cooperate to gather what information is needed for effective planning.\n","3767:  Cooperation and working relationships between participating groups is improved both during and after the process is completed.\n","3768:  Realistic milestones and deadlines are established and managed throughout the process.\n","3769:  Commitment to implementation and monitoring The process and final agreement include clear commitments to implementation and monitoring.\n","3770:  Effective process management Independent facilitation The process is coordinated and managed effectively.\n","3771:  The process uses an independent trained facilitator throughout.\n","3772:  This may not be necessary in all cases, particularly where the planning issues may be less conflicted, where the community is not polarized, or where the lead facilitator of the planning process has established trust and credibility within the community.\n","3773:  Adapted from both WCEL (2010) and Frame et al.\n","3774:  (2004) 41 Collaboration with First Nations Intergovernmental relations around water and watershed management are challenging, and the case is no different with First Nations.\n","3775:  A key observation that emerged from workshops held with First Nations in the summer of 2010 is that _First Nations are often not consulted, not consulted enough, or not consulted soon enough_.\n","3776:  In some cases, this is attributed to existing policies and structures that limit participation by First Nations, and there is a sense that addressing First Nations_ rights can slow down a planning or decision-making process.\n","3777:  There is significant concern among First Nations that _although First Nations across Canada are already experiencing the impacts of climate change, they are often left out of policy discussions that will affect water health and security in their territories_.\n","3778:  8 Although stakeholder engagement sessions were conducted specifically for direct First Nations input some Bands have indicated the need for more direct participation in the modernization of BC_s Water Act.\n","3779:  In some cases, limited participation by First Nations relates to limited capacity within their communities.\n","3780:  It can be challenging for smaller First Nation communities who have limited resources to keep up with government invitations to participate in a multitude of referrals, and other planning and decision-making processes.\n","3781:  There is also concern that participating in such processes can sometimes be misinterpreted as _representing the First Nation community__a mandate that may not actually be afforded to one individual.\n","3782:  8 Working towards more effective collaboration with First Nations requires building government- to-government relationships that acknowledge Aboriginal title and rights.\n","3783:  To foster these relationships, it is important to develop a shared vision that celebrates differences as well as areas of common ground.\n","3784:  A shared vision enables the identification of key issues, shared goals, and action plans, and a commitment to shared decision- making.\n","3785:  Through trial and error, experiences across BC have culminated in the identification of some beneficial practices for collaboration with First Nations.\n","3786:  A series of recommended best management practices for building successful and positive relationships between First Nations and local governments was developed at a workshop with regional districts in 2005.\n","3787:  Many of these practices also apply to other relationships within collaborative decision-making processes: _ Establish a relationship before there is a problem; _ Respect each other_s differences (i.e., do not try to change each other); _ Recognize and understand that history and past experiences impact current perceptions and opinions; _ Focus on learning about each other_s history and initiate information-sharing events early in the process to learn about the respective roles, responsibilities and history of each other_s organizations; 42 _ Recognize the importance of a First Nations Chief and Council; _ Focus on slow, incremental steps and recognize that success cannot be measured in the short term; _ Work towards the project agenda after individual relationships are solidified and unified; _ Define the nature and scope of the relationship early (including an understanding of each other_s needs and the reason for interaction); _ Focus on areas of common concern or interest; _ Identify the elements of uncertainty and work towards addressing them before they create friction in the relationship; _ Be prepared to resolve disputes and agreements; _ Establish a process and forum for communication and dialogue; _ Exchange staff lists to allow for quick and effective contact between organizations; and, _ Confirm expectations and assumptions throughout the relationship.\n","3788:  Leadership and Local Champions Collaborative planning processes benefit significantly from good leadership.\n","3789:  Having a champion behind a planning initiative can really help motivate a group, and keep it focused on the end goal.\n","3790:  This can be particularly important to sustaining interest, support and momentum over the long term during the development and implementation of the plan.\n","3791:  Planning can take time, patience and persistence, and a committed and passionate champion can help build and maintain the necessary momentum.\n","3792:  This is especially important during periods of conflict or other challenges.\n","3793:  A widely respected and credible leader can also inspire broader participation and collaboration within a planning process.\n","3794:  For example, someone who has the respect of farmers, business owners and community activists can strengthen the credibility of a planning process, and thus inspire these and other stakeholders to participate in it.\n","3795:  A leader may be a mayor, chief, or chair of a regional district or other prominent board.\n","3796:  However, local champions can also be highly respected citizens, volunteers, retired professionals, or other community leaders with less official designations.\n","3797:  If there is no apparent single leader within a process, it can be helpful to bring in people from around the region and/or country who have relevant experience and expertise on key issues.\n","3798:  For example, in the early stages of developing the planning process for the Coquitlam River Watershed Strategy, people from outside the watershed were invited to share their successes and failures with their roundtable processes.\n","3799:  This helped set the bar and create inspiration within the planning group.\n","3800:  From this foundation, leadership emerged from different factions of the community, including government and beyond.\n","3801:  8.3 ReGiOnAl APPROAChes Being proactive by planning for watersheds and climate adaptation can be especially challenging for communities that have limited human and financial resources.\n","3802:  Introducing water centric thinking can be particularly challenging when facing common issues such as jurisdictional conflicts or a lack of expertise.\n","3803:  Changing the _old way of doing business_ does not happen overnight, and achieving water sustainability is less likely to happen if communities work in isolation of each other.\n","3804:  In some cases, local leadership can be supplemented and/or strengthened with collaborative approaches at the regional scale.\n","3805:  This can be particularly appropriate when implementing a watershed-based approach and an integrated approach.\n","3806:  For example, Convening for Action on Vancouver Island, the Okanagan Basin Water Board and the Fraser Basin Council offer several opportunities to collaborate at regional scales to strengthen community resiliency, protect watershed health, prepare for climate change and advance sustainability.\n","3807:  AnCOuVeR islAnd 8.3.1 COnVeninG fOR ACtiOn On V Convening for Action on Vancouver Island (CAVI) is an exciting initiative that has emerged in response to the need to plan for sustainable water resources within the context of a rapidly growing population.\n","3808:  CAVI is not a formal organization; rather, it could be considered as an _ad hoc group_ designed to provide leadership, coordination, research and education for practitioners, specifically local government administrators, engineers, planners and elected officials.\n","3809:  CAVI_s focus is to build an understanding about how we should be dealing with water as it relates to conservation, development and land use.\n","3810:  CAVI does not use a particular planning tool or process.\n","3811:  Instead, it uses the informal process of collaboration to build capacity and a network of like-minded individuals across Vancouver Island so these individuals can harness the tools of local government (e.g., Official Community Plans, bylaws) to bring about positive change in local watersheds.\n","3813:  Its aim is to move from talk to action by developing tools, providing training and building capacity.\n","3814:  At the heart of the initiative is the concept of water centric planning.\n","3815:  Through education and awareness-building initiatives, including learning lunches, CAVI demonstrates how water centric approaches and specific tools can be integrated into existing planning processes.\n","3816:  _At CAVI, we bring together those who plan and regulate land use (local governments), those who build (developers), and those who provide the legislative framework (the Province).\n","3820:  The emphasis on collaboration within CAVI, and focus on integration across the Vancouver Island region have also been critical success factors.\n","3821:  Finally, many of CAVI_s activities fulfill the principles of Living Water Smart, British Columbia_s Water Plan, and aligning with these principles has proven beneficial for local governments that are seeking funding to support water planning and management.\n","3822:  _On Vancouver Island, local governments are demonstrating what can be accomplished through partnerships and collaboration.\n","3823:  Success in moving from awareness to action is ultimately keyed to a regional team approach that is founded on the notion of shared responsibility_ _John Finnie, CAVI Chair 8.3.2 OkAnAGAn bAsin WA teR bOARd The Okanagan Basin is one of BC_s fastest growing regions.\n","3824:  With increasing demands for water by residents, tourists, and agricultural producers (which accounts for as much as 70% of water use in the basin), it is a region under pressure.\n","3825:  Significant water shortages occur in the summer months, and groundwater resources are vulnerable to contamination and drawdown.\n","3826:  In the Okanagan Valley, a regional approach has proven useful for advancing water management decisions.\n","3827:  _The Okanagan Basin Water Board (OBWB) was initiated in 1968 (legislated in 1970) as a water governance body tasked with identifying and resolving critical water issues at the scale of the Okanagan watershed_The overall objective of the organization is to undertake strategic projects and programs at the Basin scale that meet the collective needs of Okanagan citizens for long-term sustainable water supplies while supporting the capacity of member jurisdictions to meet their own water management goals_ (www.obwb.ca/about/).\n","3828:  The Board is comprised of representatives from each of the three regional districts in the basin: Okanagan-Similkameen, Central Okanagan and North Okanagan.\n","3829:  The Board also has representation from First Nations, the Water Supply Association of BC, and the Okanagan Water Stewardship Council, which was formed in 2006.\n","3830:  The Board is unique in its powers to tax and pass bylaws, and is supported through annual property tax assessments within the basin.\n","3831:  The Board does not have regulatory authority but seeks to improve water management by providing a basin-wide perspective and improving communications among regions to reduce fragmentation in policy and planning.\n","3832:  The Board also works to improve links between local and senior governments by participating as a partner in Okanagan water research and infrastructure funding.\n","3833:  Whereas municipalities and regional districts continue to plan for local water needs, watershed- scale considerations are addressed at the regional level through the leadership of the OBWB.\n","3835:  Through its work, the OBWB has sought to integrate Okanagan water policy and planning on a basin-scale by bridging the interests of multiple jurisdictions and shifting towards implementing policies and agreements that protect water supplies.\n","3836:  The Okanagan Sustainable Water Strategy (2008), which identifies top priorities for implementation in the basin in the coming years, illustrates how a regional approach can be applied to water planning and management.\n","3837:  Numerous recommendations made in this action plan are being implemented incrementally, and successes in groundwater monitoring and establishing a 43 water use reporting process have already been achieved.\n","3839:  The OBWB is the mechanism for bringing these groups together on a regional basin scale to plan and manage water resources.\n","3840:  12 8.3.3 fRAseR bAsin COunCil In the Fraser River Basin, the Fraser Basin Council (FBC) strengthens regional and watershed-based approaches to address a wide variety of sustainability issues.\n","3841:  Formed in 1997, the FBC is a charitable, not-for-profit organization with a primary mandate _to advance sustainability in British Columbia with a core focus on the Fraser River Basin._ FBC has a collaborative governance structure, which is led by 37 directors from the four orders of government_federal, provincial, local and First Nations_and from the private sector and civil society.\n","3842:  Well into its second decade of service, the FBC works to bring people together to find practical, common sense solutions to long-standing and emerging sustainability issues, such as community planning, watershed health and climate change adaptation.\n","3843:  To achieve its goals, the FBC serves as an impartial, trusted facilitator operating under a unique model of collaborative leadership.\n","3844:  The FBC was founded on the belief that the major sustainability priorities, including management of the Fraser Basin, cannot be effectively addressed by any one jurisdiction but rather by bringing together the diversity of interests and jurisdictions to solve complex problems.\n","3845:  The reason so many contentious issues remain unresolved is often because leaders in different sectors are working in isolation of each other.\n","3846:  The overall framework for the Fraser Basin Council_s work is the Charter for Sustainability.\n","3847:  The charter is a good-faith agreement, signed in 1997, by representatives from multiple sectors across the Fraser Basin who believed in collaborative action for a more sustainable future.\n","3848:  From the charter comes FBC_s vision statement and guiding principles, along with a definition of sustainability, described as: _Living and managing activities in a way that balances social, economic, environmental and institutional considerations to meet our needs and those of future generations._ The Fraser Basin Council delivers programs and projects in each of the five regions of the Fraser River Basin: Upper Fraser, Cariboo-Chilcotin, Thompson, Fraser Valley and Greater Vancouver-Sea to Sky.\n","3850:  The FBC: _ Worked with more than 100 local governments and 26 first nations across bc on community sustainability planning and climate change adaptation; _ Improved fraser basin salmon habitat, stock management, fisheries information and re_lated outreach with a high level of aboriginal engagement and many working partnerships for the health of bc fisheries; _ Launched and contributed directly to the development of a land use planning process for the shuswap lakes system to encourage development in less sensitive areas of shuswap and mara lakes, to improve waste_water management and to study recreational impacts.\n","3851:  Current priorities and next steps include protecting and restoring foreshore habitat, maintaining and improving water quality, informing and educating the public and industry groups, and initiating coordinated development and recreation plans; _ Led a panel of independent experts, result_ing in canada_s first provincial legislation on drinking water protection; _ Published four comprehensive sustainabil_ity snapshot indicators reports, and several regional reports, on the health of the fraser basin and province of bc to raise awareness and encourage action across sectors on economic, social and environmental

more precious than oil_ _Tony Blair, former British Prime Minister Integrated water and watershed planning requires a dedicated and skilled team of people.\n","3853:  Ongoing involvement in a collaborative planning process is a significant commitment for local governments and others, who often cite inadequate resources and overtaxed staff as primary limitations on being more proactively engaged in certain aspects of watershed protection.\n","3855:  Without the necessary financial and human resources it is challenging for some communities to effectively manage and/or participate in collaborative processes.\n","3856:  Within this challenging context of limited financial and human resources, the BC experience is showing that success in advancing water and watershed planning often comes down to creative initiatives and well-conceived projects.\n","3857:  While an increase in both financial and human resources is desirable, it may not be realistic in many communities.\n","3858:  Instead, communities are required to work more creatively with both internal and external resources in order to advance their goals for water and watershed protection.\n","3859:  44 8.4.1 stRenGthen humAn ResOuRCes Human resources, both in terms of availability and expertise, can be a limitation to water and watershed planning and to climate adaptation.\n","3861:  Contracting out portions of the work to supplement or complement staff skills and expertise may be possible in some circumstances; however, this option is not always available to local governments, which often have limited funds.\n","3862:  Capacity may be limited in smaller BC communities, where there may be only one or two municipal staff to cover planning responsibilities, and where funds may be too limited to cover the costs of hiring consultants.\n","3863:  This may be a particular challenge for proactive initiatives, such as water and watershed planning, and for integrating climate change adaptation into such plans.\n","3866:  In contrast, larger local governments, such as Metro Vancouver and the Capital Regional District, which have greater staff capacity, are able to attract more funds, and advance planning and management initiatives.\n","3868:  The Value of a Coordinator Many communities have found that having a project coordinator is often key to the success of water and watershed planning initiatives.\n","3869:  In the case of the Bowker Creek Urban Watershed Renewal Initiative, having a part-time Coordinator, whose salary is cost-shared by all three participating municipalities, has been key to securing project funding.\n","3870:  This person is able to dedicate time to writing grant applications, and having a Coordinator has given the project greater credibility.\n","3871:  A Watershed Coordinator has also helped secure funds for the Theodosia Stewardship Roundtable and Watershed Recovery Plan, and as a result, he is able to focus on both land and water management within the watershed.\n","3872:  8.4.2 stRenGthen finAnCiAl ResOuRCes Resourcing can significantly influence the success of planning, and is commonly cited as a limiting factor in planning processes.\n","3873:  Resources are needed to establish and manage a planning process, and to implement its outcomes (i.e., the plan_s recommendations).\n","3875:  Whether a planning initiative is just beginning, in mid process, or ready for implementation, financial resources play a significant role in the timing, momentum, and in some cases, the outcomes of the process.\n","3876:  The funding environment for water and watershed planning in BC is challenging and competitive.\n","3877:  Funds are limited; therefore, competition for grants is high.\n","3879:  Local governments also have limited human resources for developing project proposals and writing and submitting grant applications.\n","3880:  The situation is similar for climate adaptation planning processes.\n","3881:  While funds may be available for climate adaptation planning, it is more difficult for local governments to secure funds to implement adaptation measures.\n","3882:  Even in communities that have been actively developing climate adaptation plans, it is difficult to justify spending substantial sums of money on implementing those plans.\n","3883:  For example, making proactive choices to upgrade municipal utilities may make sense on one level, but when there may be no immediate, tangible benefits, it can be difficult to persuade taxpayers and elected officials to commit to large investments.\n","3885:  Thinking the process through in terms of phases and how those phases will be financed is an important step.\n","3886:  It is first necessary to know what needs to be accomplished and what the measurable objectives are for the various aspects of the project.\n","3887:  For each objective, consider: _ When will the money be needed?\n","3888:  _ Where will it come from?\n","3889:  _ How will it be directed?\n","3890:  _If you wait until you have enough money, you_ll never do it._ _ ToM ruTherFord, Georgia Basin Living Rivers Program When developing a funding model or strategy it is important to be creative.\n","3891:  There is no single, certain way of securing funds for a watershed project.\n","3892:  Each community has its own set of challenges and opportunities.\n","3893:  A successful financial strategy will take both challenges and opportunities into consideration.\n","3894:  The following are recommendations, gathered from various communities across the province, for successfully obtaining project funding: _ Be strategic; look at the bigger picture.\n","3895:  Design your project so that it can advance multiple objectives, such as climate change mitigation and/or adaptation and environmental enhancement.\n","3896:  Recently, the integration of climate change adaptation into planning projects has become strategic from a funding perspective.\n","3898:  Another _big picture approach_ is to integrate watershed planning within land use decisions.\n","3899:  This may open up new opportunities by diversifying funding sources.\n","3900:  _ Align with common objectives.\n","3901:  Identifying how various departments and/or external organizations can contribute to project objectives is important for moving a project forward, both within the planning process and during implementation.\n","3902:  The approach adopted within the Whistler 2020 Plan was intended to allow the community to use community resources in a more strategic and coordinated way.\n","3903:  The community of Whistler invested time in identifying common goals and a shared vision across organizations within the community.\n","3904:  Rather than requiring new resources, the Whistler2020 approach is based on the alignment of existing budgets and resources to ensure that all relevant organizations and individuals are dedicated to moving toward a shared goal rather than working inefficiently or at cross- purposes.\n","3905:  This approach seeks to make the best use of existing resources.\n","3906:  _ Be realistic about project timelines and budgets.\n","3907:  The Bowker Creek Initiative adopted a 100-year timeline because the work that needs to be done in the watershed is too costly to be funded all at once.\n","3908:  Rather than getting bogged down in the high costs of implementation, the team developed a long-term plan that focuses on specific reaches of the creek and on achieving incremental progress.\n","3909:  Municipalities can agree in principle about the scope and direction of the plan without being held responsible for spending a specific amount of money.\n","3910:  The idea behind this strategy is not to deflect responsibility and _do nothing_; rather, once the regional district saw past the financial challenges, they committed to moving the plan forward by working on key short-term actions now that would set them up for bigger things in the future.\n","3911:  45 _ Leverage funds.\n","3912:  Grant leveraging entails using one source of funds to attract and match funds from other sources.\n","3913:  It is an effective means of bringing in additional money to support an expanding project or one with an extended timeline.\n","3914:  _ Consider what can be accomplished without financial contributions.\n","3915:  Participants in the Theodosia Stewardship Roundtable state that planning groups do not need a lot of money to initiate watershed planning.\n","3916:  In-kind contributions can be a significant source of resources for getting a project started.\n","3917:  Once successes start to be demonstrated through the use of these contributions, it becomes easier to attract funds from other sources.\n","3920:  Consider Alternative Sources of Funds Various means of generating funds for water management projects have been tried in different communities.\n","3921:  Some of these are listed below.\n","3922:  It is important to consider the potential that these may bring, within the context of each community.\n","3923:  Conducting an economic analysis of which mechanisms are most appropriate to a community would be beneficial, as would an assessment of public and political support for those mechanisms.\n","3924:  _ Development Cost Charges (DCCs) have been used in some BC communities to support operational initiatives in water management.\n","3925:  As a pilot project, the town of Oliver, BC received approval to use DCC funds collected from new development to help establish water meters for existing homes with the resulting water savings becoming available to provide water services to new homes.\n","3926:  DCCs have also been a key part of the City of Surrey_s strategy to build sustainable drainage infrastructure.\n","3927:  Surrey has used the funds to pay for a roadside storm water management swale/multi-use greenway in a new development, rather than the usual purchase of 5-6% of the area for the purposes of a detention pond.\n","3928:  _ Volume-based Water Use Fees can be applied either to individuals or water suppliers to target heavy-use water consumers and to provide incentives for water conservation.\n","3929:  The fee structure needs to be equitable to avoid creating economic hardship for low-income residents and the agricultural community.\n","3930:  _ Municipal Drainage Utilities can be formed as an alternate source of raising funding.\n","3931:  This approach can help ensure dedicated funding for drainage and stormwater planning, infrastructure and operations.\n","3932:  46 _ Water Licence Fees collected by the Ministry of Forests, Lands and Natural Resource Operations currently go into provincial general revenue.\n","3933:  In theory, a portion of these funds could be directed to specifically support water and watershed planning.\n","3934:  If local government becomes actively involved in licence administration at any level, some of these funds could be used to fund water conservation and management projects at the local level.16 _ Recreational User Fees applied to powerboat or off-road vehicle rentals are a means of targeting polluting activities of tourists or seasonal residents who do not otherwise contribute funds to water management in a region.16 _ Reserve Funds can be established by implementing changes in service delivery systems (e.g., contracting out a regional service), which can sometimes translate into savings for a local government.\n","3935:  In the Region of Peel, in Ontario, such a savings translated into a permanent, annual cost reduction of 1.5% on water rates.\n","3936:  Staff commitment and forward thinking leadership enabled these savings to be channeled into a fund, which is not constrained by the normal budget cycle.\n","3937:  The City of Toronto directed revenue from property sales into the _Toronto Atmospheric Revolving Fund_, which finances innovative greenhouse gas emission reduction projects.\n","3938:  Interest and royalties from these projects are returned to the fund.\n","3939:  One merit of this approach is that it does not require any additional taxation.\n","3940:  8.5 infORmA tiOn And knOWledGe The importance of accurate, relevant and meaningful data, information and knowledge cannot be underestimated in relation to water and watershed planning.\n","3941:  Although subtle nuances differentiate data from information and knowledge, for the purposes of this section of the guide, the term _information_ will be used explicitly, and data and knowledge will be considered as being related implicitly.\n","3942:  Information is critical to water and watershed planning in a variety of ways.\n","3943:  Information about current (or historical) water issues, challenges and conflicts alerts communities and decision makers about the need for planning, policy and/or operational management actions.\n","3944:  Information about future scenarios, such as population projections or climate change scenarios, can help inform planners and others about possible issues they may need to address.\n","3945:  Information about the effectiveness of management options can be used to assess recommended actions in response to current or future challenges.\n","3946:  8.5.1 infORmA tiOn needs And sOuRCes The following are some examples of data and information that may be beneficial or necessary to inform a water and watershed planning process: Current and projected future water supply: _ Seasonal and annual streamflow (volume and timing); _ Surface and groundwater reserves (extent and volume); _ Changes to precipitation and evapotranspiration as a result of climate change; and, _ Changes to storage and distribution capacity associated with water supplies.\n","3947:  Current and projected future water demand: _ Current water use by all human consumptive and non-consumptive uses; _ Current instream flow requirements for fish, wildlife, habitat and ecosystem functions; and, _ Changes to water demand as a result of population growth, community and economic development and/or climate change.\n","3948:  Current and projected future threats to water quality: _ Changes to settlement patterns, land use and associated pollutants; and, _ Changes to hydrology and geomorphology as a result of land use, land cover and/or climate change.\n","3949:  Data and information are also needed to monitor and measure performance in relation to the objectives and desired outcomes of a water or watershed plan (or related regulatory requirements).\n","3950:  For example, it may be necessary to monitor compliance with water licences, instream flow requirements, water use restrictions, wastewater discharges, riparian area regulations and/or water quality standards or objectives.\n","3951:  If performance measures are not established and assessed, it may not be possible to determine if the goals and objectives of a water or watershed plan are being achieved.\n","3952:  Some examples of information sources to support water and watershed planning are listed below (in alphabetical order).\n","3953:  In many cases, further analysis of available information and/or more detailed local information will be necessary to support planning processes.\n","3954:  See Section 9 of this guide Tools and Resources for more information (including web links) about where to go for relevant information on water, watershed and climate science.\n","3955:  _ BC Hydro _ Regional

8.5.2 infORmA tiOn GAPs And limit AtiOns Data for water, watershed and climate change planning is not available consistently across the province.\n","3957:  For example, there may be gaps or limitations in: _ Spatial coverage (e.g., available information may not cover a particular river, stream, lake or watershed); _ Temporal coverage (e.g., a full range of historical or current information, or future projections may not be available); and, _ Measured parameters (e.g., information may be available for only a subset of the necessary water quantity or quality variables).\n","3958:  Basic hydrological information is not available for many streams, lakes and aquifers in BC.\n","3959:  Similarly, water quality information is limited.\n","3961:  In some regions, such as the Capital Regional District, where communities are close to academic institutions, there is a relatively good supply of data and information to inform planning efforts.\n","3962:  However, in small to mid-sized communities, less data is available both for climate and water and watershed planning.\n","3963:  Also, in some cases, loal governments do not always know what data are available or how to source or use the data.\n","3965:  The submission of well log information, which is housed by the Province, is voluntary, and people are often slow in submitting the data or they provide incomplete information.\n","3966:  Accessing data for privately held upland areas in watersheds is another significant challenge for local governments.\n","3967:  Forest companies are required to file detailed environmental plans for every cutblock; however, this information typically is not made available.\n","3968:  Communities may be able to acquire data, but in many cases it is not in an accessible format.\n","3969:  Local governments have experienced considerable challenges related to the format and completeness of data.\n","3970:  Often, data are developed for specific purposes and are not compatible with other purposes or a particular study area.\n","3971:  In other cases, available data may not be specific enough for developing plans for a particular region or watershed.\n","3973:  Finally, the level of detail in which data are presented is not always useful.\n","3974:  For example, in a community such as Tofino, which has very localized weather cells, it is difficult to use general climate data because the nearest weather station is not representative of the weather in Tofino.\n","3975:  Information gaps and limitations grow significantly when it comes to understanding the complexity of watershed resources, health and function.\n","3976:  In an ideal scenario, a watershed inventory and assessment is undertaken to build a broad understanding of the full resources, functions and characteristics of a watershed.\n","3977:  In many cases, watershed inventories and assessments have not been undertaken or they have been limited in scope.\n","3978:  There is no single, comprehensive source of watershed data.\n","3979:  Information resources should be considered in a similar light as financial and human resources.\n","3980:  As with funding and people, information is a critical element to support a water or watershed planning process.\n","3981:  However, there can be significant limitations and constraints that need to be understood and addressed in order to acquire and use the information necessary to develop and implement watershed plans.\n","3982:  8.6 RefeRenCes 1 Brandes, Oliver et.\n","3983:  (2005).\n","3984:  At A Watershed:

global health threat of the 21st century.\n","4285:  Here in British Columbia, climate change is clearly observable and many people are already feeling its effects.\n","4286:  With some degree of climate change now locked-in regardless of mitigation efforts, climate change adaptation is necessary to ensure British Columbia will fare well in the future.\n","4287:  The challenge is significant, but British Columbia is well positioned to respond given strong capacity across different sectors.\n","4289:  These actions often fall within the day-to-day responsibilities of the health care community and align with the sector_s overarching goal: improving health and well-being outcomes for all British Columbians.\n","4290:  CLIMATE CHANGE AND HEALTH Climate change is likely to impact most areas of our lives, including our health.\n","4291:  In British Columbia, the principal hazards include rising temperatures, sea level rise, and increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events.\n","4293:  Population and community health are influenced by wider social, cultural, economic and environmental factors.\n","4294:  These factors are commonly known as health determinants, and they are closely linked to a range of health outcomes.\n","4295:  Increasingly, climate change hazards are impacting health determinants.\n","4296:  As illustrated in the figure,

Information to Guide Adaptation Research and Decisions_ was first published in the fall of 2014 and has since proven to be a useful tool of reference for both the climate change adaptation community and for those wanting to communicate climate information to decision-makers.\n","4307:  Since its publication, the guidebook has been the subject of numerous presentations through different conferences, seminars, and webinars.\n","4308:  It has also been tested through a series of workshops with users from different sectors of activity.\n","4309:  Many of these presentations and workshops were designed to understand how the document was being used and to obtain specific feedback on the content presented in the guide.\n","4310:  This updated version of the guidebook on climate scenarios was modified based on comments obtained by users throughout this process.\n","4311:  Both the original guidebook, the subsequent testing of the document, and this updated version were all funded by Natural Resources Canada under the Adaptation Platform Program.\n","4312:  The Platform_s Regional Adaptation Collaborative (RAC) and Tools Working Group identified this as an important need for adaptation decision-making which would build on the results of the RAC and Tools Program (2009-2012).\n","4313:  The RAC and Tools Program was a $35 million, cost-shared initiative to support collaborative action towards the development of resources and tools to help local practitioners and decision-makers reduce the risks and maximize opportunities arising from a changing climate.\n","4314:  Users of the Guidebook are invited to send questions and comments to Isabelle Charron : charron.isabelle@ouranos.ca.\n","4315:  GUIDEBOOK ON CLIMATE SCENARIOS | V EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Climate change is unequivocal.\n","4316:  There is ample evidence from around the globe that changes have already occurred.\n","4317:  This reality is forcing decision-makers to evaluate the potential impacts, risks, vulnerabilities and opportunities that climate change presents.\n","4318:  The development of adaptation plans and actions to adjust to this new reality requires decision-makers to increase their understanding of climate information.\n","4319:  However, given the complexity of climate science, climate change information often remains difficult to understand by many users.\n","4320:  There is clear need for providers of climate information to find different ways to present information in order to engage stakeholders from different sectors.\n","4321:  This transfer of knowledge between climate scientists and users must not only include the climate information itself, but also a discussion about how climate information is produced and about the uncertainties that are associated with this information.\n","4322:  These uncertainties are often viewed as barriers to climate change adaptation but a better understanding of them, and more importantly, a better comprehension of how they affect the interpretation of future impacts can alleviate some of the challenges associated with using climate information.\n","4323:  This guidebook is meant to address some of the main challenges practitioners of adaptation to climate change often face in using climate information.\n","4325:  This guide is arguably most useful to those with limited climate information experience as it provides a general introduction of many concepts related to climate science and climate scenarios production.\n","4326:  Given the complexity of climate science, the document highlights the importance of working in collaboration with climate service providers and will help users engage more easily with them.\n","4327:  For users more familiar with climate information, or those who regularly use climate data, the document will help identify ways to best showcase their results for different target audiences.\n","4328:  Indeed, it is not uncommon for users who are very familiar with climate information to have to translate that information for users or stakeholders who are themselves not as comfortable with such information.\n","4329:  The guide is divided into five chapters.\n","4330:  Chapter 1 provides fact sheets of key concepts in future climate modeling.\n","4331:  This section helps users become more familiar with climate science jargon, which is often necessary to better understand climate information; Chapter 2 outlines a framework to categorize climate information in terms of its purpose and complexity into three categories: basic, intermediate, and detailed.\n","4332:  This section uses a decision-tree approach to helps users better formulate their climate information needs; Chapter 3 provides a catalogue of climate information formats that can be associated to one of the three categories identified in the previous chapter.\n","4333:  This section describes different ways in which climate information may be provided to different users based on their level of expertise and preference; Chapter 4 discusses best practices in using future climate information given its inherent uncertainty; Chapter 5 highlights some case studies of how climate information can be used to guide decisions in climate change adaptation.\n","4334:  VI | GUIDEBOOK ON CLIMATE SCENARIOS KEY MESSAGES FOR THE INTERPRETATION AND USE OF CLIMATE INFORMATION _ Take the time to properly evaluate your needs regarding climate information.\n","4335:  Interaction with climate service or information providers is of utmost importance throughout the planning or _ decision process- make sure that the provider understands your issues.\n","4336:  _ Seek advice and guidance from climate service providers and/or boundary organizations if the level of complexity of the information you seek is beyond the current capacity of your organization.\n","4337:  _ The same climate information can be presented or tailored using different formats _ work in collaboration with climate service providers to find a format that works best for your specific needs.\n","4338:  _ Choosing the most adequate information product and format can ensure that the information is well understood and hence used most efficiently.\n","4339:  _ All types of climate information can be equally valuable _ basic information can inform decisions just as well as detailed information.\n","4340:  _ Do not rely solely on the mean or median scenario _ the range (i.e.\n","4341:  the uncertainty) in model projections should always be considered.\n","4342:  _ There is no such thing as the best climate scenario _ the use of an ensemble of simulations is crucial.\n","4343:  _ Understand the limitations of the climate information used and make sure the information is interpreted correctly.\n","4344:  _ The natural variability in the climate is valuable information_ use it to put the projected changes into perspective.\n","4345:  _ Finer spatial resolution is not always needed and does not always yield better information.\n","4346:  _ The relative importance of sources of uncertainty varies over time and therefore impact the decision-making process differently.\n","4347:  GUIDEBOOK ON CLIMATE SCENARIOS | VII LIST OF ACRONYMES CMIP CRCM DJF EVT GCM GEV GHG ICLEI IPCC JJA MAM .\n","4348:  PCIC RCM RCP SON SRES WMO

SCENARIOS INTRODUCTION THE NEED FOR THIS GUIDE Climate change has become an important concern around the globe and in order to adapt to its impacts, the expected changes must first be understood.\n","4423:  It can be argued that climate science has now reached a certain level of maturity that renders it more valuable and useful for decision-makers.\n","4424:  At the same time, however, the potential impacts of climate change raise an increasing number of issues that decision-makers have to deal with.\n","4425:  Consequently, making decisions based on climate information is far from straightforward.\n","4426:  Identifying and obtaining the relevant information can be a challenge in and of itself but is one of many steps required to develop an adaptation framework (Figure 1).\n","4427:  These steps largely stem from guidelines outlined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in the early 1990s for impacts and adaptation studies1_3.\n","4428:  They have been described in a growing body of literature (e.g.4_8), however, most guides focused on impacts and adaptation generally give very limited guidance regarding the various types of climate information available.\n","4429:  In this context, this guide aims to provide a tool that will help decision-makers better understand different types of climate information and help them better identify how this information can be used at different stages of the adaptation process.\n","4430:  Knowledge exchange between climate service providers and users is increasingly recognized as an important step in the decision making process9.\n","4431:  DEFINING ADAPTATION AND DECISION-MAKER The term adaptation is used in this guide to refer to all processes, actions and strategies that allow individuals, communities, and organizations to cope with, manage, and adjust to changing climatic conditions such that risks are minimized and opportunities are seized10.\n","4432:  Adaptation is therefore used in a broad sense and encompasses a number of actions that are often separated into two categories11: _ _ In building adaptive capacity, which includes establishing systems for data collection and research, increasing awareness, evaluating vulnerabilities and risks, supporting social structures as well as governance.\n","4433:  In exploring adaptation outcomes, which includes initiating activities that reduce vulnerabilities or exploit opportunities.\n","4434:  In concordance with the term adaptation, the term decision-maker is used in this guide to include all individuals that partake in any one of the activities listed above.\n","4435:  It therefore includes a wide range of users from those starting a reflection on climate change to those ready to implement adaptation measures.\n","4436:  It is important to recognize that a given decision-maker may, over time, find himself at different stages of the adaptation framework.\n","4437:  For instance, decision-makers may consider or implement different decisions as their knowledge of climate information increases or as conditions change.\n","4438:  For example, a policy maker may first want to evaluate the potential vulnerability of a city to climate change (Step 4 in Figure 1) and based on that first evaluation, he/she may ultimately want to revise norms and policies to include specific adaptation measures (Steps 5 and 6 in Figure 1).\n","4439:  The diversity and availability of climate information have evolved over the years.\n","4440:  However, climate information is generally not exploited to its fullest potential.\n","4443:  Consequently, recognizing what and how to use climate information may not always be straightforward.\n","4444:  In addition, their needs may require more specific information that must be customized to some degree to suit their expertise.\n","4445:  Indeed, _generic_ decision support tools are not easily constructed given that climate related decisions are made at multiple levels and by a range of actors with varying capacities to handle the information13,14.\n","4446:  Finally, climate information must be communicated and transferred efficiently and the optimal format used to convey the information may differ among users.\n","4447:  GUIDEBOOK ON CLIMATE SCENARIOS | 2 STEP 1 _ Build a team _ Beging a dicussionon the issues or activity sector to

information?\n","4455:  The term climate information is used in this document to refer to climate data that are obtained from observations from meteorological stations or from climate models.\n","4456:  The former provides information on historical events while the latter can simulate both past and future periods.\n","4457:  The focus of the guide is largely on future climate information.\n","4458:  TARGET AUDIENCE This guide is intended to be broad-reaching and written in a general fashion in order to help decision- makers from all sectors of activity faced with the task of evaluating the impacts of climate change and/or of implementing adaptation measures.\n","4459:  In other words, the guide targets an audience already invested in climate change adaptation that is for example going through an adaptation process described in Figure 1.\n","4460:  The information presented will be particularly useful for users who have limited experience with climate information and climate services.\n","4461:  A better understanding of the available climate information will increase their ability to evaluate their particular needs and to either prepare the information themselves or to communicate their requirements to climate service providers.\n","4462:  Climate service providers will also benefit from the guide since it will help them better categorize demands in terms of the use or purpose of the climate information and acquire a better sense of the different types of climate formats that can be tailored according to user expertise.\n","4463:  The latter is also true for those who regularly use climate data and therefore understand climate science concepts well but must often find a way to present their results to stakeholders who may not generally be as familiar with climate information.\n","4464:  OBJECTIVES The overall objectives of this guidebook are to increase the capacity of decision-makers to understand climate information and to incorporate this information in a decision-making framework.\n","4465:  The guide should, on one hand, serve as a reminder to users to become more critical of the information that is given to them, and on the other, it should also serve as a reminder to climate service providers to become more transparent about the way in which climate information is produced.\n","4466:  HOW TO USE THIS GUIDE This

climate is not constant.\n","4474:  While the weather varies on a daily basis, climate captures variations on all time scales, from one decade or century to the next, and even on a seasonal and yearly basis (Figure 2).\n","4476:  These differences are referred to as the natural variability in the climate, or climate variability.\n","4479:  Many such climatic phenomena that are part of real world natural variability emerge from climate model simulations but they often exhibit different statistical properties.\n","4480:  Figure 2 | Example of the natural variability in annual mean temperatures, as well as 10 and 30 year moving averages, without the effect of a long-term trend (such as would be produced under a climate signal with increases in GHG).\n","4481:  Source: T. Logan (Ouranos) 7 | GUIDEBOOK ON CLIMATE SCENARIOS 1.2 CLIMATE CHANGE Climate change is a long-term continuous change, an increasing or decreasing trend, in relation to average baseline conditions.\n","4482:  This change is strongly modulated by the natural variability in the climate.\n","4483:  Figure 2 shows annual mean temperature data plotted over time.\n","4484:  Clearly, the annual temperature is not constant but varies from year-to-year.\n","4485:  This natural variability will persist, even if the long-term trend is for annual mean temperature to increase, as shown in Figure 3.\n","4486:  A B This implies that, in order to pick up a clear climate change signal (Figure 3), climate data must be averaged over relatively long periods of time (see Box on Climate normals).\n","4487:  Given the natural variability in the climate, it will still be possible with climate change, to experience short terms trends that are opposite to the overall projected trend due to climate change.\n","4488:  It is therefore important to beware of trends that are calculated over a relatively small number of years (Figure 3a).\n","4489:  Figure 3 | Time-series of annual temperature over Quebec, as simulated by the Canadian Regional Climate Model, along with trend lines for a relatively A. short period and B. longer period that highlight the fact that short- term trends may not reflect long-term climate change trends.\n","4490:  Source: R. deEl_a (Ouranos) Climate normals Climate normals are averages of climate indices used to represent the recent past climate for a given area.\n","4491:  The time period used for climate normals often corresponds to the time period used as a baseline or reference period in climate change calculations.\n","4492:  Note that climate normals should not be confused with reference period.\n","4493:  Climate normals are calculated using observed station data while reference period values are calculated using outputs from simulations.\n","4494:  Climate normals are calculated using observations of temperature and precipitation that have been collected globally since the mid-19th century (some stations have longer time series), along with other climate variables on a more selective basis.\n","4495:  To facilitate comparisons among studies, climate centers around the world tend to converge on a similar 30-year timeframe to represent climate normals, which are endorsed by the WMO.\n","4496:  However, it is important to note that other sources of observations such as satellite data are available for much shorter and more recent time periods.\n","4497:  The particularities of the study undertaken by the decision-maker can influence the baseline period chosen.\n","4498:  What is important is that the reference or baseline period be long enough to adequately characterize the long-term climatic conditions and not be overly influenced by short-term variability.\n","4499:  For example, a 10 year average could easily be influenced by a short-term warming or cooling trend, whereas a 30 year average would likely smooth out much of this effect (as seen in Figure 2).\n","4500:  GUIDEBOOK ON CLIMATE SCENARIOS | 8 1.3 CLIMATE MODELS Climate models are numerical tools based on mathematical equations that aim to represent processes of the climate system.\n","4501:  These equations are based on physical laws which govern fluid mechanics, such as the laws of conservation of mass, energy, and momentum.\n","4502:  They describe the behaviour and interactions between the atmosphere, lithosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere and biosphere, under external forcings such as solar radiation, aerosols, as well as natural and anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (Figure 4).\n","4503:  Figure 4 | Interactions described by climate models (left panel) and an example of the discrete grids used to compart mentalize the climate system (right panel).\n","4504:  Source: Ouranos Numerous climate models have been developed by different climate science centers around the world.\n","4505:  The models differ in a number of factors, such as the choice of the numerical scheme, the degree of simplification, the resolution of their grid and the way in which they represent physical phenomena that occur at scales finer than the one resolved directly by the basic equations (known as parameterization).\n","4506:  Also, an important difference among models comes from the geophysical fields used to represent the soil textures and the vegetation types and cover.\n","4507:  These fields along with the topography and the GHG concentration / emission are needed as inputs in climate models.\n","4509:  As the nature of the climatic system is non-linear (chaotic), obtaining an exact analytical solution of the mathematical equations over the entire globe would require so many simplifications that the solution would be too different from the real system to be very useful.\n","4510:  The way to minimize these simplifications is to solve the system of equations numerically with a supercomputer and sophisticated numerical methods.\n","4511:  In order to obtain the most accurate representation of the climate, these equations would ideally be solved for every point of the atmosphere, oceans and of the upper layer of the soil, but in practice this is impossible.\n","4512:  Instead, these components of the climate system are divided into discrete boxes or grid cells covering the planet (Figure 4, right panel).\n","4513:  The size of the grid cells, both horizontally and vertically, determines the resolution of the climate model.\n","4514:  Thus, a climate model is a simulator consisting of computer code that provides a discrete representation (i.e.\n","4515:  on a grid) in space and time of the basic equations of fluid mechanics solved using a numerical scheme.\n","4518:  GCMs are divided into three main categories.\n","4519:  The very first GCM generation of models to be developed were referred to as atmospheric general circulation models (AGCM), and only included the atmosphere portion of the climate system and its interaction with the continental land surface.\n","4520:  The second generation of models, termed atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AOGCM), coupled the atmosphere and land with physical ocean models.\n","4521:  The latest generation of models, known as Earth system models (ESM), now include the addition of biogeochemical interactions and cycles, as well as changes in land cover (such as vegetation types).\n","4522:  Thus far, the carbon cycle has been implemented in most ESMs and research is ongoing to include other cycles.\n","4523:  Regional Climate Models (RCMs): RCMs have smaller domains that cover only a portion of the planet.\n","4524:  By focusing on a limited area of the globe, it is possible to solve the climate model equations over a finer horizontal resolution (45 km or less) within a reasonable amount of time.\n","4525:  In order to run regional climate models, data from global climate models must be integrated at their boundaries (this can also be done using reanalyses; essentially a technique that uses computer models to combine historical data from various sources to recreate the past climate).\n","4526:  This procedure is called driving a regional climate model.\n","4527:  Model Resolution There is a tendency to believe that the finer the resolution over which the information is given, the more adequate, usable or richer it is.\n","4528:  As a result, there may be a desire to use regional climate models or statistically downscaled data instead of the outputs from global climate models directly.\n","4529:  Ultimately, the choice of one type of data versus another resides in the evaluation of numerous factors, but it is important to understand that increased model resolution does not guarantee a superior model performance for all variables.\n","4530:  Moreover, increased resolution (through the use of downscaling techniques for example) will not necessarily yield more useful information to the decision-maker.\n","4531:  However, higher resolution allows for a finer representation of topographic features, which may be very important for some variables, particularly those representing extreme events.\n","4532:  GUIDEBOOK ON CLIMATE SCENARIOS | 10 1.4 EMISSIONS SCENARIOS As discussed above, an important component (forcing) of the climate is the emission of greenhouse gases GHG), and consequently GHG forcing is also an important component of the numerical simulation of the climate.\n","4534:  First, for the past, emissions inputs come from observations made at different stations around the globe.\n","4535:  Second, for the future, the evolution of greenhouse gases is obtained from what are called emissions scenarios.\n","4537:  They are based on a coherent and internally consistent set of assumptions about driving forces, such as technological change, demographic and socioeconomic development, and their key interactions (IPCC 200718).\n","4539:  Consequently, levels of future emissions are uncertain and thus these scenarios provide alternative visions of how the future may unfold.\n","4540:  The choice of the emission scenario is responsible for a large proportion of the uncertainty in climate projections, particularly in the latter part of the 21st century (see uncertainties).\n","4541:  The range in the different emissions scenarios reflects our current understanding and knowledge about future socioeconomic and technological developments that may or may not be realized.\n","4542:  As new knowledge becomes available about these underlying assumptions, emissions scenarios are revised and made available to the scientific community.\n","4543:  Emission scenario development is a process that occurs in parallel with the development of climate models.\n","4544:  Teams of researchers are dedicated to evaluating how emissions will evolve in the future and these scenarios are then used to run climate models in order to produce simulations of future climate, each dependent upon a given emissions scenario.\n","4545:  Concentrations of greenhouse gases are currently being described using Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs).\n","4546:  These emission scenarios were the basis of the latest, Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) published in 2013 by the IPCC19.\n","4547:  RCPs contain emission, concentration and land-use trajectories and are meant to be representative of the current literature on emissions and concentration of greenhouse gases.\n","4548:  The premise is that any single RCP trajectory can result from a diverse range of socioeconomic and technological development scenarios.\n","4549:  Future climate projections presented in the third and fourth IPCC Assessment reports were based on SRES scenarios (Table 1, Figure 5).\n","4550:  Four RCP families were developed and named according to their total radiative forcing (in W/ m2) around 2100 (Table 1, Figure 5).\n","4551:  They range from RCP2.6, which assumes an eventual decline in CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere during the 21st century and projects the smallest changes in global surface temperatures, to RCP8.5, which is based on steadily increasing CO2 concentrations, leading to the highest projected changes in surface temperatures by 2100 and beyond (Table 1, Figure 5).\n","4552:  Emissions scenarios over time Emissions scenarios over time: RCPs replaced an earlier set of emission scenarios, published in a Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (IPCC 200020), hence known as the SRES scenarios.\n","4553:  The SRES

recent, Fifth Assessment Report, observations of GHG were used until 2005, after which emissions scenarios were used as inputs (see black vertical lines on Figure 5, Figure 6).\n","4564:  Given that the IPCC report was published in 2013, one could question why the observations, which are available until the present day, stop being used in 2005?\n","4565:  The decision on the last _past_ year is made by the climate community and reflects the time needed for climate scientists to produce climate simulations, publish their results in peer-reviewed scientific literature, and to write the chapters of the IPCC report.\n","4567:  Figure 6 | Timeline for the use of observed (pre-2005) and simulated CO2 (post 2005) concentrations in climate simulation production available in the CMIP5 ensemble.\n","4568:  Source: T. Logan (Ouranos) 13 | GUIDEBOOK ON CLIMATE SCENARIOS 1.5 CLIMATE SIMULATIONS Climate simulations are the end product of climate models.\n","4570:  As discussed earlier, each climate model has its own set of equations to represent the climate system.\n","4571:  To obtain a climate simulation, many different inputs are required in a climate model, such as a detailed portrait of the Earth_s surface including geophysical data (soil types, types of vegetation, continental contours, location and bathymetry of large bodies of water, description of the topography, etc.).\n","4572:  In addition, as addressed previously, emission scenarios are a main driver to climate models in climate change studies.\n","4573:  Different climate simulations are obtained as each climate model responds differently to greenhouse gas emissions scenarios, and hence will produce a different future climate (also see Box on Members).\n","4574:  It is important to understand that none of these future climates should be considered a prediction: all the future climates projected by different climate models with different GHG forcing scenarios should be considered equally plausible.\n","4575:  The time span of a simulation can range from a few years to thousands of years, both for the past and future periods (Figure 7).\n","4576:  The length of time over which climate models are run to produce simulations differs from one climate center to another but can range for example from 1850 or 1900 to 2100 or even 2300 (see example of Figure 7).\n","4577:  Each simulation is computed iteratively at different time intervals.\n","4579:  The length of the time step defines the temporal resolution, which is typically 5 to 20 minutes.\n","4580:  At each time step and at each point on the calculation grid (horizontal and vertical level), the numerical solution of the equations gives the values of the variables included in the basic equations, along with several others derived from physical parameterizations.\n","4581:  Thus, a climate simulation contains more than one hundred descriptive climate variables (temperature, winds, barometric pressure, rainfall, snow, etc.\n","4582:  ), which should all be physically consistent with one another from one point on the grid to another and also in time.\n","4584:  A climate simulation is therefore an imperfect numerical representation of the meteorology that could have occurred over the globe, based on the assumption that the simulation of the natural variability is close to the real one.\n","4585:  This means that even if we have observations of greenhouse gases emissions for the past and we run a climate model using those observations as input, the resulting simulation will give a response that is different from what is recorded at meteorological stations.\n","4586:  Furthermore, due to the chaotic nature of the climate system and climate model sensitivity to things such as initial conditions at the start of a simulation, even a _perfect_ climate model would not reproduce the succession or timing of observed historical meteorological events, and the best we can expect is that the model reproduces the statistical properties (mean, variance, inter-annual variability, etc.)\n","4587:  of the observed records.\n","4589:  This will mean for example, that some models may always yield temperatures that are slightly colder on average than the other models, while some may always project more precipitation than others.\n","4590:  Furthermore, a model_s bias is not necessarily equal for all parts of the globe, and can vary for different regions.\n","4591:  It is important to consider this bias when calculating climate change scenarios.\n","4593:  GUIDEBOOK ON CLIMATE SCENARIOS | 14 Figure 7 | Time

7).\n","4599:  They therefore represent the plausible evolution of different climate variables that describe the climate system over several decades to centuries under different emissions scenarios.\n","4600:  The first year of this future period is the year that corresponds to the first year when emissions scenarios are used to run climate models changes, as opposed to observed GHG emissions.\n","4601:  Ensemble members It is possible to produce a large ensemble of simulations, or of plausible climate outcomes by running numerous models with different emissions scenarios.\n","4602:  A model can also be run multiple times with the same RCP with slight perturbations in the initial conditions, for example by changing the start date of the simulation to obtain what are called ensemble members.\n","4603:  Because of the chaotic nature of the climate system, these small changes will yield different responses (succession of meteorological events) and thus slightly different climate projection values.\n","4604:  GUIDEBOOK ON CLIMATE SCENARIOS | 16 1.6.1 COUPLED MODEL INTERCOMPARAISON PROJECT (CMIP) As discussed above, there are numerous climate modeling centers around the world, each developing their own climate model and there are currently four plausible emissions scenarios to consider when producing climate simulations.\n","4605:  Obtaining such a simulation, i.e.\n","4606:  running one model with one RCP for example, is computationally intensive and even with today_s high performance super computers, it can take up to several months to run a global model over the entire globe for a meaningful simulation period, say 1850 to 2100.\n","4607:  Consequently, it would be impractical, if not impossible, for each climate modeling center to run all available models with all available RCPs.\n","4608:  Therefore, to obtain a common frame of simulations and the largest possible ensemble, the modeling centers have agreed to run their own models with the different RCPs and to make the resulting simulations available to the rest of the climate community.\n","4609:  This collaboration is done through an initiative called the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP).\n","4610:  Through a web interface, it is possible to download different simulations from different modeling centers that are part of this project in order to obtain a large ensemble of simulations.\n","4611:  The CMIP ensemble forms the backbone of the results presented in the IPCC reports.\n","4612:  As models and emissions scenarios are updated, so is the collection of simulations, also known as the ensemble, made available through CMIP.\n","4613:  Currently, the scientific community is using the fifth ensemble, called CMIP5.\n","4614:  This newest generation of participating models are run using the RCPs whereas simulations made available from the previous CMIP3 used the SRES scenarios.\n","4615:  CMIP5 simulations CMIP5 vs CMIP3 are generally executed at a higher spatial resolution and the models typically have a more complete representation of physical parameterizations (particularly of biophysical processes such as the carbon-cycle) than their predecessors.\n","4616:  It is generally expected that the new generation of models will provide a better representation of the climate; however, not all models have evolved equally24.\n","4617:  It is worth mentioning that this development process is always on-going.\n","4618:  Climate centers are currently developing a CMIP6 ensemble, which will be the basis of the next IPCC report.\n","4620:  Nonetheless, recent studies have shown that comparisons of model means of temperature and precipitation change are similar in CMIP3 and CMIP5 for climate projections with similar forcing25.\n","4621:  Yet, the CMIP5 ensemble compares more favourably with observations for past climate simulations (23,26_28).\n","4622:  These conclusions should reassure users that climate information provided using CMIP3 models remains valid and robust even if there is now a gradual shift towards use of CMIP5 model results.\n","4623:  The conclusions also support the argument that an ensemble of models should be used when making decisions, as it has been shown that any single model chosen from the ensemble scores lower than the entire ensemble when multiple variables are validated against observations29.\n","4624:  In other words, the mean of the simulation ensemble for the past climate is generally closer to the observed values than any given individual simulation.\n","4625:  It is generally believed that recent climate model simulations are likely to be more reliable than those of an earlier generation of models (vintage).\n","4626:  They are, after all, based on more recent knowledge and incorporate more processes and feedbacks.\n","4627:  However, the differences between the two vintages are not always very distinct.\n","4628:  Consequently, information provided with an older vintage remains valid when a new vintage is produced.\n","4629:  Indeed, impacts studies conducted with an older ensemble should not be automatically disregarded when new simulations are made available.\n","4630:  As such, the information in this guide is often based on the newest generation of models (from the CMIP5 ensemble), but older simulations (from the CMIP3 ensemble) are also presented in some cases.\n","4631:  The focus of the guide is on the interpretation of the climate information, and hence depends very little on the particular generation of models or scenarios that were used.\n","4632:  17 | GUIDEBOOK ON CLIMATE SCENARIOS 1.7 SOURCES OF UNCERTAINTY IN CLIMATE PROJECTIONS Climate projection uncertainties stem from three main sources: natural variability in the climate, climate model structural inaccuracies, and the future trajectories of greenhouse gas emissions30_32.\n","4633:  As seen previously, the evolution of the climate is influenced by important unpredictable natural fluctuations that occur even without any change in greenhouse gases concentration.\n","4634:  In addition, the models are simulating their own climate, which differs from reality (more or less, depending on the model, see Box on Model Bias) and each models can differ to a certain degree in its response to greenhouse gas emissions.\n","4635:  Finally, the evolution of greenhouse gas emissions is also uncertain and it is not possible at this time, to determine which, if any, of the four RCP trajectories will be realized.\n","4636:  important since this variability can be in opposition, at least for a few decades, to the longer-term trends that are associated with anthropogenic climate change (Figure 3).\n","4637:  It may take several decades before the climate _signal_ emerges from the _noise_ of year-to-year variability.\n","4638:  Consequently, over short time scales, the choice of the emissions scenarios is relatively unimportant (red circle, Figure 8).\n","4639:  This is perhaps surprising but it takes approximately 30 years for any difference between current emissions scenarios to have an appreciable impact on the climate3,31.\n","4640:  For example, on Figure 8, one can notice that the coloured line start to diverge around 2030 and that a clearer distinction can be made among the different scenarios by 2050.\n","4641:  The relative importance of each source of uncertainty depends on the timescale considered.\n","4642:  Over a timescale of a few decades, the natural variability in the climate is the most important source of uncertainty and can even hide the climate change signal over the short term.\n","4643:  This is extremely However, over longer time horizons, the choice of the emission scenario becomes very important (coloured envelopes on Figure 8), while the model uncertainty remains fairly large irrespective of the timescale over which decisions are made.\n","4644:  These patterns have been shown to be consistent for both global and regional analysis of the uncertainties30,32_35.\n","4645:  Figure 8 | Title as Figure 7.\n","4646:  The red circle highlights the time period prior to 2050 where models run with all four RCPs project similar changes in global surface temperatures.\n","4647:  Source: IPCC 201319 GUIDEBOOK ON CLIMATE SCENARIOS | 18 In many cases, stakeholders already make decisions in the face of some uncertainty since they have to manage variability in local weather and climate over the short-term, as well as uncertainties in many other areas of their workflows and decision-making.\n","4648:  Consequently, the uncertainty in climate projections need not be a deterrent from making decisions over a longer time scale.\n","4649:  What is important is to understand what the main sources of uncertainty are and how their relative importance changes over time.\n","4650:  Within a decision- making framework, the timescale of the planning horizon must be considered in order to weigh the importance of the different sources of uncertainty (Table 2).\n","4651:  The planning horizon will also greatly impact the type of climate information that would be most appropriate.\n","4652:  Table 2 | The relative importance of the three sources of uncertainties in climate projections over time.\n","4653:  Planning horizon Short term (<30 years) Medium term (30-50

even for short-term objectives, a long-term vision is necessary.\n","4655:  The importance of relying on an iterative process of revisiting climate projections and re-evaluating adaptation measures

emissions scenario should be given particular consideration.\n","4657:  Over these horizons, the climate change signal is stronger than the variability in the climate but it is heavily influenced by which emission scenario is chosen.\n","4658:  Given the high level of uncertainty associated with the evolution of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, decisions should consider all plausible futures.\n","4660:  However, it is not possible for climate service providers to pick such a climate change scenario.\n","4661:  The reasons why this cannot be done reside in the intrinsic properties of climate models, climate simulation, and the emissions scenarios outlined above.\n","4662:  All together, they provide a plausible representation of what the real world is and of what the climate may become given the current state of knowledge.\n","4664:  It is very difficult to test which model is the best as they all possess different strengths and weaknesses.\n","4665:  As stated previously, models have biases and therefore produce slightly different results.\n","4666:  There is no climate model that is always able to give the best results for all variables for all seasons over all regions.\n","4667:  Furthermore, it is not possible to determine at this time which scenario of future greenhouse gas emissions will be closest to reality.\n","4668:  Therefore, when providing climate information, the most prudent advice is to consider a simulation ensemble, or a large number of simulations in the decision-making process.\n","4669:  In other words, it is best to take into account an ensemble that includes both the best and worst case scenarios.\n","4670:  However, deciding on the exact number of simulations that should be used is not straightforward.\n","4671:  Indeed, general guidelines suggest that users should obtain climate projections based on as many simulations that represent as many models and emission scenarios as possible36 but the term _large ensemble_ remains vague.\n","4672:  Ultimately, the choice of the number of simulations to be considered for a given project will be influenced by the time and resources available.\n","4673:  The expertise of a climate service provider may prove valuable in helping the decision-maker choose an appropriate number.\n","4674:  Different statistical techniques can serve to select a limited number of simulations that best represent the properties of the entire available simulation ensemble.\n","4675:  The goal is to ensure that the chosen simulations adequately represent the full range of possible future conditions of the indices of interest37.\n","4676:  One such technique is a cluster analysis38.\n","4677:  Briefly, this method consists of first selecting the climate variables that are of interest for a particular project.\n","4678:  Next, for each simulation, the variables are computed for the reference period and for the future horizon and the difference between the two values is calculated (i.e.\n","4679:  the climatic change).\n","4680:  The differences are then standardized and an algorithm can be used to calculate the distances between all the simulations in a multi-dimensional space (the dimensions correspond to the climate variables chosen).\n","4681:  Figure 9 illustrates an example, and highlights the outcome of maximizing the range in the response (i.e.\n","4682:  the uncertainty) while minimizing the number of simulations chosen.\n","4683:  The figure shows the number of simulations needed to adequately cover the range of

Logan (Ouranos) Limitations of selection An important point to remember is that selections of a few representative simulations out of a range of available outputs are invariably based on a limited number of climate indices over a given temporal window (annual temperature and precipitation for example).\n","4695:  They may therefore not be representative of other indices over different temporal timescales (monthly snow cover for example).\n","4696:  In other words, the selection is only valid for the indices and timescales that were used to choose the scenarios in the first place.\n","4697:  21 | GUIDEBOOK ON CLIMATE SCENARIOS 1.9 DOWNSCALING TECHNIQUES GCMs simulate the evolution of the climate system over the entire planet, with a horizontal resolution of around one hundred to three hundred kilometres (left panel on Figure 11), for periods that can reach thousands of years.\n","4698:  The calculation time required to simulate the global climate of required length at a finer resolution of a few kilometres, or even finer, is generally not within the reach of even today_s fastest computers.\n","4699:  However, there is an increasing demand by the user community to obtain climate projections at a finer scale (right panel on Figure 11).\n","4700:  Figure 11 | Example of the difference in grid cell size between a global climate models (left panel) with a resolution of approximately 200 km and information that has been downscaled to a 45 km grid cell (right panel).\n","4701:  Source: T. Logan (Ouranos) GUIDEBOOK ON CLIMATE SCENARIOS | 22 Techniques to produce climate information at a finer resolution, referred to as downscaling techniques (Figure 12) fall into two categories, namely dynamical and statistical downscaling (see39).\n","4702:  Dynamical downscaling: This approach relies on the use of regional climate models (RCMs) which, like the GCMs, are based on a realistic representation of the physical laws that affect the climate system.\n","4703:  Such models are used to refine the horizontal resolution of the climate in a selected region of the globe.\n","4704:  Their finer spatial resolution (typically 10 to 50 km) means they can develop more detailed characteristics of climate because they benefit from a much more precise representation of land surface features (such as mountains, coastal contours, or the presence of lakes and rivers).\n","4705:  To stay linked with the global climate, an RCM has to be supplied at its periphery with large-scale variables from a driving model, which is generally a GCM.\n","4706:  Although costly in terms of computing time, this downscaling technique ensures consistency in time and space of climate variables.\n","4707:  In addition, climate models like RCMs and GCMs have the capacity to simulate the interactions among greenhouse gases and aerosols with other components of the climate system, which will improve their capacity to reproduce the climate system.\n","4708:  Statistical downscaling: This approach is based on the premise that the characteristics of local observed climate can be derived from a series of large-scale global climate variables (predictors).\n","4709:  It can involve various techniques (multiple regressions, stochastic generators, neural networks), which are used to establish statistical relationships between observed local conditions and predictors obtained using data from the recent climate (e.g.\n","4710:  The statistical downscaling of a GCM simulation relies on the hypothesis that the statistical relationships established for the recent past will remain the same for the future.\n","4711:  In the context of climate change, this hypothesis is problematic because climate is not stationary and the validity of the assumption is difficult to test.\n","4712:  Moreover, downscaling several climate variables simultaneously still presents a challenge.\n","4713:  Consequently, climate variables are often processed separately, resulting in a possible decline of spatiotemporal consistency.\n","4714:  Nonetheless, statistical downscaling is a relatively inexpensive and quick approach compared to dynamical downscaling.\n","4715:  It is important to mention that statistical downscaling may also be applied to already higher resolution RCM data.\n","4716:  Figure 12 | Comparison between dynamical and statistical downscaling techniques.\n","4717:  Source: Ouranos 23 | GUIDEBOOK ON CLIMATE SCENARIOS 1.9.1 WHEN IS DOWNSCALING NECESSARY The idea that finer resolution climate data is better can be attractive; however, downscaling will not necessarily yield more useful information to the decision-maker.\n","4718:  Moreover, increased model resolution does not guarantee superior model performance for all variables and all time-scales.\n","4719:  Arguably, many adaptation strategies will be developed for a relatively small area (local scale), which may therefore require finer resolution climate information.\n","4720:  However, the mean change projected from a GCM over a 200 km grid cell may not be very different from what is projected once the data are downscaled to a smaller grid cell (from either dynamical or statistical downscaling), particularly given the uncertainties around the model ensemble projections.\n","4721:  In other words, downscaling may improve the accuracy of some of the information given, but not for all variables over all time periods.\n","4722:  Before deciding on the necessity and added- value of downscaled information, the climate variable of interest and the landscape features of the region of interest must be analyzed.\n","4723:  Surface characteristics like topography, coastlines or the vicinity of a body of water do not have the same effect on the various climate variables and this influence could also vary from one season to another.\n","4724:  For instance, air surface temperature is generally uniform over larger regions of flat terrain, but changes abruptly by the seashore.\n","4725:  On the other hand, precipitation generally tends to be more variable in space.\n","4726:  Thus, in the latter case, the choice of reverting to a dynamical downscaling technique may be preferable but it might not be necessary for someone interested in the temperature over a large region.\n","4727:  In addition, the added time needed to resolve the information at a finer scale is non-negligible and should be accounted for (in deciding if downscaling is necessary).\n","4728:  Downscaling and bias correction (post-processing) There is often some confusion in separating downscaling and bias correction concepts.\n","4730:  However, many statistical downscaling methods often involve a bias-correction step.\n","4731:  In addition, while dynamical downscaling in and of itself does not involve any form of bias correction, the outputs from regional climate models are at times bias corrected.\n","4732:  Hence, users often wrongly assume that bias correction and downscaling are one and the same.\n","4733:  GUIDEBOOK ON CLIMATE SCENARIOS | 24 1.9.2 DYNAMICAL OR STATISTICAL DOWNSCALING The choice of downscaling method to use is not a simple one.\n","4735:  First, with statistical downscaling techniques, each climate variable treated individually, which may result in the physical coherence between the variables being broken.\n","4736:  In other words, the mathematical representation of the physics behind the climate that are present in a global climate model may no longer hold true.\n","4737:  Some climate variables may be more sensitive than others to this issue.\n","4738:  is generally In addition, statistical downscaling is based on statistical relationships between the local observations of a variable of interest and other coarser resolution climate variables used as predictors.\n","4740:  In addition, these statistical relationships are assumed to be constant (or stationary) over time which may not be true in a changing climate.\n","4741:  This assumption may not be too problematic for some variables for shorter term projections but the uncertainty is greater for projections for the end of the century.\n","4742:  far outweighs Finally, the number of global climate model simulations the number of regional climate model simulations that have currently been produced over North America.\n","4743:  Consequently, a much larger number of projections can be provided by statistically downscaling GCM simulation results.\n","4744:  If a large ensemble of projections is important to the study at hand, then statistical downscaling could be the preferred choice.\n","4745:  If, on the other hand, a smaller _ but carefully chosen _simulation sample suffices, then dynamical downscaling could be used.\n","4746:  The factors listed above highlight the complexity in choosing, first whether to downscale at all, and second, which method to use.\n","4747:  There is not a sole correct answer here and ultimately the selection will depend on the objectives and resources of the project.\n","4748:  Table 3 | Comparison of the advantages and limitations of both dynamical and statistical downscaling.\n","4749:  Dynamical Statistical _ Reproduces more detailed characteristics of the climate _ Consistency in time and space

representations of the real world and often present a bias in their estimate of climate variables.\n","4751:  This is one of the main reasons why climate simulations should never be compared directly with observations.\n","4753:  This post-processing step is often required in order to transform raw, or even downscaled, climate model outputs into climate information that is better suited for users.\n","4754:  Model bias is not an issue (and therefore does not need to be corrected) when simply calculating the relative changes between a future horizon and the reference horizon from the same simulation (i.e.\n","4755:  coming from the same model with the same emissions scenario).\n","4756:  Indeed, the bias in the models is generally assumed to be the same in the reference and future simulated data and it therefore cancelled out when calculating the relative change, or the delta, between the two periods.\n","4757:  However, post-processing becomes necessary when calculating future simulated values, in other words when applying the change projected by the model to the observations, the biases become relevant and must be corrected.\n","4758:  This is particularly important for threshold values, which are highly susceptible to small changes.\n","4759:  For example, if a model has a warm bias compared to the observations, the likelihood of reaching a warm temperature threshold (for example days with an average temperature above 30_C) will be amplified in the simulated data compared to the real world.\n","4760:  Consequently, if the bias is not removed, a decision- maker might conclude that, in the future, there will be more days with an average temperature above 30_C, when this is in fact simply an artifact of the model bias.\n","4761:  There is a large number of post-processing techniques available and it is far beyond the scope of this guidebook to review them in detail40,41.\n","4762:  However, two simple methods are presented as examples to highlight the main objectives and general methodologies of post-processing methods.\n","4763:  Note that the main assumption made with post- processing is that biases are (almost) identical for the reference period and the future period, which may not be the case.\n","4764:  In addition, as mentioned previously post-processing can be used independently from, or in combination with downscaling techniques, which often results in some confusion between the two concepts.\n","4765:  An important warning regarding post-processing technique must be raised.\n","4766:  These techniques strongly rely on the observation network, and thus the only variables that can be post-processed are those for which observations are available.\n","4767:  In places such as the USA, or much of Europe, the high- density network generally provides a sufficiently high number of climate stations in different types of location, with the possible exclusion of high mountains, to build an adequate observational dataset for some variables, namely temperature and / or precipitation.\n","4768:  In Canada, particularly in the north, the station density is very low and strongly biased as most of the stations are located along the coastline and in valleys.\n","4770:  Such a coarse representation of reality is also present in gridded observational datasets, which are created from the interpolation of station data to fill regions where there are none.\n","4771:  The bottom line is that post- processing is only as good as the observations that are used to conduct it, and given the limitations just outlined here, caution is often advised.\n","4772:  GUIDEBOOK ON CLIMATE SCENARIOS | 26 1.10.1 DELTA/SCALING METHOD (ALSO CALLED THE PERTURBATION METHOD) This method involves a perturbation of the observed of

Logan (Ouranos) It is important to remember that post-processing techniques (see section 1.10) are often used to re- move some of the bias in climate simulations in order to better match simulation values to true observed values.\n","4813:  However, the match is never perfect and so climate scenarios should still be calculated using simulated past and future values, even if simulations have been bias corrected.\n","4814:  31 | GUIDEBOOK ON CLIMATE SCENARIOS CHAPTER TWO CATEGORIZING CLIMATE INFORMATION Part of the challenge in incorporating climate information into an adaptation framework or into a decision- making process is deciding what type of climate information is needed.\n","4815:  Indeed, while the previous chapter explained many of the underlying climate science concepts, it is just as important for a decision-maker to understand the various climate information products that can be used to deliver that information.\n","4816:  In order to familiarize decision-makers with climate information and its different uses, this chapter presents a simple categorization framework that divides climate information into three levels: basic, intermediate, and detailed information.\n","4817:  The choice of the most appropriate climate information is often made in collaboration with climate service providers.\n","4818:  The goal here is to help decision-makers better evaluate their climate information needs.\n","4819:  Two main concepts are addressed here: climate information categories, which reflect the climate data needed and climate information formats, which reflect the way the data is presented.\n","4821:  The categories are based on a few key criteria that are specifically related to the type of climate information that is required.\n","4822:  These criteria are shown in Figure 16.\n","4823:  The categories are meant to separate climate information into three very broad complexity levels, from information that is fairly simple to prepare and understand to information that is more complex to produce and often more difficult to understand and where the uncertainties are more important.\n","4824:  Figure 16 | Key criteria used to evaluate the climate information needs of decision-makers (adapted from Lu 200643).\n","4825:  Categories and user type Climate information categories do not reflect a type of decision-maker but rather reflect the reason why the information is required, and the specifics of the climate data itself.\n","4826:  This implies that users that may be very familiar with climate information may, at times, only require basic information, while users unfamiliar with climate information may require detailed information.\n","4827:  GUIDEBOOK ON CLIMATE SCENARIOS | 34 It is important to note that all criteria presented in Figure 16 can be equally important in influencing the classification outcome.\n","4828:  Thus, it is possible that evaluating the impacts of climate change (which is an example of evaluating the purpose of the information) on a given species is not automatically part of the intermediate needs category, as it will also depend, for example, on the climate variables needed.\n","4829:  By the same token, evaluating adaptation options is not, de facto, part of the detailed category.\n","4830:  In addition, the categories are presented here as well-defined entities but in fact they represent a gradient of increasing complexity in the climate data requested and/or produced.\n","4831:  Examples of answers to each of the questions and how they can be associated with one category are presented in Table 4.\n","4832:  Table 4 | Overview of three climate information categories, basic, intermediate, and detailed.\n","4833:  CATEGORY BASIC EXAMPLE OF PURPOSE To

increase in the spatial and temporal resolution, increase in the uncertainties associated with information, increase in amount of data Note that the goal is not necessarily to _advance_ from one category to the next but simply to choose the most appropriate category for a given purpose.\n","4837:  For some users, there will be a progression in the type of information they require based on their current knowledge and on the types of decisions they have to make over time.\n","4838:  However, for others, basic climate information will suffice to inform fairly complex decisions.\n","4839:  To further help users visualize and evaluate their own climate information needs, the criteria described above have been used to develop a decision-tree (Figure 17) that is in essence a roadmap to producing cli- mate information.\n","4840:  By answering the roadmap questions, users are guided to one of three broad categories of climate information: basic, intermediate, and detailed.\n","4841:

CLIMATE INFORMATION FORMATS As stated above, climate information categories evaluate the general level of information complexity required by users.\n","4851:  However, the way in which the information is presented may be equally as important.\n","4852:  Proper formatting of the information may ensure the data is not only useful but becomes more usable.\n","4853:  User backgrounds and areas of expertise will play a large role in determining the optimal format.\n","4854:  In other words, the same climate information can be presented differently depending on expertise or preference.\n","4855:  The term format is used to refer to the way in which the information is presented, or the layout of the information.\n","4856:  For example, the projected changes in annual temperature over Canada for the horizon 2050 (the climate information) can be communicated using a table, or a map, or a regression line (the format).\n","4857:  The formats presented in the guidebook have been separated into the three climate information categories.\n","4858:  However, just as it was the case for the categories, the formats also represent a gradient from very simple representations of climate data to more complex visuals.\n","4859:  It can be difficult at times to clearly associate them with one specific category.\n","4860:  More importantly, the climate data requested may be complex and hence fall into the detailed category, but the way the information must be presented may need to be simplified.\n","4862:  37 | GUIDEBOOK ON CLIMATE SCENARIOS CHAPTER THREE CATALOGUE OF CLIMATE INFORMATION FORMATS The goal of this section is to present how climate information can be tailored to the audience.\n","4863:  In other words, the same climate information (e.g.\n","4864:  past trends or projected future changes) can be presented using different formats.\n","4865:  For example, projected changes in temperatures can be presented using a synthesis table (e.g.\n","4866:  p.43), a map (e.g.\n","4867:  p.48), or using a graph that plots the evolution of the change over time (e.g.\n","4868:  The objective of this chapter is to present as many of the most commonly used formats as possible (Table 5).\n","4869:  However, new formats are continually being developed by climate service providers and particular formats can always be created to meet the preferences of decision-makers or the particularities of a project.\n","4870:  In order to increase the capacity of decision-makers to critically evaluate the information that is provided to them, all figures, graphs and maps presented in this section are accompanied by explanations that describe: 1) what climate information is presented and how should it be interpreted, 2) how the figure is constructed and 3) what are the limitations/caveats/possible ways to misinterpret the information.\n","4871:  In addition, the use of coloured font will remind the reader that additional information on key climate science concepts can be found in Chapter 1.\n","4872:  Table 5 | Climate information formats associated with each of the three climate information categories.\n","4873:  CATEGORY BASIC TYPE OF CLIMATE INFORMATION

highlight how past and future climate information can be tailored using varying formats.\n","4878:  From the simplest format to the slightly more complex, they are: _ _ _ _ Synthesis table _ used to

B1).\n","4882:  Source: Information was taken from PCIC website (http://www.pacifi cclimate.org/analysis-tools/plan2adapt) 43 | GUIDEBOOK ON CLIMATE SCENARIOS What climate information is presented and how should it be interpreted?\n","4883:  Table 6 shows projected changes (deltas) in mean temperature, precipitation, growing degree-days and frost-free days for the horizon 2050 (2041- 2070) compared to the reference period 1961- 1990 for the province of British Columbia.\n","4885:  On the other hand, the median projection for summer precipitation shows a slight decrease.\n","4886:  The range in the values highlights that there can be large differences among all the simulations used.\n","4887:  For example, one simulation projects increases as low as +179 degree-days per year while another projects values of +429 degree-days per year.\n","4888:  How is the table constructed?\n","4889:  Synthesis tables can summarize historical trends or projected changes (such as the example given here) for a given future time horizon and region of interest, and can be expressed for different time periods (monthly, seasonal, or annual).\n","4890:  The summary can be done for any area of interest, such as global, provincial, or regional scales.\n","4891:  Projected changes are calculated as the change between the 2050 horizon (2041-2070) and the 1961-1990 reference period using 15 global climate models with two SRES emission scenarios.\n","4892:  An important point here is that, as shown in section 1.11.2, the changes represent the difference between simulated future values and simulated reference values.\n","4893:  In other words, the changes do not represent the difference between a model simulation and observed climate normals (or reference) values but rather the difference within a simulation.\n","4894:  In the table presented here, the changes in the four climatic variables are expressed as the median change and the spread in the simulation ensemble.\n","4895:  The ensemble median is a mid- point value of all simulations used to calculate the changes (30 in this case), while the range represents the 10th and 90th percentiles of all values.\n","4896:  The range in values from the different models is generally referred to as the uncertainty in the models, although it is made up of more than just differences between models.\n","4897:  important What are the limitations/caveats/possible ways to misinterpret the information?\n","4898:  The main limitation of this information resides in the fact that the changes are often estimated over large areas, and may therefore not represent potentially local differences.\n","4899:  For example, in this particular case, the values are given for all of British Columbia, a province with large topographic relief in some regions.\n","4900:  Given the importance of topographic features of this province, it is easy to imagine that the _average_ changes given in the table may not adequately represent all environments found in British Columbia.\n","4901:  In addition, it is important to remember that while the changes are projected over the 2050 horizon, the actual change may be gradual and therefore not felt exactly during the year 2050.\n","4902:  In addition, the absence of changes at the annual scale could mean that there are no changes at all, or that changes during one season offset changes in another.\n","4903:  More importantly, because of the natural variability in the climate, there may be individual years (or a series of consecutive years) where the annual change is in opposition to the average change calculated over the 30-year period (2041- 2070).\n","4904:  In other words, while the table presents an in average annual temperatures compared to the reference period, it quite likely that some years will show annual temperatures that are lower than what has been experienced on average over the reference period.\n","4905:  increase

Logan, Ouranos 49 | GUIDEBOOK ON CLIMATE SCENARIOS What climate information is presented and how should it be interpreted?\n","4970:  The top figure shows projected changes in annual mean temperature across the globe for the horizon 2081-2100 in comparison to the reference period 1986-2005, for RCPs 2.6 and 8.5, as published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in their latest assessment report, published in 201319.\n","4971:  The figure suggests that the Arctic region will warm more rapidly than the global mean, and that mean warming over land will be larger than over the ocean.\n","4972:  The bottom figure also presents projected changes in mean annual temperature but for a smaller domain, namely across Canada, for the horizon 2080 (2071-2100) in comparison with the reference period 1971-2000.\n","4973:  Median changes in annual temperature for the 2080 horizon range from 2.5_C to 5_C, while the 10th and 90th percentiles suggest changes as low as 1_C and as high as 8_C (not in the same locations however).\n","4974:  The greatest changes are expected to occur in Northern regions.\n","4975:  How is the figure constructed?\n","4976:  The information presented in these figures is essentially the same as the information given in synthesis tables except that the expected changes are presented as maps, usually based on gridded data.\n","4977:  The changes are calculated for a specific future horizon by comparing it to the reference period (this is often referred to as the change-field method).\n","4978:  The difference is calculated for each polygon (or model grid cell) and for all climate simulations that have been chosen.\n","4979:  The changes can be calculated for any given time frame, such as monthly, seasonal or annual changes (as is the case here).\n","4980:  In both figures, a large number of models were used to compute the changes.\n","4981:  In Figure A, 32 models from the CMIP5 ensemble were used with RCP2.6 and 39 CMIP5 models with RCP8.5.\n","4982:  For Figure B, the changes or deltas were obtained using 137 global model simulations from the CMIP3 using 3 SRES emissions scenarios (A2, A1b, B1).\n","4983:  The changes are subsequently plotted over a common grid.\n","4984:  Note that the size of the polygons is generally driven by the resolution of the climate models used.\n","4985:  For example, global climate models typically have a resolution of approximately 200- 300 km whereas regional climate models have a resolution of approximately 45 km and less.\n","4986:  To synthesize the outputs from all the simulations used, a mean (as in the top Figure) or a median (as in the bottom Figure) of the ensemble is often shown.\n","4987:  As with the synthesis table, the range in the simulations, which gives an estimate of the uncertainty in the projections, should also be represented.\n","4988:  In Figure A (globe), this is done by the use of hatching and stippling that indicate whether the multi-model mean presented on the figure is small or large in comparison with the natural variability.\n","4989:  In Figure B (Canada), this is done by giving not only the median value of the simulation ensemble (left panel) but also giving complementary maps that show the range in the simulations, expressed by the 10th and 90th percentiles.\n","4990:  The choice of the percentiles is arbitrary, and could potentially take on any value of choice, such as 25th and 75th percentiles for example.\n","4992:  While such figures point to the fact that temperatures are increasing across large scales, they also highlight the fact that not all regions will experience the same increase.\n","4993:  Consequently, this type of climate information may be useful to raise the awareness of stakeholders to climate change.\n","4994:  However, it does not detail how local changes may differ significantly from this global or national picture.\n","4995:  Consequently, using such coarse projections implies that the local relevance of adaptation decisions is less certain.\n","4996:  In addition, the values shown on such figures give the amount of change that is estimated by the models.\n","4997:  However, in order to appreciate how important that change may be, it is often necessary to combine this information with climate normals, which give users a baseline value upon which to evaluate the projected changes.\n","4998:  Similarly, climate trends can provide additional context to aid with the interpretation of the magnitude of future changes.\n","4999:  GUIDEBOOK ON CLIMATE SCENARIOS | 50 INTERMEDIATE CATEGORY This category only includes information about projected future climate changes.\n","5000:  The climate information produced for this category often tends to be for a more specific spatial scale than the information produced in the basic category.\n","5001:  Consequently, the climate information is increasingly tailored to suit the specific needs of users.\n","5002:  The examples shown here will help users familiarize themselves with the interpretation of the different formats.\n","5003:  Five examples are presented to highlight how climate information can be tailored using varying levels of complexity.\n","5004:  From the simplest format to the most complex, they are: _ _ Spatial analogues _ used to present where the historical climate will be in the

reveals that while there is definitely a projected increase in growing degree-days, there is also a widening of the grey envelope (uncertainty) into the future.\n","5129:  An important point is that the grey envelope contains all sources of uncertainty, not just the inter-annual variability.\n","5130:  For example, the widening of the envelope could lead a user to mistakenly conclude that in the future, the simulations project both warmer (centered approximately in the middle of the envelope) and an increased variability between individual years (inter-annual variability).\n","5131:  However, this is not how the figure should be interpreted.\n","5132:  The width of the grey envelope for the future horizons is in fact the result of multiple sources of uncertainty, not only inter-annual natural variability, but also uncertainty between the different SRES families (i.e.\n","5133:  more or less GHGs in the atmosphere), as well as uncertainties in climate model sensitivity (i.e.\n","5134:  how sensitive different climate models are to a given increase in GHG concentrations).\n","5135:  It is therefore false to assume that the wider grey envelope for future horizons solely represents greater inter-annual variability, as represented by the grey envelope for the reference period.\n","5136:  In order to better understand whether there is indeed an increase in the

presented by the formats given in the guidebook, but with a clear understanding that the uncertainties for these variables are important.\n","5223:  Nonetheless, the availability of observations for the climate variables identified in Table 7 is increasing along with the understanding of the processes generating them.\n","5224:  Consequently, it is expected that our confidence in climate model projections for these lesser known variables will likely increase in the near future.\n","5225:  _ The second is to rely on synthetic scenarios (also often called _what-if_ scenarios), where hypothetical futures are derived based on the best available information.\n","5226:  Very simply, synthetic scenarios are created by adjusting climate elements incrementally by arbitrary amounts into the future, based on expert judg- ment.\n","5227:  The way in which they are adjusted should be consistent with either GCM outputs or historical climate data3.\n","5228:  They can be constructed for climate variables for which we have a high degree of confi- dence (such as temperature for example) but where resources to run climate models are limited.\n","5229:  In such cases, the scenarios will allow a rapid first evaluation of the potential sensitivity of a system.\n","5230:  They are particularly useful, however, for cases where the climate index of interest is not well understood at this time or is not well represented by climate models.\n","5231:  In such cases, climate scientists develop hypothetical futures based on the best available information.\n","5232:  GUIDEBOOK ON CLIMATE

scenarios presented in Table 8, namely a discharge equivalent to Q100 + 2000m3/s.\n","5240:  How is the table/figure constructed?\n","5241:  Nine synthetic scenarios of future discharge values were used to simulate a range of flooding events (Table 8).\n","5242:  The discharges used were based on hydrological modelling of measured discharge values for the river.\n","5243:  Plausible scenarios of increases in discharge were based on both historical discharge values and expert opinions by hydrologists working on the project.\n","5244:  Examples of simulated values were: Q2 (maximum discharge with a 2 year return period), Q100 (discharge with a 100 year return), and Q100 + 2000m3/s.\n","5245:  Once the scenarios were developed, they were used to project water levels on a digital elevation map of the area of interest.\n","5246:  The goal was to model different discharge overflow scenarios in order to identify areas most likely to be submerged (potential flood zones).\n","5247:  These scenarios allowed the development of a map of the potential flood zones (e.g.\n","5248:  Figure 28) and ultimately permitted a first evaluation of the sensitivity of the populations to increases in

resources), and they are typically easy to use and understand.\n","5253:  In this case, mapping flood zones needed to be modeled into the future and while the extent of flooding is obviously highly dependent on the discharge of the river, this river is regulated and so water discharge is a complex variable to simulate.\n","5254:  This complexity is heightened by climate change.\n","5255:  Indeed, while precipitation will explain a large portion of the variability in the discharge, other factors which are more difficult to model may also play a role, such as water uptake from the river upstream of the region of interest and other management decisions regarding flow regulations for example.\n","5256:  The decision to use what-if scenarios therefore allowed a first evaluation of potential vulnerabilities of populations along this river.\n","5257:  important disadvantage However, an is that synthetic scenarios may not be physically plausible and may not represent the physical properties of the climate system.\n","5258:  For example, some of the future discharge values used may be very large compared to what can actually occur.\n","5259:  Synthetic scenarios must therefore be constructed with care with the help of experts and their underlying assumptions must clearly be outlined.\n","5260:  GUIDEBOOK ON CLIMATE SCENARIOS | 72 CHAPTER FOUR DECISION MAKING USING CLIMATE INFORMATION Understanding climate information is a foundation step in making well-informed decisions in the face of climate change.\n","5261:  However, climate information is only one of many aspects that must be considered in a decision-making process.\n","5264:  Decision-makers routinely deal with many different sources of uncertainty concerning the future, aside from the fact that the climate or the weather is also changing.\n","5265:  Variables such as demographic changes, economic growth and many others, impact the way decisions are made, but do not prevent long-term decisions such as investing in major infrastructure or protecting areas from development.\n","5266:  Lessons learned from decision-making in the face of these other uncertainties can help inform the decision-making process under a changing climate.\n","5267:  Climate information should never be the sole basis upon which decisions are made but instead must be used in combination with other decision-support tools such as cost-benefit, multi-criteria analyses or hazard mapping tools.\n","5268:  Including a range of factors will help ensure that decisions are robust and more readily implemented.\n","5269:  Such analysis will help recognize adaptation measures that may be theoretically attractive but that could generate undesired impacts, may not be economically viable or do not have enough public support to be put in place.\n","5270:  There is no such thing as the best climate scenario.\n","5271:  The range of results obtained from a large number of climate simulations must be used to guide decisions.\n","5272:  This spread in climate model results informs the decision-maker on the probable outcomes from worse to best given the current state of knowledge.\n","5273:  One way that the range in climate model results feeds into an effective decision-making framework is through the use of a sensitivity analysis that allows decision-makers to assess the consequences of each alternative future.\n","5274:  The goal is to evaluate the impacts associated with the range of different climate scenarios and assess how adaptation measures perform in the face of this range of plausible futures.\n","5275:  Different approaches can be used to conduct a sensitivity analysis, such as: _ estimating the consequences of each alternative future; _ identifying climate scenarios under which a given policy or adaptation measure would fail and what the consequences might be; _ using the full range of available scenarios to determine which adaptation measures will perform well regardless of the magnitude or intensity of the expected climate change _ these are often referred to as no-regret measures.\n","5276:  Scenario planning represents another way to consider the uncertainties.\n","5277:  In this approach, initial common steps are identified for a number of different possible solutions that do not confine the results to only one end point, but rather leave many options open.\n","5278:  Critical milestones can be used to reassess the adaptation measures in light of the best available science, and adjustments to plans made as required.\n","5279:  Decision-making in a changing world implies that an iterative risk management approach should be prioritized.\n","5280:  Decisions must be re-evaluated and adjusted as new knowledge about both climatic and non- climatic variables becomes available.\n","5281:  Monitoring and learning should be an important part of the process.\n","5282:  75 | GUIDEBOOK ON CLIMATE SCENARIOS CHAPTER FIVE CASE

summaries were produced with the support of the BC Ministry of Forestry, Lands and Natural Resource Operations, as part of PCIC_s ongoing mission to help regional stakeholders in British Columbia plan for projected changes to climate.\n","5287:  Each summary begins with a brief, general overview of climate change in BC and a short discussion of the topography, climate influences, ecosystems and economies of the region.\n","5289:  Projected changes of a number of climatic variables, such as temperature, precipitation, snowfall, growing degree-days, heating In addition to highlighting historical trends and the future projections, the summaries also outline key impacts that may be felt by various sectors, infrastructure and ecosystems.\n","5290:  The information presented in the summaries has been used by the Government of British Columbia to present a portrait of the climate to decision-makers and planners of the province.\n","5291:  By giving a general overview of the evolution of the climate over the past 100 years and of the projected changes over the next 50 years, the information can be used to start a dialogue about the impacts that have already been felt by different actors of the sector and to begin a reflection on possible future impacts.\n","5292:  Website: publications http://www.pacificclimate.org/resources/ Project Title: Rosemont _ La Petite-Patrie_s zoning bylaw to reduce the urban heat island effect.\n","5293:  Region: Montreal_s borough of Rosemont _ La Petite- Patrie Summary and Application: This borough is densely built and subject to significant heat island effects.\n","5294:  This phenomenon occurs in cities where ambient air temperatures tend to be hotter than in surrounding areas due to the high percentage of dark surfaces (such as tar roofs and asphalt roads), the amount of heat- retaining (namely concrete) buildings that cool more slowly than the surrounding air, and limited vegetated areas.\n","5295:  In order to combat this problem, the borough council revised its zoning bylaw in April 2011 to include the following four regulatory measures: (1) when replacing an existing roof or constructing a new building, the owner must install either a green roof or a highly reflective roof; (2) for all new parking lots of 10 or more spaces, at least 15 percent of the area must be open ground landscaped with plants, bushes and trees; (3) all new paving materials must meet a minimum specified surface reflectivity rating; and (4) when constructing a new building, at least 20 percent of the building site must remain open ground and be landscaped with plants, bushes and trees.\n","5296:  is not always required This example highlights the fact that complex climate information in order to implement

potential risks of certain crop pests through an evaluation of analogue regions56.\n","5300:  More specifically, the aim was to identify spatial analogues further south in the United States that corresponded to different administrative regions in Quebec in order to examine which pests were already present in the analogue regions and what adaptation measures had been taken to combat associated problems.\n","5301:  The analogues were based on growing season length, growing degree-days, and precipitation during the growing season.\n","5302:  Two main enemies of crops were investigated.\n","5303:  The first was the Fusarium head blight (F. graminearum), a disease of wheat, which renders the grain unsuitable for human and animal consumption.\n","5304:  This disease has been on the rise in southern Canada and has caused important economic losses in many regions57.\n","5305:  For this disease, it was found that Pennsylvania was a good climate analogue for the Bas-Saint-Laurent region in 2050.\n","5306:  Based on this information, researchers have begun to explore adaptation measures adopted by the state of Pennsylvania, such as relying on different strains that mature at different times throughout the summer, to combat this potential problem in the Bas- Saint-Laurent.\n","5307:  The second problem was the corn borer (O. nubilalis), an insect that causes important damage to crops of sweet corn, which is destined for human consumption.\n","5308:  Regarding this insect, it was found that the climate in the Mont_r_gie may become more similar to the recent climate of Illinois.\n","5309:  In this state, the insect has a more rapid growth rate than in Quebec and represents one of the most important sweet corn diseases56.\n","5310:  The results of

the strong natural climate variability observed in that region, due in part to the effects of El Ni_o, the Southern Oscillation, and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation.\n","5318:  The magnitude of projected changes could then be compared with this variability.\n","5319:  The results informed the City of Prince George that important changes in temperature and precipitation were projected, which were likely to have important impacts on many factors, such as flood risks, forest fires, water supply, and transportation infrastructure, to name a few.\n","5320:  This climate information was presented at two workshops in Prince George, which allowed the city officials a valuable opportunity to visualize the information, to digest it and importantly, to address questions directly to the climate scientist who had produced the information59 Based on this information, they could then discuss specific impacts and explore adaptation options for the city.\n","5321:  The outcome of these exercises was the development of an adaptation strategy for the City of Prince George, where top adaptation priorities were identified along with potential actions to address them.\n","5322:

scale many range from local (such as a city), through regional (such as a province) to continental or global.\n","5437:  Temporal scales may range from monthly, to seasonal to geological for example.\n","5438:  SRES scenarios: The term stands for Special Report on Emissions Scenarios.\n","5440:  Synthetic scenario: A way of constructing future climates without relying on climate models.\n","5441:  The scenarios are built by adjusting meteorological parameters in a time series by incremental amounts, which are loosely based on either GCM outputs, past climate reconstructions, or expert opinion.\n","5442:  Uncertainty: An expression of the degree to which a value (e.g.\n","5443:  the future state of the climate system) is unknown.\n","5444:  Uncertainty can result from lack of information or from disagreement about what is known or even knowable.\n","5445:  It can have many types of sources, from quantifiable errors in data to ambiguously defined concepts or terminology, or uncertain projections of human behaviour.\n","5446:  Variable: The term climate variable is used to refer to a variable that can be measured directly in the field (at meteorological stations for example) or that is calculated by climate models.\n","5447:  (See Index) Variability: See Climate variability Vintage: The term vintage is used in the guide to refer to global climate model ensembles that are issued from one particular Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, such as CMIP3 and CMIP5.\n","5448:  Vulnerability: The degree to which is system is susceptible to, and unable to cope with, adverse effects of climate change.\n","5449:  It is a function of the character, magnitude and rate of change to which a system is exposed and the sensitivity and adaptive capacity of that system.\n","5450:  87 | GUIDEBOOK ON CLIMATE SCENARIOS References for this glossary: IPCC, 2013: Annex III: Glossary [Planton, S.\n","5451:  (ed.)].\n","5452:  In: Climate Change 2013: The Physical

considerable science-based evidence that the global climate is changing, with increasing overall temperatures, increasing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, and altered patterns of precipitation.\n","5697:  The Lancet Commission (2015) speaks to the many and serious impacts of climate change on health, and how addressing these could be _the greatest global health opportunity of the 21st century_.\n","5698:  Extreme weather events and increased climate variability associated with climate change exacerbate current public health challenges globally, and present new risks to populations.\n","5699:  For Canada, various effects of climate change play a significant compounding factor that negatively affects the health and resilience of vulnerable communities.\n","5701:  addressing food security, availability of potable water, safe housing, working conditions, stable income, and sustainable development).\n","5702:  This would support a more integrated or horizontal approach whereby adaptation frameworks are informed by different perspectives.\n","5704:  It is important for all sectors to bring their unique positions and perspectives together to define future considerations in governance and actions towards successful adaptations for mitigating health impacts of climate change in Canada and globally.\n","5705:  SCIENCE NARRATIVE I CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS ON THE HEALTH OF CANADIANS 3 1.0 HEALTH IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE Risks to the health of Canadians from climate change include direct and indirect illnesses1 and deaths related to poor air quality, water- and food-borne contamination, changing patterns of diseases spread by animals, ticks and insects, and extreme weather events including extreme heat events and urban heat islands.\n","5706:  Human-generated greenhouse gas emissions2 (GHGs) contribute to climate change and these gas emissions derive in part from aspects of the built environment3 such as transportation systems and infrastructure, building construction and operation, and land-use planning (1,2).\n","5707:  Special challenges and impacts on northern Canadians are already being observed such as more dangerous travel (unusual changes in ice, snow and land conditions), damaged infrastructure due to permafrost melt, threats to traditional food sources, disappearance of drinking water sources and related-psychosocial and cultural impacts.\n","5708:  Those most vulnerable are facing several compounding risks such as chronic health conditions, multiple environmental hazard exposures, the extremes of age, socio-economic deprivation, physical and/or social isolation.\n","5709:  Sustainable healthcare in a changing climate presents further risks to Canadians as its capacity is strained in many ways such as from the aging population, resource intensive infrastructure, professional needs and budget constraints (1).\n","5710:  Key areas of health risks linked to climate change are now examined.\n","5711:  1 Such as: asthma, respiratory allergies, and airway diseases, cancer, heat-related morbidity and mortality, human developmental effects, cardiovascular disease and stroke, mental health and stress-related disorders, foodborne diseases and nutrition, neurological diseases and disorders, vector-borne and zoonotic diseases, waterborne diseases, weather-related morbidity and mortality.\n","5712:  2 These are gases that trap heat in the atmosphere.\n","5713:  3 The built environment means the buildings, transportation systems, energy systems, open space, and agricultural lands that make up and support our communities (Toronto Public Health; www1.toronto.ca/wps/portal/ contentonly?vgnextoid=d06e23bf6d481410VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD) SCIENCE NARRATIVE I CLIMATE CHANGE

vectors.\n","5718:  Major shifts in the epidemiology of several vector-borne diseases and appearances on new continents have been predicted as a result of climate change (3,4).\n","5719:  Climate change is likely to have both direct and indirect impacts on the burden of West Nile fever, dengue, Chickungunya fever, malaria, leishmaniasis, tick-borne encephalitis, Lyme borreliosis, Crimean- Congo haemorrhagic fever, spotted fever rickettsioses, Yellow fever, Zika and Rift Valley fever (5,6).\n","5720:  Population mobility is a main factor in globalization of public health threats and risks due to infectious diseases.\n","5721:  Traditional health policy approaches have focused on diseases of global public health significance such as tuberculosis, Yellow fever, and cholera; however, new diseases and resistant organisms challenge existing approaches.\n","5722:  Clinical implications and health policy challenges associated with movement of persons across barriers permeable to products, pathogens, and toxins (e.g.\n","5724:  Outcomes are complicated by high numbers of persons who move across disparate and diverse settings of disease threat and risk.\n","5725:  Existing policies and processes merit an approach to global public health risk management that integrates population factors with effective and timely application of policies and processes (7,8).\n","5726:  The incidence, outbreak frequency, and distribution of many infectious diseases are generally expected to change as a consequence of different factors related to climate change.\n","5727:  Temperature and precipitation patterns influence food- and water-borne diseases.\n","5728:  Changes in seasonal precipitation and temperature influence vector-borne diseases through i. effects on vector survival, reproduction rates, habitat suitability, distribution, and abundance; ii.\n","5729:  the intensity and temporal pattern of vector activity (biting rates); and iii.\n","5730:  rates of pathogen development, survival, and reproduction within vectors.\n","5731:  The projected climate changes may shift the distributional ranges of vector-borne diseases (5,6).\n","5732:  As an example, the number of tick-borne diseases of humans has increased in incidence and geographic range over the past few decades, and there is concern that they will pose an even greater threat to public health in the future.\n","5733:  Global warming is often cited as the underlying mechanism favouring the spread of tick-borne diseases, as climate will influence which tick species are found in a given geographic region, their population density, the likelihood that they will be infected with microbes pathogenic for humans, and the frequency of tick-human contact.\n","5734:  Changes in climate will influence spread and survival of other insect vectors including mosquitoes, fleas, sandflies, tsetse flies, and houseflies, known to carry highly pathogenic microorganisms infecting man.\n","5736:  Another concern with increasing temperatures is that ancient bacteria and viruses could re-emerge and revive as global warming melts ice at the poles exposing long dormant organisms.\n","5737:  An example is the August 2016 Anthrax outbreak in the Russian Federation which was triggered by ice melt in temperatures of 35_C in the Arctic Circle4.\n","5738:  This brought anthrax spores to the

SCIENCE NARRATIVE I CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS ON THE HEALTH OF CANADIANS 5 1.2 FOOD SAFETY AND SECURITY There are other diseases that are likely to be exacerbated in a warmer world including food-borne and respiratory diseases.\n","5744:  It has been shown that reported cases of salmonellosis and campylobacteriosis peak in the hot summer months and that this association was observed at temperatures greater than 37.5_C (9).\n","5745:  In Canada, some experts may consider the effect of climate change on food-borne diseases to be minimal providing appropriate food handling and storage procedures and improved food hygiene (10).\n","5746:  Indigenous Peoples are among the most vulnerable to climate change and experience distinctive challenges (11), particularly those living in remote locations.\n","5747:  A range of factors that apply to each vulnerability assessment are layered with issues that are unique to Indigenous communities and culture to varying degrees.\n","5748:  These may include reliance on the rapidly changing natural environment for cultural, social, mental and physical health and well-being, and livelihoods.\n","5749:  Historical legacies have influenced development of Indigenous communities in Canada.\n","5750:  Many have a number of socio-economic challenges, including disproportionate fiscal and population pressures; sub-standard infrastructure; and limited access to health services (12).\n","5751:  Many of these factors are exacerbated by the more dramatic impacts of climate change in extreme environments.\n","5752:  Food security and access to potable water are fundamental to health.\n","5753:  Store-bought food and water are extremely expensive in remote areas.\n","5754:  This combined with decreased access to traditional food sources and increasingly expensive and undependable conditions for safe and affordable transportation in remote regions are deepening existing food and water security concerns (13).\n","5755:  Household food insecurity has been associated with a range of poor physical and mental health outcomes, including multiple chronic conditions and depression (14,15).\n","5756:  SCIENCE NARRATIVE I CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS ON THE HEALTH OF CANADIANS 6 1.3 WATERBORNE DISEASE Waterborne diseases are also likely to be influenced by climate change.\n","5757:  The importance of climate as a driver of disease risk is derived from observations that waterborne disease outbreaks are often preceded by heavy rainfall.\n","5758:  This link is likely to be most obvious for inadequately treated water or small rural supplies.\n","5759:  Several authors have pointed out links between cholera and climate variables especially with higher temperature and rainfall, flooding and major climatic cycles such as El Ni_o.\n","5760:  Cyanobacteria are present in drinking and recreational waters and most reported human cases were associated with observable cyanobacterial blooms with known neurotoxicity.\n","5761:  The impact of droughts on health through reduced agricultural productivity and access to water in affluent countries is not clear, but effects in resource poor countries are likely to be dramatic (16).\n","5763:  The frequency and intensity of extreme weather events is predicted to rise as a result of climate variability.\n","5764:  Beyond physical damage, effects of disasters such as floods, extreme droughts, storms and hurricanes on human health seem to be mostly indirect (mediated through vector and waterborne diseases).\n","5767:  This is of particular relevance internationally through the sustainable development goals and nationally through the revised Federal Sustainable Development Strategy5.\n","5768:  Evidence indicates that exposure of persons and assets in all countries has

environmental impact in the short, medium and long term, especially at the local and community levels.\n","5770:  Recurring small-scale disasters and slow-onset disasters particularly affect communities, households and small and medium-sized enterprises, constituting a high percentage of all losses.\n","5771:  All countries are faced with increasing levels of possible hidden or unanticipated costs and challenges in order to meet financial and other obligations (19).\n","5772:  1.5 EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT, HEALTH SECURITY AND GLOBAL STABILITY Between 2008 and 2012 there were 144 million people displaced by disasters (20) with people in vulnerable situations affected disproportionately.\n","5773:  This represents a population larger than the combined populations of Britain and France.\n","5774:  For some disasters the effect of the displacement can be indirect such as with environmental refugees, or that new conflicts arise due to scarcity of basic resources (20).\n","5775:  The problems of heat stress and heat stress-related mortality are considered an area of major direct impact because of the severity of the outcome (death) and increased pressure on governments to respond.\n","5776:  An example is the intense 2003 European heat wave, which caused the death of more than 35,000 mainly elderly persons (21).\n","5777:  Event coincidence analysis was used to investigate data from armed-conflict outbreaks and climate-related natural disasters for the period 1980_2010 (22).\n","5778:  A coincidence rate of 9% regarding armed-conflict outbreak and disaster occurrence such as heat waves or droughts was observed.\n","5779:  During this period, about 23% of conflict outbreaks in ethnically highly fractionalized countries robustly coincided with climatic calamities.\n","5780:  Although climate-related disasters do not act as direct triggers of armed conflicts, the disruptive nature of these events seems to play out in ethnically fractionalized societies in a particularly tragic way.\n","5781:  This observation has important implications for future security policies as several of the world_s most conflict-prone regions, including North and Central Africa as well as Central Asia.\n","5782:  Both of these areas are exceptionally vulnerable to anthropogenic climate change and characterized by deep ethnic divides (22).\n","5784:  Globally, MCMs play a critical role in addressing all manner of health security threats.\n","5785:  This is highly relevant with regards to climate change impacts on the evolving public health threat and risk landscape.\n","5786:  Increased movement of people and goods leads to increased risk of disease transmission; emerging and re-emerging infectious disease outbreaks, including antimicrobial- resistant pathogens; and increased risk of terrorism threat agents due to evolving geo-political landscapes.\n","5787:  Ongoing awareness and foresight in ensuring that effective and relevant MCMs are developed and acquired for use to protect Canadians is a key area of responsibility for the federal government.\n","5788:  The uncertainty and potentially extreme impacts of these types of events on health security in Canada and globally are important considerations in emergency preparedness and response systems_ evolution, innovation and responsiveness.\n","5789:  SCIENCE NARRATIVE I CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS ON THE HEALTH OF CANADIANS 8 1.6 CHRONIC DISEASE There is an emerging literature about the pathways by which climate change can have an impact on health and non-communicable diseases (18).\n","5790:  For example air pollution, increased heat exposure and changes to agricultural systems (land use) have been linked to the built environment (23) with aspects such as walkability, travel, and vehicle emissions.\n","5791:  Furthermore, scientific evidence has linked air pollution to cardiovascular diseases (24), asthma and lung cancer (25), neurological diseases (26), diabetes (26) and symptoms of depression (27).\n","5792:  Air pollution is also associated with decreased physical activity among adults of normal weight (28).\n","5793:  Extreme heat events have been linked to increases in hospital admissions for respiratory, kidney and heart-related conditions (28); the effects can be made worse due to the urban heat island effect and the types of built structures and the materials used (23).\n","5794:  Urbanization, with its high levels of vehicle emissions, extreme temperatures and westernized lifestyle, is linked to the rising frequency of respiratory allergic diseases and cardiovascular disease observed over recent decades in most industrialized countries.\n","5796:  The main driver of respiratory disease is air pollution itself rather than climate change and the main intervention for respiratory diseases is emission reduction.\n","5797:  There is a risk of increased exposure to toxic chemicals, known or suspected to cause cancer, that are released into the environment following thawing permafrost, heavy rainfall or flooding and by increased volatilization of chemicals under conditions of increased temperature (25).\n","5800:  This presents a classic example of possible health adaptations to climate change that both reduce vulnerability and enhance community resilience.\n","5801:  SCIENCE NARRATIVE I CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS ON THE HEALTH OF CANADIANS 9 1.7 MENTAL HEALTH Climate change affects mental health due to changes in the prevalence and severity of natural disasters on human settlements.\n","5802:  These events can cause anxiety-related responses and later potentially lead to chronic and severe mental health disorders, with implications for mental health systems and supports (27).\n","5803:  These effects will fall disproportionately on individuals who are already vulnerable, especially for Indigenous people and those living in low-resource settings (30).\n","5804:  Additionally, individuals might feel a distressing sense of loss that people experience when their land is damaged and they lose amenities and opportunity (31).\n","5805:  The mental health effects of these losses are becoming evident in many Indigenous communities where connectivity to the land is integral to psychological, physical and cultural wellbeing.\n","5806:  Changing climatic conditions are causing a variety of changes to the land, sea and snow environments, which are impacting the security of spirituality, food, travel and culture (14).\n","5808:  Even in high-income regions where the humanitarian crisis might be less, the impact on the local economy, damaged homes, and economic losses can persist for years after natural disasters (34).\n","5809:  Government and agencies now emphasise psychological and psychosocial interventions within disaster response and emergency management.\n","5810:  Social adaptation processes can mediate public risk perceptions and understanding, psychological and social impacts, coping responses, and behavioural adaptation (35).\n","5811:  SCIENCE NARRATIVE I CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS ON THE HEALTH OF CANADIANS 10 1.8 PHYSICAL ACTIVITY As the climate changes, various impacts on the ability to be physically active, as well as impacts on those who are being physically active, are in evidence.\n","5812:  Conditions that are known to be associated with physical activity, such as obesity, pulmonary and cardiac health, and mental health are thus being influenced both directly and indirectly by climate change.\n","5813:  Outdoor activities can be limited by increased heat and air pollution (36).\n","5814:  Longer-term shifts in environmental conditions, such as shorter seasons with snow and ice, can both provide opportunities for some outdoor activities (hiking, walking, cycling) or decrease others and their hazards (skiing, snowmobiling; sunburns, avalanche risk).\n","5815:  A significant source of climate change comes from private motor vehicles emissions and home energy expenditure (e.g.\n","5816:  home heating and cooling).\n","5817:  Urban planning, which supports more compact living and sustainable transportation such as transit and active transportation, would reduce greenhouse gas emissions and encourage greater physical activity and its associated health benefits (37).\n","5818:  As a result, benefits from policies and programs aimed at mitigating climate change at the individual level, and particularly in the transportation sector, also have the benefit of increasing active transportation and as a result physical activity levels (38).\n","5819:  SCIENCE NARRATIVE I CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS ON THE HEALTH OF CANADIANS 11 2.0 ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE RISKS TO HEALTH6 _Much of the potential health impact of climate change can however be avoided through a combination of strengthening key health system functions and improved management of the risks presented by a changing climate._ 7 As the climate continues to change and impacts on health are increasingly evident, adaptation is needed to reduce growing risks to vulnerable populations and communities.\n","5820:  Successful adaptation requires intersectoral collaboration (e.g.\n","5821:  health, environment, planning, transport, infrastructure) on monitoring and surveillance of climate change health outcomes, addressing root causes that limit preparedness (e.g.\n","5822:  poverty), identification of vulnerable populations, reducing uncertainty through increased research on impacts, educating the public and decision makers about potential disasters and the benefits of preparedness, and the financing of needed measures.\n","5824:  increase social capital, improve urban design) that address related health concerns, and when they are mainstreamed into existing programs and planning.\n","5825:  For instance, federal departments are mandated by the Cabinet Directive on the Environmental Assessment of Policy, Plan, and Program Proposals (Cabinet Directive) to complete Strategic Environmental Assessments (SEAs) for all policy, plan, and program proposals (39).\n","5826:  Completing a SEA (40) ensures that decision makers at all levels have taken economic, social, and environmental considerations into account to make informed decisions in support of sustainable development.\n","5827:  2.1 ADAPTATION MEASURES AND STRATEGIES TO PROTECT HEALTH There is now a large body of scientific work to frame the concept of adaption in a changing climate.\n","5828:  Decision makers across health issue files and different levels of government have exchanged knowledge and promising practices in health promotion, public health intervention, and emergency management.\n","5829:  Despite this, Canada does not have a comprehensive and systematic framework to address the interface between climate change and health.\n","5830:  In moving towards this, it is important to have a shared understanding of key concepts that underpin this process.\n","5831:  Adaptation to climate change is commonly defined as _the process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects, in human systems in order to moderate harm or exploit beneficial opportunities, and in natural systems human intervention may facilitate adjustment to expected climate_ (41).\n","5832:  6 Section 2.0 is adapted from _Canada in a

from climate change (47).\n","5858:  Specifically, it is one of the leading countries with respect to the depth of research being led on vulnerability, to the impacts of climate change and adaptation options within the health sector.\n","5859:  It is also one of the few countries to recognize and develop specific adaptation options around vulnerabilities of Indigenous Peoples.\n","5860:  Health adaptation efforts ongoing at federal, provincial, territorial and local levels related to assessing vulnerabilities, preparing for the impacts and communicating health risks to Canadians were examined.\n","5861:  Neither a comprehensive inventory of all local and regional adaptations (e.g.\n","5862:  infectious disease surveillance, emergency management programs), nor a comprehensive assessment of the state of health adaptation in Canada are available at this time.\n","5863:  However, communities can draw from information from various sources in order to set priorities, select appropriate strategies and implement them in a sustainable manner as a complement to existing programs, to protect and enhance health in their respective jurisdictions.\n","5864:  2.2.1 ASSESSING IMPACTS AND VULNERABILITIES Climate change and health vulnerability assessments help identify populations in a community or region who are vulnerable to the impacts, gauge the effectiveness of existing interventions and programs, identify additional measures necessary to respond to climate change, strengthen capacity to take action, and provide a baseline of information to monitor adaptation progress.\n","5865:  The World Health Organization (WHO) recently released new guidelines for assessing health vulnerabilities to climate change and adaptation options and Health Canada released guidelines for assessing the vulnerability of communities and individuals to extreme heat.\n","5868:  Cheng and Berry (2013) have identified a key basket of climate change and health indicators that can be used by health authorities to track impacts on health over time (25).\n","5869:  At present, few health authorities at regional and local levels have conducted full climate

Health (Ontario) used the new WHO guidelines to conduct a health vulnerability assessment that will contribute to implementation of the Region of Peel Climate Change Strategy (50).\n","5873:  In addition, some public health authorities and their partners are currently undertaking or have undertaken research projects that contribute to knowledge of local vulnerability to specific health impacts.\n","5874:  Expertise on climate change and health issues is growing and many universities and organizations across Canada are undertaking research in this area.\n","5875:  SCIENCE NARRATIVE I CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS ON THE HEALTH OF CANADIANS 16 2.2.2 PREPARING FOR THE IMPACTS Protecting health from climate change impacts requires _mainstreaming_ climate change considerations into existing risk assessment and management activities.\n","5876:  Mainstreaming is based on _flexible_ adaptation and institutional learning, which is responsive to changing risks to health, climate surprises, and individual- and community-level vulnerabilities.\n","5877:  Mainstreaming aims to reduce duplication and contradictions between existing public health interventions and new adaptations developed in response to climate change.\n","5878:  Evidence of mainstreaming in provincial and territorial policies, regulatory instruments and planning tools includes Strategic Direction 1 in the _Quebec In Action _ Greener by 2020: Government Strategy for Climate Change Adaptation_ (51) that integrates climate change adaptation into government administration by modifying, where needed, the content of laws, regulations, strategies, policies, and planning tools.\n","5879:  In Nunavut, the climate change adaptation plan requires all departments and agencies to _[...] integrate climate change projections, impacts, and best practices in all levels of their decision-making in order to implement a comprehensive response to climate change_ (52).\n","5880:  One study in Ontario found evidence of adaptation through the mainstreaming of climate change into existing public health programs (50).\n","5881:  Outside of government, the Insurance Bureau of Canada is developing a municipal risk assessment tool (53) that can help community decision makers use climate change information to address infrastructure vulnerabilities to projected flood events.\n","5882:  Other initiatives also contribute to reducing health risks from climate change.\n","5884:  For example, the provinces of Manitoba, Quebec, and Nova Scotia have provincial HARS (50) in place while Alberta is initiating one, and health authorities in Ontario are collaborating to maximize the effectiveness and integration of local systems.\n","5885:  In addition, some activities that were not developed with the primary purpose of protecting health can indirectly help to improve health and wellbeing and thereby reduce the impacts of climate change (e.g.\n","5886:  Drought Response Plan by the British Columbia Inter-Agency Drought Working Group) (54).\n","5887:  New approaches and tools have been developed that could facilitate efforts to assist vulnerable groups in Canada and improve understanding of adaptation options at the individual and community levels.\n","5888:  2.2.3 COMMUNICATING HEALTH RISKS TO THE PUBLIC There are few formal evaluations of public education efforts to reduce health risks associated with climate change.\n","5889:  Those that have been completed show mixed results.\n","5890:  A study of the education campaign in Montreal, Quebec indicated that people who have been exposed to education materials were more likely to take protective measures against heat through, for example, the use of lightweight clothing, avoiding strenuous exercise, taking a shower or bath to cool down, and hydration.\n","5891:  However, other studies suggest that while knowledge of heat warnings is very broad (>90%), protective actions taken by individuals are inadequate or that perceptions of health risks are generally low and the adoption of preventative actions is not widespread.\n","5892:  SCIENCE NARRATIVE I CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS ON THE HEALTH OF CANADIANS 17 Research on levels of public awareness and the effectiveness of health promotion campaigns related to air quality advisories, food safety and reducing risks from vector-borne diseases show similarly mixed results.\n","5893:  Public awareness messaging on climate-related risks can be contradictory (e.g.\n","5894:  exercising later in the day to avoid extreme heat versus not going outdoors at night to avoid contracting West Nile Virus).\n","5895:  To maximize effectiveness, health promotion programs should develop consistent messaging across health issue areas.\n","5896:  2.2.4 HEALTH RELATED RESEARCH NEEDS Over the last 15 years, calls for expanded research efforts on climate-related health risks have resulted in a growing body of research to help guide actions to protect the health of

and outdoor workers) to identify health impacts from slow developing hazards (e.g.\n","5907:  drought) and cumulative effects of climate change (e.g.\n","5908:  extreme heat, drought and wild fires).\n","5909:  SCIENCE NARRATIVE I CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS ON THE HEALTH OF CANADIANS 19 3.0 SOCIETY, CULTURE AND BEHAVIOUR Global climate change impacts on human and natural systems are predicted to be severe and far reaching.\n","5910:  The most physically and economically vulnerable will be affected disproportionately.\n","5912:  Importantly, these approaches must take diversity in society, and cultural norms, practices and preferences into account to ensure uptake and success.\n","5913:  Industry, commerce, and government play indispensable roles in these actions but outcomes are ultimately dependent on individuals and receptivity to behavioural changes.\n","5914:  Thus, the climate change discourse could be framed from a health perspective to motivate behaviour change (55).\n","5915:  There is however, little evidence on how to change behaviours that contribute to climate change (56).\n","5916:  In considering the broader scientific discourse on the determinants of behaviour and behavioural change, four themes stand out9.\n","5917:  First, knowledge deficits are not the primary barrier to action; knowing about the causes and consequences of climate change does not, on its own, motivate people to change their lifestyles (57).\n","5918:  Instead, it is emotions_the feelings that accompany thinking_that are central (58).\n","5919:  Negative emotions, including fear, pessimism, and guilt, can produce passive and defensive responses, and do little to encourage individuals to change their behaviour and to press for wider social action.\n","5920:  So-called _fear appeals_ only work if accompanied by equally strong messages about how to address the problem (59).\n","5921:  Second, climate change is best represented in ways that anchor it in positive emotions (60), by framing action in ways that connect with people_s core values and identities.\n","5922:  Examples include framing climate change as: an ethical and intergenerational issue; about safeguarding ancestral lands and the sanctity of the natural world; or an appreciation of the global injustice of anthropogenic climate change driven by rich countries but paid for by poorer ones (61).\n","5923:  Aligning climate change to a range of ethical positions and a core set of identities can offer a way of appealing to diverse social groups, and thus securing a broad and inclusive platform of public support for action.\n","5924:  Avoiding the rhetoric of climate catastrophe could facilitate this, and emphasise, instead, human capacity to steer a course to a sustainable future, including lifting the burdens that unmitigated climate change would otherwise impose on future generations (62).\n","5925:  Third, integral to such an ethical framing of climate change is the implied duty on national and international organisations to take action.\n","5926:  A recurrent finding is that the public sees the main responsibility for action lying with governments and other powerful institutions, not least because the options open to individuals to take radical action to cut their own GHG emissions are often sorely limited by cost or availability (e.g.\n","5927:  poor public transport provision).\n","5928:  Public willingness to take action is also contingent on those considered responsible for climate change, taking action themselves (63).\n","5930:  9 Excerpt from Lancet Commission on Health and Climate Change: Policy responses to protect public health (2015).\n","5931:  SCIENCE NARRATIVE I CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS ON THE HEALTH OF CANADIANS 20 Fourth, many climate-affecting behaviours are habitual and resistant to change.\n","5932:  Everyday domestic energy use (e.g.\n","5933:  cooking, heating the home), travel behaviour, and eating patterns are undertaken as part of a daily routine and without conscious thought.\n","5935:  While adaptation is largely dependent on the availability of information relevant to climate change, it appears that motivation for voluntary mitigation is mostly dependent on perceived susceptibility to threats and severity of climate change or climate variability impacts.\n","5938:  Opposing national (and vested) interests, clashing views of what constitutes fair distribution of effort, and a model of economic growth that is currently tied to fossil fuel use, can make progress fraught.\n","5939:  Hulme (2011) outlines several key climate change issues that when framed as a health issue, rather than purely as an environmental, economic, or technological challenge, makes the need for action that much clearer (65).\n","5940:  Health puts a more personal and human face on what can sometimes seem to be a distant threat.\n","5941:  By making the case for climate change as a health issue, it is hoped that the civilizational crisis we face will achieve greater public resonance.\n","5943:  The scientific literature relates a few avenues for public health engagement in the context of mitigation: the continued work towards establishing a framework for a strong, predictable, and international carbon pricing mechanisms; rapidly expanding access to renewable energy in low-income and middle-income countries; ensuring adequate local capacity and political support to develop low-carbon healthy energy choices; adopting mechanisms to facilitate collaboration between Ministries of Health and other government departments and empowering health professionals; agreeing and implementing an international agreement which supports countries in transitioning to a low-carbon economy; and investing in climate change and public health research.\n","5944:  SCIENCE NARRATIVE I CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS ON THE HEALTH OF CANADIANS 21 4.0 CLIMATE CHANGE, HEALTH AND AN INTEGRATED APPROACH An integrated approach to addressing climate change and health related issues will require innovative horizontal program development.\n","5945:  Understanding and meeting the different needs and objectives of participating government departments, provincial partners and various stakeholders will be critical to effective and ongoing engagement.\n","5946:  Grounding this approach in a climate change framework will require strategic engagement across files that are normally structured in a _silo_ or thematic way in order to enhance common understanding of the horizontal nature of the health impacts of climate change.\n","5947:  Programs can be designed by aligning work across key activities, with strong integration of the science and policy.\n","5948:  This will ensure best use of limited resources to address the complex and layered issues presented by the health effects of climate change.\n","5949:  Weaknesses in systems and infrastructures in various sectors are necessarily interconnected, with a variety of anticipated and unanticipated knock on effects.\n","5950:  Climate change is exacerbating already vulnerable situations, which puts demands not only on the impacted region itself, but also on external efforts to establish sustainable ways to reduce human health impacts.\n","5951:  Stark evidence of this can be seen in resource poor regions.\n","5952:  The recent Ebola health crisis in West Africa was an extreme example of a tipping point of multiple systems that already had little to no resilience.\n","5953:  In Sierra Leone (the epicenter of the Ebola outbreak) climate change had already weakened that country_s vulnerable infrastructures and capacity (health, physical, agriculture, etc) with unusually intense _seasonal droughts, strong winds, thunderstorms, landslides, heat waves, floods, and changed rainfall patterns_ (66).\n","5954:  This made all aspects of emergency response to the emerging disease situation that much more difficult.\n","5955:  Ultimately, the cost, both in human lives and financially, was very high.\n","5956:  Globalization in all markets rapidly moves goods, people and infectious diseases to new areas of the world.\n","5957:  This is further complicated by the fact that novel pathogens are emerging more rapidly, often from areas with high populations, poor sanitation and nutrition, and greater mobility than ever before.\n","5958:  Overarching understanding and awareness of existing and future risk and trends in various sectors, and how they interact and support each other, will be critical to adaptive capacity globally.\n","5960:  _ Surveillance and Monitoring: Using research data and analysis gathered from public health surveillance systems to address health impacts related to climate change including identifying disease trends and identifying vulnerable individuals and communities.\n","5961:  _ Building and Sustaining Healthy Environments: Playing a role in making infrastructure more resilient by informing and educating the public about health risks, advocating for changes that promote and improve health, and encouraging the adoption of health-promoting change in urban planning and community infrastructure.\n","5962:  _ Capacity Building: Building community resilience by increasing the capacity of individuals and communities to cope and adapt to current and anticipated changes in climate.\n","5963:  SCIENCE NARRATIVE I CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS ON THE HEALTH OF CANADIANS 22 _ Research and Innovation: Research to increase knowledge and address gaps on potential climate-related health risks and health resilience including how and which populations and communities are most vulnerable.\n","5964:  _ Emergency Planning: Advancing overall public health preparedness for climate impacts to enhance public health security related to health, critical public health services and infrastructure (e.g.\n","5965:  enhanced monitoring and surveillance and risk management measures).\n","5966:  _ Leadership: Strengthening partnerships across Canada by engaging Provincial and _ Territorial governments and key stakeholders to strengthen the national capacity to deal with current and future impacts of climate change on public health Integrating Adaptation and Sustainable Development into Federal Policy and Planning: Ensuring that climate change considerations are integrated into and across federal activities, such as research, policy, and planning processes.\n","5967:  These actions also serve to strengthen accountability and transparency, providing greater public confidence that decisions in the federal government are being made in full awareness of potential social, health, economic and environmental impacts.\n","5968:  SCIENCE NARRATIVE I CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS ON THE HEALTH OF CANADIANS 23 5.0 FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS Identified as _the greatest health threat of the 21st century_ (8), the global impact of climate change is a key cross cutting issue of our time that has the potential to cause instability on an unprecedented scale.\n","5969:  Adaptation measures are already required as the effects of climate change are being experienced today.\n","5970:  From a health-based perspective, a number of key elements should be considered to enhance our knowledge of the impacts of climate change and develop effective interventions.\n","5971:  There is a need for greater understanding of the leadership role that health has to play in changing the behaviour of Canadians leading to both effective adaptation and mitigation efforts while recognizing the importance of implementing health adaptations within the health systems and increasing the advocacy role of health professionals with their patients.\n","5972:  It is critical to recognize the powerful influence that health considerations have to play in mitigation.\n","5973:  A recent report by researchers at the International Monetary Fund identifies the omission of health impacts from polluting fuels as the largest of the subsidies provided to global energy production and use, which will total US$5.3 trillion in 2015 (67).\n","5974:  This is larger than total health spending by all the worlds_ governments.\n","5975:  Therefore, the health implications could and should be more effectively harnessed in efforts to build support for a stronger response to climate change.\n","5976:  There is a need for horizontal understanding and participation for effective interventions with multiple co-benefits.\n","5977:  The built environment plays a vitally important role in promoting and maintaining health, so health considerations should be a key component of infrastructure discussions.\n","5978:  A strong health-based vision would be city planning that encourages reduced air pollution and thus supports and promotes lifestyles that are healthy for the individual and for the planet.\n","5979:  This is relevant to many interventions.\n","5980:  For example air pollution, where encouraging a transition to cities that support and promote lifestyles that are healthy for the individual and for the planet would have far-reaching impacts on chronic disease conditions (68).\n","5981:  There is a need to integrate health security considerations into upstream risk mitigation plans linked to health innovation, national security and climate change to as well as reinforce the mechanisms and systems to manage health emergency preparedness and response.\n","5982:  Given recognised increases in the frequency and/or intensity of extreme weather events and emerging infectious disease outbreaks, this preparedness and foresight is critical.\n","5983:  There is a need to define cross-cutting adaptations that provide resiliency to both outbreaks of infectious disease, and the mounting burden of non-communicable disease.\n","5984:  This can be achieved through the continued development of strong, flexible, and resilient health systems (69).\n","5985:  Moving strategically _upstream_ in our common understanding of the social determinants of health can enable and enhance the health of Canadian populations with considerations to health equity and patient-centered care.\n","5986:  This provides a strategic approach to scaling up systematic strengthening of the health system through targeted public health and population health approaches.\n","5987:  SCIENCE NARRATIVE I CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS ON THE HEALTH OF CANADIANS 24 There is a need to develop a long-term vision of health with considerations to the fundamental need for clean air and clean water to support the health of Canadian communities.\n","5988:  These include the strategic management of biodiversity to both protect the ecosystem services delivered in or natural environments, and in enhancing our One Health management of infectious diseases.\n","5989:  Adoption of mechanisms to facilitate collaboration between Ministries of Health and other government departments will empower health professionals and better integrate health and climate considerations in government-wide strategies.\n","5990:  This must acknowledge and seek to address the extent to which additional global environmental changes, such as deforestation, biodiversity loss, and ocean acidification, will impact on human health and decrease resilience to climate change.\n","5991:  Ecosystem-based adaptation utilises ecosystem services, biodiversity, and sustainable resource management as an adaptation strategy to enhance natural resilience and reduce vulnerability (70).\n","5992:  These interventions can be effective in reducing certain climate change vulnerability as they provide disaster risk reduction functions and enable improvements in livelihoods and food security, especially in poor and vulnerable settings.\n","5993:  There is a need to enhance mechanisms to evaluate the effectiveness and ability of interventions in reducing the burden of high priority climate sensitive diseases and health conditions.\n","5995:  It is important to be able to evaluate effectiveness through various outcome metrics including single interventions with multiple direct and indirect outcomes.\n","5996:  While implementation of effective control interventions is the only way to reduce the disease burden of climate change, evaluation of the effectiveness of public health interventions is lacking.\n","5997:  The health and well-being of populations is necessarily dependant on the resilience, adaptability and strength of interacting systems across all sectors.\n","5998:  This complex web of dependencies has become more acutely emphasised as the effects of a changing climate become more and more prominent in various dimensions.\n","5999:  Actions to mitigate the potential enormity of these impacts have been relatively slow.\n","6000:  Perhaps this is, in part, due to being stymied by the inherent complexity of how to proceed.\n","6001:  However, many authors argue that most mitigation and adaptation responses to climate change are _no-regret_ options, which lead to direct reductions in the burden of ill-health, enhance community resilience, alleviate poverty, and address global inequity.\n","6002:  Encouraging and supporting the integration of unique strengths and capacities from different sectors will address the challenges of complexity and move the agenda forward.\n","6003:  Innovation and foresight in creating and leading these opportunities should define future considerations in governance and actions towards successful adaptations for mitigating health impacts of climate change in Canada and globally.\n","6004:  SCIENCE NARRATIVE I CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS ON THE HEALTH OF

 Although all levels of government have important roles to play to advance adaptation, action at the local level is particularly important because that is where many of the impacts of climate change will be felt most directly.1 Local governments in Canada can manage the risks and opportunities presented by climate through a variety of practices, including adoption and enforcement of bylaws; collection of taxes and user fees; operation of transportation, utilities and other public infrastructure; establishment of subsidies, tax credits and other incentive programs; administration of emergency management and response systems; and public outreach and education initiatives.\n","6289:  Land use planning is one of the most effective processes to facilitate local adaptation to climate change.3,4 Historically, local governments have used land use planning tools _ official plans, zoning, development permits and others _ to minimize risks to communities from floods, wildfires, landslides and other natural hazards.5 As the climate changes, so will the frequency and magnitude of climate-related hazards, posing a challenge for community planners.\n","6290:  A recent survey by the Canadian Institute of Planners confirmed that _planners gravitate to tools they know best and are looking for ways to adapt known tools when addressing climate change._6 Adaptation defined Climate change adaptation refers to actions that reduce the negative impact of climate change and/ or take advantage of new opportunities.\n","6291:  It involves making adjustments in our decisions, activities and thinking because of observed or expected changes in climate.2 Some ways municipalities act _ planning and land use controls: zoning, official plans, development reviews _ provision of public services: utilities, public transit, road maintenance, snow removal, fire and police, emergency preparedness _ forum for public dialogue and information: public awareness campaigns, deliberation on bylaws and programs, information on city services _ collection of taxes and user fees: property taxes, recreational facility fees, parking fees _ management of public land and buildings: establishment of parks, renovation of civic buildings, operation of water treatment plants L A N D U S E P L A N N I N G T O O L S | 1 Planning tools and climate change risk reduction Generally speaking, planning tools can be used to reduce climate risks in four ways: _ limiting development in hazard-prone areas _ ensuring that the built environment can withstand a range of environmental stress _ helping to preserve natural environments that protect communities against hazards (for example, dunes that absorb coastal storm effects) _ educating stakeholders and decision makers about risks and opportunities and fostering dialogue about adaptation This document describes tools in the land use planning sector that communities can use in preparing to adapt to climate change.\n","6292:  In addition, it provides information on decision-support tools, tools that provide information and resources to help planners and local decision makers take effective adaptation action.\n","6293:  A brief example of each tool and its use by a Canadian community is given.\n","6294:  Not every case discussed here was explicitly motivated by a desire to adapt to climate change.\n","6295:  However, the significance of the tool to adaptation planning is clear in each case.\n","6296:  An effort was made to select examples from communities of varying sizes and from all regions of Canada.\n","6297:  Although the examples are of broad utility, the design and application of a particular planning tool can vary greatly from one jurisdiction to another, depending on provincial or territorial laws and other factors.\n","6299:  Readers interested in knowing how a particular tool is applied in a specific community should consult provincial, territorial and local laws.\n","6300:  It is important to keep in mind that land use planning is used to pursue many local policy objectives, including providing affordable housing, stimulating job growth, preserving the character and heritage of a community, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, protecting biodiversity and enabling efficient transportation.\n","6301:  A key challenge for planners and local decision makers is how to incorporate and balance the need to prepare for climate change through adaptation with other local development objectives.\n","6302:  Another consideration is how to integrate (mainstream) consideration of changing climate into the wide array of decisions made by local governments, from operating municipal services to capital spending, enforcement and inspection activities, collection of taxes, and administration of disaster response programs.\n","6303:  2 | L A N D U S E P L A N N I N G T O O L S 2 | L A N D U S E P L A N N I N G T O O L S S A M O H T A D A R A N F O Y S E T R U O C O T O H P 2.0 Land use planning tools This section describes seven of the most prominent land use planning tools in use across Canada and explains how communities can use them to more effectively adapt to climate change.\n","6304:  Land use planning refers to the processes and instruments employed to manage the use of land and the physical development of a community for the common interest.\n","6305:  A variety of statutory and other measures _ bylaws, incentives, information and guidance, spending programs _ may be applied to control how land is used.\n","6306:  The scale of action is usually the neighbourhood, a whole town or city or a metropolitan area.\n","6307:  Tools for the regulation of individual buildings, such as building codes, green building standards, property taxes and the like, are closely related to land use planning but are not covered in this document.\n","6309:  After the plan is finalized, the local council adopts it formally by enacting a bylaw.\n","6310:  Provincial approval may be required as well.\n","6312:  Official plans are in force for a relatively long period (10 years or longer) with updates required periodically (every five years in some provinces).\n","6313:  They may designate some areas of the community as appropriate locations for new growth while others are to be preserved or revitalised.\n","6314:  Official plans serve as guiding documents for subsequent local policies, programs and bylaws (such as zoning codes and subdivision controls).\n","6315:  Climate change adaptation can be incorporated directly into a municipality_s official plan, either in a dedicated section or embedded throughout the document.\n","6316:  Such texts normally detail local climate change risks and opportunities, an overarching adaptation vision and policy, as well as priority adaptation needs.\n","6318:  D D N N A A L L U U O O M M Y Y R R R R E E J J F F O O Y Y S S E E T T R R U U O O C C O O T T O O H H P P Iqaluit_s General Plan8 Iqaluit (population 6200), the capital of Nunavut, is one of the first Canadian communities to integrate climate change adaptation into its General Plan.\n","6319:  One of the five priority vision statements identifies Iqaluit as _a community that adapts to climate change._ The plan sets out two high-level objectives to realize this vision: (1) to study the impacts of climate change on the community and (2) to adopt policies that recognize the long-term impacts of climate change.\n","6320:  The plan includes more detail on the climate change issues of concern to the community (for example, increases in temperature and precipitation, permafrost thaw, decreases in sea ice, and accelerated coastal erosion) and priority adaptation actions related to municipal infrastructure.\n","6321:  L O T R E B E L E H C I M F O Y S E T R U O C O T O H P 4 | L A N D U S E P L A N N I N G T O O L S Elkford_s Official Community Plan9,10 The District of Elkford is a small community (population 2500) in the Rocky Mountains of southeastern British Columbia.\n","6322:  Historically, Elkford has dealt with several climate-related hazards, including flooding, drought and wildfires.\n","6323:  A changing climate magnifies all these risks.\n","6324:  In 2008, Elkford, with support of the Columbia Basin Trust, a provincial crown corporation, developed a local adaptation strategy to assess the risks posed by climate change and identify corresponding adaptation actions.\n","6325:  The Adaptation Strategy was developed concurrently with a revision to Elkford_s Official Community Plan (OCP), allowing the two to be fully integrated.\n","6326:  Consideration of climate change in all decision making is one of the OCP_s 11 guiding principles.\n","6328:  The OCP also calls for the development of a community evacuation plan in the event of an extreme wildfire or flooding.\n","6329:  D R O F K L E F O T C I R T S I D F O Y S E T R U O C O T O H P L A N D U S E P L A N N I N G T O O L S | 5 2.2 LOCAL PLANS ON SPECIAL MATTERS In addition to official plans, local governments adopt many other kinds of plans.\n","6330:  Those plans may focus on one function of local government (such as public transit or storm water management), on a sector or issue of special significance to the community (such as the development of the arts or the needs of senior citizens) or on a neighbourhood with special planning needs.11 As with official plans, these local plans are often developed through a formal planning process, including public consultation, and provide an assessment of conditions, a long-term vision and a set of goals and actions for the particular issue or area in question.\n","6331:  A growing number of Canadian municipalities have adopted plans that specifically address the need to adapt to climate change.\n","6332:  Some communities have chosen to develop stand-alone adaptation plans.\n","6333:  Those documents typically outline the climate change impacts of concern to the community, the associated risks and opportunities, and the community_s vision and proposed actions for dealing with those changes.\n","6334:  Many other communities have integrated consideration of climate change adaptation into local plans that address other issues.\n","6335:  For example, a municipality may integrate adaptation into its capital improvement plan for storm water sewer systems.\n","6336:  Stratford_s Climate Change Adaptation Plan12 The Town of Stratford (population 8046), a rapidly growing community in Prince Edward Island, is located on a peninsula just south of the provincial capital, Charlottetown.\n","6338:  In 2010, the Town, in partnership with the Canadian Institute of Planners and the Atlantic Planners Institute, created a long-term strategic plan to prepare Stratford for climate change.\n","6339:  The process comprised four stages: (1) forming a core working group to establish overarching objectives, engage key stakeholders and conduct background research into local climate change impacts; (2) organizing public meetings to assess current and future vulnerabilities (following a presentation of the potential climate change impacts, a survey was distributed to all participants at the public meeting to gauge climate change-related opportunities and threats for the community); (3) conducting a risk assessment, building on results of the vulnerability assessment, to rank the most important climate change impacts and identify priority areas for adaptation action; and (4) preparing a final adaptation plan that included recommended adaptation actions by theme (for example, heritage properties, parks and recreation, private properties, emergency services, storm water infrastructure).\n","6340:  Stratford has since integrated adaptation considerations into all new or updated community action plans, including its draft Official Plan, Strategic Plan and Master Stormwater Management Plan.\n","6341:  D N U A M N O T S N I W F O Y S E T R U O C O T O H P 6 | L A N D U S E P L A N N I N G T O O L S Edmonton_s Urban Forest Management Plan13 Edmonton (population 812 201), the capital of Alberta, is located along the North Saskatchewan River.\n","6342:  The city_s urban tree canopy is seriously threatened by drought, insect infestations, disease, storms and climate change.\n","6343:  These threats spurred Edmonton to create the Urban Forest Management Plan (UFMP) to guide the management of the tree canopy over a 10-year period.\n","6344:  The UFMP includes developing an inventory of the urban forest (completed 2009), a review of existing planting strategies, a communication plan and potential tree planting partnerships.\n","6345:  Many of these actions will increase resilience to drought conditions, which may be exacerbated by climate change.\n","6346:  For example, Edmonton_s Forestry Unit is testing the use of different tree species, such as red maples, and alternative tree watering techniques.\n","6347:  N O T N O M D E F O Y T I C E H T F O Y S E T R U O C O T O H P imagineCALGARY14 Calgary (population 1 096 833) is situated in southern Alberta.\n","6348:  The impact of climate change on water quality and quantity is of particular concern in the area.\n","6349:  Local rivers are expected to experience decreased flow because of decreased precipitation and reduced glacial coverage in the headwaters of the river basins.15 imagineCALGARY was a community visioning and consultation process undertaken in 2005 to produce a 100-year roadmap for Calgary_s development.\n","6350:  The process engaged more than 18 000 Calgarians representing businesses, community agencies, non-profits and governments as well as the public.\n","6351:  Calgary is one of the first communities in Canada to consider climate change in its long-range planning.\n","6352:  The City commissioned scoping reports to investigate how four major trends might impact the city: demographic changes, resource scarcity, technology transformation and climate change.\n","6353:  Since publishing the imagineCALGARY plan in 2007, the City has implemented its vision and targets in subsequent land use plans and strategies.\n","6354:  Numerous local partner organizations in the private, non-profit and public sectors have also committed to achieving the vision by changing their policies and practices.\n","6355:  N O S N H O J A L O C I N F O Y S E T R U O C O T O H P L A N D U S E P L A N N I N G T O O L S | 7 2.3 ZONING Zoning is a regulatory tool widely used by municipalities to control land use within their borders.7,16,17,18 It is a key tool for implementing the goals and objectives set out in a municipality_s official plan.\n","6357:  For each zone, only certain land uses are permitted (for example, commercial, residential, industrial).\n","6358:  In addition to restrictions on the use of the property, the zoning bylaws may impose requirements on buildings, including maximum height, lot coverage and density, as well as building type and setbacks.\n","6359:  Those requirements are reflected in a zoning map for the jurisdiction.\n","6361:  Beaubassin-est_s sea level rise protection zone23 Beaubassin-est (population 6200), a small coastal community in southeast New Brunswick, is vulnerable to the impacts of sea level rise and storm surge flooding.\n","6362:  The Community is one of the first in New Brunswick to implement a minimum height standard for buildings to address climate change impacts.\n","6363:  Council passed an updated zoning bylaw in March 2011 to better protect new construction in the community_s coastal zone.\n","6364:  The bylaw identifies a sea level rise _protection zone_ in which

revised its comprehensive zoning bylaw to include four regulatory measures aimed at tackling urban heat islands: (1) when replacing an existing roof or constructing a new building, the owner must install either a green roof or a highly reflective roof; (2) for all new parking lots of 10 or more spaces, at least 15 percent of the area must be open ground landscaped with plants, bushes and trees; (3) all new paving materials must meet a minimum specified surface reflectivity rating; and (4) when constructing a new building, at least 20 percent of the building site must remain open ground and be landscaped with plants, bushes and trees.\n","6374:  These four measures apply to all public and private property throughout the borough.\n","6375:  More than 300 permits for reflective

community.\n","6378:  Further, the developer may be required to pay development charges, dedicate a portion of the site for public use or provide some other concession or amenity.\n","6379:  These project-based, discretionary development controls can be very useful for adapting to climate change at the neighbourhood scale.\n","6380:  For example, as part of the review of a subdivision proposal, the developer may be asked to assess the increased risk of erosion due to climate change and to determine how it may affect the development.\n","6381:  The municipality may require that appropriate adaptation measures be taken by the developer, such as shoreline restoration or increased development setbacks.\n","6382:  The lots in a proposed subdivision may be clustered in the least hazardous part of the property.\n","6383:  In other cases, a site plan control ordinance may be used to require that green design features that address the impacts of climate change be incorporated (for instance, providing shade and rooftop gardens to decrease the public health risk from urban heat islands).\n","6384:  _ subdivision controls _ which apply when a developer wants to divide a parcel of land, often for residential development.\n","6385:  Generally, subdivision plans must demonstrate good access and efficient utility service for all the proposed lots and also address concerns about financial, environmental and other impacts.\n","6386:  _ site plan controls, development permits, development agreements and similar tools _ which require developers to submit detailed designs to be assessed against specified criteria.\n","6387:  For example, a proposal may be reviewed for the quality of the design of public areas, the fit with the historic character of the neighbourhood, or the

of pests and diseases (such as West Nile virus) and more extreme rainfall with consequences for storm-water systems and other infrastructure.26 The Toronto Green Standard (TGS) is a set of performance measures for site and building design, covering energy and water efficiency, air and water quality, ecological services and solid waste management.\n","6391:  The standards work with the regular development approval and inspection process, and apply to all new development subject to subdivision or site plan controls or for which a zoning amendment is required.27 Although adaptation is not explicitly mentioned, the TGS addresses several climate change impacts of concern to the city.\n","6392:  For example, one provision, applicable to non-residential development of three stories or less, requires the use of light-coloured materials, open-grid pavement or shading on at least 50 percent of the site to reduce urban heat.\n","6393:  Another provision requires that new developments retain at least the first 5 millimetres (mm) from each rainfall through rainwater reuse, plantings and other practices, thereby reducing storm water runoff.\n","6394:  A more stringent set of

to bring more frequent storms to the area, will likely increase the vulnerability of coastal development and infrastructure.28 Various community plans, including the 2006 HRM Regional Plan, already call for new developments to be constructed a minimum height above the ordinary high-water mark.29 One flexible mechanism that planners in Halifax use to address coastal threats is development agreements.\n","6398:  Certain areas of the community are designated as zones where review and approval of development projects proceed through negotiation.\n","6400:  In a recent development in downtown Dartmouth (an HRM municipality), local officials and the developer agreed to establish minimum elevations for a new marina and other seaside structures that were several metres higher than

formal agreements that place restrictions on the use of land or grant a person (or the public) the right to use land owned by another.31,32 For example, a covenant may prohibit building a structure that casts a shadow on a neighbouring property.\n","6404:  An easement may allow the public to pass through private land to reach a beach.\n","6405:  Both covenants and easements are said to _run with the land,_ which means they bind current as well as future owners.\n","6407:  Covenants may serve local planning goals in different ways: _ as a development control tool _ Municipalities may use covenants when entering development agreements, applying controls on subdivisions and other development projects or imposing conditions on issuing a development permit.\n","6408:  In such cases, these instruments ensure that community interests are protected and that the developer_s promises about the operation and maintenance of the property are enforceable long after construction.\n","6409:  Covenants may be used in _green developments_ that use innovative energy, waste water treatment and other systems that require public access and the collaboration of future owners for proper operation and maintenance.33 _ as a conservation tool _ A special form of covenant, known as a conservation covenant or easement has been established by law in many provinces.\n","6410:  It places restrictions on the use of land to protect its natural values.\n","6411:  For example, a conservation covenant may prohibit the removal of native vegetation and prohibit any structures on a portion of the property that contains sensitive ecosystems.\n","6412:  The owner who enters into a conservation covenant continues to own the land and may live on it, sell it, or pass it on to heirs but the covenant_s restrictions on development are followed in the future, regardless of who owns the land.34 In exchange, the land owner may be eligible for tax reductions or credits.\n","6413:  Covenants and easements can play an important role in climate change adaptation planning.\n","6414:  For example, a municipality may acquire a conservation easement to prevent residential development on a coastal area threatened by sea level rise and storm surge flooding.\n","6415:  A covenant may be negotiated with owners in an area to prevent construction of docks, sea walls or other coastal protection structures in order to allow marshes and dunes to migrate inland naturally.35 Covenants and easements may also support local efforts to monitor climate change by, for example, allowing access to a coastal property for purposes of measuring erosion rates.\n","6416:  S E L A Z N O G .\n","6417:  E F O Y S E T R U O C O T O H P Island Trust_s NAPTEP Covenant The Islands Trust (population 25 000) is a

example, buildings, public areas, infrastructure, mechanical systems, landscaping).\n","6431:  Municipalities may develop design guidelines for several reasons: to improve environmental performance, reduce infrastructure costs, enhance aesthetics, increase public safety or create more accessible public spaces.\n","6433:  A combination of text and photographs, sketches and architectural drawings describe preferred designs.\n","6434:  Municipalities often develop these publications as supplementary educational tools to help developers, design professionals (such as architects, landscape architects, engineers and planners) or the general public to improve upon existing design and construction practices.\n","6435:  They also illustrate various ways in which developers may meet required municipal or provincial development standards.\n","6437:  The design of a community_s physical components _ such as parking lots, parks and roadways, drainage ditches or a neighbourhood as a whole _ can reduce or magnify the impacts of climate change at the local scale.41,42 Good design can contribute to building resilience to climate change at the local level.43 For example, selecting appropriate building materials and landscaping can reduce the risk of wildfires.\n","6438:  Although many municipalities have developed design guidelines without climate change in mind, their use can improve resilience to the impacts of climate change.\n","6439:  Conversely, design guidelines may recommend or impose development standards that may inadvertently decrease resilience to climate change.\n","6440:  For example, a municipality may prescribe building wide roads to accommodate emergency vehicles.\n","6441:  However, those wide roads may also increase storm water volumes and

boundaries.\n","6453:  Traditionally, parking lot design has been based mainly on functional criteria (to maximize parking lot spaces and minimize maintenance costs) with little regard to the quality of the urban design or environmental performance.\n","6454:  The new guidelines provide design options and strategies, in both graphic and written form, to meet the following objectives: enhance the safety and attractiveness of the public realm, provide shade and high-quality landscaping, reduce the urban heat island effect, manage storm-water quality and quantity on-site, and incorporate sustainable material and technologies.\n","6455:  All proposals for new parking lots within city limits, both public and private, must consider the guidelines before receiving development approval.\n","6457:  Although not designed explicitly as a climate change adaptation measure, the application of the guidelines, particularly the urban heat island and storm-water management measures,

to provincial EA requirements.\n","6465:  In 2003, the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency issued guidelines for incorporating climate change considerations in EAs, one of the first federal agencies in the world to do so.47 EAs, EISs and other forms of environmental review have proven to be ready platforms for consideration of climate change concerns.\n","6466:  The applicable legislation and guidelines for EAs and EISs may require that local climate change be incorporated as one aspect of the natural environment to be considered and that measures to address climate change impacts be incorporated into the project_s design and management plan.\n","6467:  In other cases, climate change impacts may not be a direct consideration in the EA process.\n","6468:  Despite this, measures enacted in response to the EA may help build resilience to a changing climate.\n","6469:  In addition, municipalities can require formal environmental reviews, sometimes called environmental

process, the Town conducted a Municipal Engineers Class EA to evaluate various retrofit measures.52 The EA recommended a two-stage action plan involving (1) adopting _Healthy Community Practices,_ such as more strategic street sweeping practices, low-impact development approaches, community education programs and ongoing storm-water quality monitoring; and (2) using results from the monitoring program to determine whether engineered measures, such as retrofits to sewers, trenches and channel expansions, are needed.\n","6480:  Further, pursuant to environmental and climate change adaptation policies in its Official Plan, Ajax requires that an EIS be submitted with all applications for developments on land designated as a natural heritage or hydrologic features of provincial, regional or

steps in the local adaptation planning process is an assessment of how climate change affects a community.\n","6488:  Assessments can take several forms.i Some emphasize projections of climate change impacts in the community, while others focus on the factors that produce local vulnerability and constrain the ability of the community to take adaptive actions.\n","6489:  The knowledge gained through vulnerability and risk assessments can help decision makers develop effective adaptation measures.\n","6490:  Many guidelines and frameworks have been developed to help communities undertake local climate change assessments.57 Some are generic tools that may apply generally to all communities, while others are targeted to certain types of communities (for example, rural communities) or particular forms of climate change impacts (for example, heat-related health risks).\n","6491:  Many forms of knowledge, including scientific and technical expertise and local and traditional knowledge, can contribute to local assessments of climate change impacts and adaptation.\n","6492:  VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENTS A vulnerability assessment is a structured process for identifying the vulnerability of human and natural systems to climate change.58 The more exposed and sensitive an individual or community is to climate change, the higher its vulnerability.\n","6493:  Vulnerability is also a function of adaptive capacity; the higher a community_s capacity to undertake adaptive actions, the less vulnerable it is.\n","6494:  When conducting a vulnerability assessment, a broad range of socio-economic and physical factors should be considered, including climate conditions, the adequacy of housing and local infrastructure, the quality of emergency response systems and assistance networks, the availability of material and financial resources, and the general health and risk awareness of the population.59,60 Consultation with local stakeholders and residents is crucial in assessments, both to understand existing vulnerabilities and to develop effective strategies to reduce them.\n","6495:  The information gained from vulnerability assessments allows local officials to develop appropriate interventions such as improved health services, better access to transportation networks, and healthier buildings and urban spaces.\n","6496:  The assessments also help to prioritize measures to assist the most vulnerable individuals and groups in a timely and cost-effective manner.\n","6497:  RISK MANAGEMENT Risk management is a process widely used by businesses, governments and non-governmental organizations to identify and manage the adverse impacts of a change in conditions.\n","6498:  The magnitude of a risk is calculated by examining the probability of the occurrence of an event and the severity of its impact.\n","6499:  Risk management helps decision makers evaluate multiple threats and prioritize policy responses under conditions of uncertainty.\n","6500:  Risk management processes can be used by a community to evaluate risks associated with climate change and suggest adaptation measures.\n","6501:  Risk management methodologies can provide a way to explore public attitudes and perceptions of risk, and this information can feed back into the assessment.\n","6502:  The evaluation process may be formal or informal and may be quantitative or qualitative, depending on what works best for the municipality.\n","6503:  In addition to common risk management processes (for example, ISO31000, CSA Q850), which can be used to assess climate change risks, several climate change-specific risk assessment tools have been developed to assist Canadian communities (see Appendix A).\n","6504:  i The IPCC56 described several distinct conceptual frameworks for assessments of local climate change, including impact-based approaches that are climate scenario driven, adaptation-based approaches that focus on the capacity of communities and natural systems to respond effectively to stress, vulnerability-based approaches centered on the factors driving the susceptibility of individuals and groups to harm, integrated approaches that include modelling and other procedures for investigating climate change across sectors and scales and risk management approaches that focus directly on decision making.\n","6505:  L A

O L S Halifax Harbour plan for sea level rise68,69 Halifax (population 390 000), the capital of Nova Scotia, is a major seaport with significant industrial, military and municipal infrastructure on the coast.\n","6541:  Rising sea level, along with increased storm intensity and associated waves and storm surges, presents risks to residents, property and infrastructure in coastal areas of the city.\n","6542:  To respond to these impacts, in 2006 the city recognized the need to gather scientific data on sea level rise, storm surges and vulnerability to inform development of an area-specific land use plan for Halifax Harbour.\n","6543:  City planners partnered with a team of scientists to develop projections of future sea levels and storm water levels in Halifax Harbour under three climate scenarios for 2100: (1) a continuation of the historical rate of change, (2) the upper-limit projection for mean sea level rise from the fourth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and (3) a projection based on more recent scientific literature.\n","6544:  High-resolution mapping of possible future flood levels was then produced for each scenario.\n","6545:  Following a presentation by scientists and city staff, Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM) Council in 2010 chose scenario 2c as a policy reference point from which to develop the adaptation strategy.\n","6546:  HRM is also committed to re-examining this choice when additional scientific information becomes available.\n","6547:  This example demonstrates that credible climate projections, based on best available science that are communicated to the public and decision makers in a format that is easily understandable, provide a helpful foundation for adaptation action at the municipal level.\n","6548:  S E B R O F N O D F O Y S E T R U O C E G A M I - C 2 O I R A N E C S L A N D U S E P L A N N I N G T O O L S | 23 Climate projections informing adaptation planning in Prince George The City of Prince George (population 77 000) is situated at the confluence of the Nechako and upper Fraser rivers in central British Columbia.\n","6550:  In 2008, the City partnered with the University of Northern British Columbia (UNBC)70 to mainstream climate change adaptation into the city_s policies and programs.\n","6551:  The City and UNBC partnered with the Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium at the University of Victoria to produce a climate trends and projections report specific to the Prince George region.71 The report assessed historical trends (1918 to 2006) for precipitation, temperature and stream flow as well as projected changes (for the 2020s, 2050s and 2080s) in temperature and precipitation using global climate models.\n","6552:  UNBC and the City organized two adaptation workshops and other information events that brought together city staff, the public and key stakeholders to discuss approaches to dealing with climate change impacts.\n","6553:  Climate experts from PCIC presented a summary of the projections at the workshops.\n","6554:  Participants were asked to discuss the potential social, economic and environmental implications of the projected changes for Prince George and define key impacts for the city.\n","6555:  The climate change projections were a useful tool for establishing a credible baseline from which workshop participants could engage and discuss impacts and adaptation actions.\n","6556:  Prince George has since integrated the findings from the workshops, including recommended measures to reduce risks from forest fires and flooding, into the Integrated Community Sustainability Plan72 and draft Official Community Plan.\n","6557:  E G R O E G E C N I R P F O Y T I C F O Y S E T R U O C O T O H P 24 | L A N D U S E P L A N N I N G T O O L S 3.3 SCENARIO PLANNING A scenario is a plausible, simplified description of how the future may develop.\n","6558:  Scenario planning is a strategic medium- to long-term planning tool in which planners develop multiple scenarios describing potential social, economic and environmental conditions in a community and then formulate strategies and measures to achieve planning goals under one or more of those scenarios.73 Long used by government and the private sector for managing uncertainty, scenario planning is now being applied by some communities to prepare for climate change.\n","6559:  In planning for adaptation to climate change, planners devise scenarios that demonstrate how changes in climate may affect the community under different development trajectories (see the diagram in the following Whitehorse example).\n","6560:  The development trajectories are based on a few key variables expected to drive change, such as population growth, technological shifts or energy demand.\n","6561:  Different narratives about how climate change may unfold in the community are derived from scientific projections, expert assessments and other sources.74 Planning scenarios assist adaptation planning and policy- making in several ways.\n","6562:  The process of constructing the scenarios educates stakeholders about the nature and extent of future climate-related risks and opportunities.\n","6563:  Scenarios may provide information that helps to identify emerging vulnerabilities (for example, potential conflict over access to water) and support efforts to prioritize climate change risks.\n","6564:  They also assist in devising adaptation strategies and actions to address vulnerabilities.\n","6566:  For example, in communities at risk from wildfires, proper firebreak maintenance can be a useful adaptation measure regardless of the magnitude of climate change experienced and the rate of development.\n","6567:  In other cases, planners may develop contingent adaptation strategies that would be implemented in the event a particular scenario begins to unfold.75 Whitehorse Community Climate Change Adaptation Project Whitehorse (population 25 690) is the capital of Yukon and, like other northern communities, already faces many climate-related impacts, including forest fires, flooding and ecosystem changes.\n","6568:  To help the community prepare for future climate changes, a scenario planning project was conducted in 2009, led by a local college in collaboration with the territorial government, local and First Nations governments, private sector firms and community groups.76,77 In a series of meetings, members of the community identified local vulnerabilities under four possible _future histories_ of Whitehorse.\n","6569:  To create those histories, two climate change scenarios and two development scenarios were generated.\n","6570:  For instance, Scenario 4, entitled City of Crossroads, envisions a high degree of climate change (median temperature rise of 4_C) as well as significant population growth (24 000 new residents).\n","6572:  Participants brainstormed on the social, economic and environmental consequences associated with each scenario.\n","6573:  Certain impacts or concerns that were common across the four histories were deemed to be consequences most likely to occur and therefore became priorities for developing adaptation actions.\n","6574:  The priorities included increased risk of forest fire, shifts in the availability of water, infrastructure decline, energy and food security, and potential land use conflicts.\n","6575:  The study also allowed planners to identify the range of impacts that any one adaptation measure could address and how these measures may fit with other planning initiatives.\n","6576:  Climate changes (e.g.\n","6577:  extent of temperature rise and increase in snow) some climate change lots of climate change

documents.\n","6580:  Increasingly, municipalities employ computer animation software to create three-dimensional visualizations at the street and neighbourhood scales.\n","6581:  The software combines images of the existing features of the community (for example, roads, buildings and trees near the shore) with climate-related impacts projected for the area (for example, higher sea level).\n","6583:  For example, planners may want to create an image showing how raising a dike or levee would affect views of the ocean from various waterfront properties.\n","6584:  The resulting images may be useful in engaging the affected land owners and the public when evaluating the merits of a proposed adaptation measure, such as raising a sea dike.\n","6585:  H T L A E H C I L B U P O T

changes expected in the local climate, the severity of possible impacts, and what proposed adaptation responses might look like.\n","6587:  They can facilitate dialogue during the planning process.\n","6589:  They can range from simple hand-drawn maps to those developed by using sophisticated computer software.\n","6590:  Maps have been used to identify geographic areas of the municipality at risk from climate-related impacts, the location of vulnerable infrastructure and populations, or to demarcate places where certain adaptation-related policies apply.\n","6591:  For example, the potential extent of shoreline erosion or storm surge flooding under various climate change scenarios Toronto_s heat vulnerability mapping tool79 As the climate changes, Toronto is

respiratory illnesses and to other vulnerable populations.\n","6593:  Toronto Public Health (TPH) has developed a mapping tool to visualize areas of elevated human vulnerability to extreme heat.\n","6595:  The tool helps TPH and community partners identify and prioritize geographic hot spots for delivering resources during a heat alert.\n","6596:  The City also plans to use the tool for

many matters of local concern including land use planning.87,88 Accordingly, Provinces play a role in land use planning for local adaptation to climate change through _ enabling legislation _ Provinces enact and revise laws that guide planning by local and regional authorities.\n","6633:  For example, provincial planning acts prescribe the kinds of zoning bylaws a municipality may adopt.\n","6635:  _ provincial planning policies _ Provinces adopt regulations and policies, to which local and regional plans generally must conform, on planning issues of concern across the province.\n","6636:  Those policies may address topics relevant to local adaptation efforts.\n","6637:  For instance, a province may prescribe planning standards designed to protect agricultural land and contain urbanization at the fringes of a metropolitan area.\n","6638:  Those standards may facilitate enhanced regional food security and the design of more resilient urban communities.\n","6639:  _ provincial adaptation plans and programs _ Many provinces have their own formal plans for adapting to climate change.\n","6640:  Typically, such plans specify provincial goals and objectives; identify the impacts of climate change on government programs, operations and infrastructure; and suggest specific actions.\n","6641:  For example, a plan may call for more high- definition aerial mapping or enhanced monitoring of water quality.\n","6642:  Provinces also disseminate guidelines and technical information and can act as facilitators and conveners to assist local governments, the private sector and civic organizations in adapting to climate change.\n","6643:  Finally, provinces fund programs that can support local adaptation (for example, subsidies for an urban tree planting program to reduce the urban heat island effect).\n","6644:  _ direct involvement in development decisions _ In most local planning matters, the provincial government plays an indirect, oversight role (for instance, as appellate bodies on a zoning dispute or as the final approving authority on local official plans).\n","6645:  In some circumstances, provincial officials are directly involved in local development decisions.\n","6646:  This may be the case for sites and issues that fall under direct provincial jurisdiction, such as highway construction, unincorporated communities, local projects on crown land, projects affecting heritage properties, and environmental assessments of large infrastructure projects.\n","6647:  In such cases, provincial officials may contribute directly to decisions on the design and implementation of local adaptation measures.\n","6649:  In that capacity, a province can help set the conditions for participation by local governments in programs that support or complement adaptation.\n","6650:  An example is the set of agreements between the Government of Canada and various provinces governing the allocation of federal gas-tax funds.\n","6651:  The nature and extent of provincial involvement in local adaptation planning varies between provinces, depending on legal and institutional frameworks, the planning culture and practice of each location, and many other factors.\n","6652:  TERRITORIES Like provincial governments, the governments of the territories of Nunavut, the Northwest Territories and Yukon have jurisdiction over land use planning and many other local matters.\n","6653:  However, these legislative powers do not spring directly from the Constitution but instead are delegated to the territories by the Government of Canada under various laws.89,90,91 Territorial governments in turn enact legislation and adopt policies to guide planning by local and regional authorities within their borders.92,93 30 | L A N D U S E P L A N N I N G T O O L S While the legal framework for land use planning in the territories differs from that in the provinces, the roles that territorial governments play in adaptation to climate change roughly correspond to those described in the Provinces section of this appendix.\n","6654:  For example, territorial governments also adopt climate change strategies and actions plans.94,95,96 Territorial land-use planning practices and territorial government involvement in local adaptation planning vary by territory, depending on the enabling federal legislation and other factors.\n","6655:  British Columbia_s Climate Action Plan97 British Columbia released its Climate Action Plan in June 2008.\n","6656:  Chapter 5 describes the Province_s vision, strategies and activities as it prepares for climate change.\n","6657:  In responding to the increased likelihood of severe weather events, the provincial government is taking action to (1) ensure that new development on flood plains will be flood-proofed to provincial standards, (2) consider the impacts of climate change when awarding provincial infrastructure grants, (3) develop a comprehensive plan for green community development and (4) ensure that community development strategies recognize the importance of streams and rivers.\n","6658:  The Province is currently updating its planning policy statements and guidelines, including the Guidelines for Management of Coastal Flood Hazard Land Use.\n","6660:  The strategy adopts a risk-based approach to adaptation as it _is the most practical way to ensure that adaptation responses are socially acceptable, cost-effective and consistent with the community_s wider social, environmental and economic goals._ The impacts of climate change on coasts _ such as sea level rise, increased storm surge flooding and erosion _ are highlighted as issues of concern.\n","6661:  The strategy identifies five overarching adaptation objectives and actions, all of which have direct implications at the municipal level.\n","6662:  For example, the Province committed to reviewing all provincial land use and development policies to encourage more sustainable options for future land development and to better adapt to changing climate conditions.\n","6663:  Manitoba_s Provincial Planning Regulation Manitoba_s Provincial Planning Regulation100 (the Regulation) identifies both climate change mitigation and adaptation as strategic priorities, along with other key concerns such as clean water and public safety.\n","6664:  Community resilience is recognized as a key principle of sound land use planning.\n","6665:  The Regulation identifies issues of provincial interest to be addressed in local development plans and goals to be pursued in various policy areas.\n","6666:  For instance, with respect to general development policy, the provincial interest includes directing development toward areas where risk can be minimized and taking into account climate change vulnerabilities.\n","6667:  With regard to water, provincial interest includes the development of strategies to prioritize allocation and implementation of conservation measures to build community resilience.\n","6668:  The Regulation prohibits certain kinds of development in or near water bodies and prescribes minimum setbacks for new development.\n","6669:  The policy on planning for agriculture recognizes the potential increased demand for food production in response to climate change and encourages local authorities to promote food security.\n","6670:  At a strategic level, the Regulation requires that each local planning authority assess local vulnerabilities to climate change and consider existing climate change action plans when preparing, amending or replacing the local development plan.\n","6671:  L A N D U S E P L A N N I N G T O O L S | 31 Appendix B Additional resources on select decision-support tools VISUALIZING CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS

However, there are many ways to reduce your home_s risk of fooding, and not all of them are diffcult or expensive.\n","7383:  This guide briefy describes some of the smaller, lower cost actions you can take yourself or with minor assistance from others.\n","7384:  It also suggests places you can go to fnd more information about food mitigation techniques, including some of these.\n","7386:  As you begin to think about which might be the best for you and your home, consider following these three key steps: 1.\n","7387:  Know Your Risk.\n","7388:  Anywhere it can rain, it can food_so we all live in a food zone, and we all live with the risk of food damage to our property.\n","7389:  Learn more details about your home_s level of food risk, including the type of food zone it is in and, if available, the potential food elevation (referred to as the _base food elevation_ on a food map).\n","7390:  A good place to start is FEMA_s online Flood Map Service Center at .\n","7391:  You can also visit the offcials in your community who maintain the FEMA food maps and elevation certifcates; they may work in the local planning and zoning offce or in the building department.\n","7392:  Talk to them, your neighbors, and others about any past food events and how high the water has risen in the past at or near your home.\n","7393:  Insure Your Property.\n","7394:  As a homeowner, it_s important to insure your home and personal belongings.\n","7395:  Even if your home is in a low- or moderate-risk food zone, purchasing a food insurance policy is highly recommended.\n","7396:  It provides you with fnancial protection from a food event.\n","7397:  Flood damage isn_t covered by standard homeowners insurance policies, and just a few inches of foodwater can end up costing thousands of dollars in repairs.\n","7398:  More than 25 percent of food insurance claims come from properties that are not in an identifed high-risk zone, but most homeowners in these areas are eligible for coverage at a preferred rate.\n","7400:  Reduce Your Risk.\n","7401:  Decide how to prepare your family and protect your home from fooding.\n","7402:  Consider which of the methods included in this guide are most appropriate and practical, based on your home_s food risk, and create a plan to mitigate the risk to your property.\n","7403:  Even after a mitigation project, some risk will remain, so learn about more actions to prepare and protect your family, home, and belongings at www.ready.gov/make-a-plan.\n","7404:  Please be aware that food mitigation measures need to be tailored to the property in question.\n","7405:  Depending on the project, you may need to consult local architects, engineers, contractors, landscapers, or other experts in design and construction.\n","7406:  Also, changes to properties and buildings often require permits or other regulatory approvals.\n","7407:  Your local planning and zoning offce or building department is a good place to start for advice on how to best proceed.\n","7408:  Lastly, please remember to be kind to your neighbors!\n","7409:  Consulting adjacent property owners is very important when any actions on your property, such as extending downspouts or regrading areas between homes, could affect their property.\n","7410:  _ Install a rain barrel.\n","7411:  A rain barrel is an alternative method for dealing with rainwater.\n","7412:  Rain barrels are typically connected to gutter downspouts and collect the runoff from roofs.\n","7413:  You can use this stored water for non-potable uses such as watering the lawn and gardens or washing your car.\n","7414:  _ Elevate utilities and service equipment.\n","7415:  Raise and anchor air conditioning condensers, heat pumps, water meters and other service equipment onto pedestals or platforms that are at least 1 foot above the potential food elevation.\n","7416:  For identifed high-risk zones this means going to or above the regulatory food elevation for the property as adopted by the local community.\n","7417:  This inexpensive action can help prevent signifcant damage and disruption following a food event.\n","7418:  _ Anchor outdoor fuel tanks.\n","7419:  Attach outdoor fuel tanks to a large concrete slab that weighs enough to resist the force of foodwaters, or install inexpensive ground anchors that are connected across the top of the tank with metal straps.\n","7420:  Unanchored fuel tanks can be easily moved and ruptured by foodwaters and pose serious threats to people, property, and the environment.\n","7421:  If located in an identifed high- risk zone, fuel tanks should also be elevated to or above the regulatory food elevation as adopted by the local community.\n","7422:  If not feasible then all flling and ventilation tubes should be elevated so that foodwaters cannot enter the tank.\n","7423:  OUTSIDE THE HOME For the exterior areas of your property, consider taking the following actions: _ Maintain proper water runoff and drainage.\n","7424:  Routinely clean and maintain gutters, downspouts, and splashpads so that rainwater from your roof fows easily away from your home.\n","7425:  Also, make sure that any nearby drainage ditches or storm drains are clear of debris and functioning properly.\n","7426:  _ Improve lot grading.\n","7427:  Determine how water fows or accumulates around your home to identify potential trouble spots (often easy to see during an average rainstorm).\n","7428:  Stormwater should always drain away from the building; if necessary, change your landscaping to improve runoff.\n","7429:  This may include building up any sunken areas around the foundation, digging small depressions to properly channel water, and otherwise improving the yard so that it slopes away from your home.\n","7430:  _ Reduce impervious surfaces around your home.\n","7431:  Water runs off concrete and asphalt almost immediately and can exceed the capacity of storm sewers quickly during heavy rains.\n","7432:  Retaining and creating natural green space around your home can help reduce sewer overfows by reducing stormwater runoff.\n","7433:  Consider options such as rain gardens, vegetated swales, or pervious pavements, which allow more water to be absorbed by the ground.\n","7434:  INSIDE THE HOME For interior areas below the potential food elevation, consider making the following alterations: _ Protect your valuable possessions.\n","7435:  Move important documents and other valuable or sentimental items to a safer location, well above the potential food elevation and/or inside watertight containers.\n","7436:  _ Seal your foundation and basement walls.\n","7437:  Close any foundation cracks with mortar and masonry caulk or hydraulic cement, which expands and flls gaps completely.\n","7438:  Seal walls in your basements with waterproofng compounds to avoid seepage.\n","7439:  Make sure any foor drains are clear of obstructions.\n","7440:  _ Install food vents.\n","7442:  Properly positioned and installed food vents protect homes during foods by preventing water pressure buildup that can destroy walls and foundations.\n","7443:  Flood openings may be required for lower enclosures of homes being built in high-risk food zones, but they can also be installed in existing homes.\n","7444:  Once installed, make sure your food vents are kept free of debris and will allow the free-fow of foodwater.\n","7445:  _ Install a sump pump.\n","7446:  Sump pumps, which pump groundwater away from your home, can be an excellent defense against basement seepage and fooding.\n","7447:  They draw in the groundwater from around the house and direct it away from the structure through drainage pipes.\n","7448:  Be sure to choose a device with battery-operated backup, in case of electrical power failure.\n","7449:  _ Prevent sewer backups.\n","7450:  Install drain plugs for all basement foor drains to prevent sewer backups.\n","7451:  Another recommended option, regardless of the potential food elevation, is to install sewer backfow valves for all pipes entering the building.\n","7452:  These devices, which allow water to fow only one direction, prevent foodwater and wastewater from backing up into your home through toilets, sinks, and other drains.\n","7453:  They are available in a variety of designs that range from simple to complex, but they should be installed by a qualifed, licensed plumber.\n","7454:  _ Use food-resistant building materials.\n","7455:  FLOOD PREPAREDNESS You may be able to take additional actions immediately before an expected food event that will prevent or reduce food damage to your home: _ Activate food protection devices (turn on sump pumps, close backfow valves, etc.).\n","7456:  _ Shut off electricity at the breaker panel.\n","7457:  _ Safeguard important paperwork and move furniture, rugs, electronics, and other valuable belongings to upper foors, or at least off the foor of the ground level.\n","7458:  _ Elevate major appliances onto concrete blocks.\n","7459:  _ Clean gutters, downspouts, and splash pads, along with any nearby drainage ditches or storm drains; clear snow and ice away from foundations.\n","7460:  _ Deploy temporary food barriers, such as portable food gates or shields, sandbags, infatable foodwalls, and food skirts.\n","7461:  _ Replace wooden foorboards and carpets with ceramic tile, vinyl, rubber, or other food-resistant materials.\n","7462:  Use moveable rugs instead of ftted carpets.\n","7463:  _ Replace internal walls and ceilings with food-resistant material such as lime plaster, cement board, concrete, or pressure-treated and decay-resistant wood.\n","7464:  _ Replace wooden doors and window frames with metal or other food- resistant options.\n","7465:  _ Raise electrical system components.\n","7466:  Increase the height of electric service panels (fuse and circuit breaker boxes) and all outlets, switches, and wiring to at least 1 foot above the potential food elevation.\n","7467:  These modifcations should be made by a licensed electrician.\n","7468:  _ Protect utilities and service equipment.\n","7469:  Move the main parts of your heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems to a higher foor or the attic.\n","7470:  Consider raising other major appliances, such as washers, dryers, and hot water heaters, above the ground foor.\n","7471:  If relocation or elevation is not possible, you can protect service equipment in place using low foodwalls and shields.\n","7472:  Alternative options such as replacing traditional hot water heaters with tankless units should also be considered.\n","7473:  _ Anchor indoor fuel tanks.\n","7474:  Anchor fuel tanks by attaching them to a large concrete slab that weighs enough to resist the force of foodwaters.\n","7475:  _ Install a food alert system.\n","7476:  A variety of food sensors and other early warning devices can alert you to the risk of imminent fooding so that you can take preventative or protective actions before extensive damage occurs (see _Flood Preparedness_).\n","7478:  Contact your local community offcials.\n","7479:  Start with the local planning and zoning offce or building department, and ask to speak with the designated foodplain administrator.\n","7480:  Consult local contractors or design professionals with food mitigation expertise.\n","7481:  Visit the following websites: FEMA, Protect Your Property www.fema.gov/protect-your-property FEMA Region III, Mitigation Division www.fema.gov/region-iii-mitigation

A.\n","7513:  Where possible the same terminology and definitions as used in the existing documents; Dike Design and Construction Guide 20032 and Land Use Guidelines 20044 are used; however, as the existing terminology and definitions sometimes need modification, clarification or expansion to be appropriate for coastal conditions, in some cases new or revised terminology and definitions are proposed.\n","7514:  It is recommended that the reader of the updated documents familiarize themselves with the updated terminology and definitions in Appendix A as necessary.\n","7515:  Reference Documents This Guideline document refers to several publications that are recognized as current examples of best practice for the design of coastal engineering structures, including sea dikes.\n","7516:  Where such reference is made it is intended to refer to the most current edition, as listed below, and to all amendments or updates published thereto.\n","7517:  It should be noted that a Building Code or Standard does not exist in Canada for coastal engineering structures.\n","7518:  The referenced publications and Standards listed below are intended to provide guidance on internationally accepted best practice.\n","7519:  In some cases inter-comparison of documents will reveal several approaches may apply.\n","7520:  In these situations; theoretical analysis, evaluation of the approaches for application to the specifics of British Columbia coastal waters and recognized engineering practise should be used to select among alternative methods.\n","7521:  Direct measurement of specific parameters, over appropriate intervals of time, may also be necessary or advisable.\n","7522:  Detailed site or structure specific engineering investigations may also

and assets behind the dike against the effects of flooding or inundation.\n","7541:  A sea dike is not intended to protect the shoreline or the adjacent seabed against erosion, although this may become a secondary aspect of the sea dike design, or the sea dike may be incorporated into a larger project with erosion protection, shoreline restoration or marine habitat preservation as concurrent objectives.\n","7543:  Guidance regarding these design criteria is provided in the companion document: Policy Discussion Paper 20103.\n","7544:  3.2 Design Environment 3.2.1 General This section describes the evaluation of physical environmental conditions that will be required to define the main functional or geometric aspects of a sea dike.\n","7545:  3.2.2 Location of Facility (Reference elevation _ depth of water) The water depths and terrestrial elevations at the location of a sea dike shall be determined from site-specific bathymetric and topographic surveys referenced to a common vertical and horizontal datum.\n","7546:  Where bathymetric and topographic surveys are undertaken with respect to a separate datum, the relationship between the bathymetric datum and the topographic datum shall be defined over the entire project area.\n","7547:  The relationship between the bathymetric survey datum, the topographic survey datum and the tidal datum for the area shall also be defined over the project area5.\n","7548:  3.2.3 Sea Level Rise Global Climate Change Sea Level Rise Sea Level Rise is predicted to be moderate in the period from 2010 to 2025.\n","7549:  However, the

with the exception of the Lower Mainland area and the Richmond _ Delta regions in particular, vertical land movement is positive (rising) at rates between 1 and 3 mm/yr.\n","7568:  Over a period of 100 years this will decrease the expected global SLR by 0.1 to 0.3 m, but not enough to overcome the expected effects of climate change.\n","7569:  Subsidence is expected in the Richmond-Delta region at average rates of 1 to 2 mm/yr.\n","7570:  Over a period of 100 years these rates will increase the expected sea level rise due to global SLR by 0.1 to 0.2 m. 3.2.4 Astronomical Tides Predictions of expected water levels due to astronomical tides are available throughout coastal British Columbia from the Canadian Hydrographic Service (CHS), Fisheries and Oceans Canada and are published annually under the authority of CHS.\n","7571:  Volumes 5 through 7 of the Canadian Tide and Current Tables (issued annually) provide sufficient information on astronomical tidal characteristics for planning and preliminary design throughout most of BC coastal areas, through a combination of Principal Reference Ports and numerous Secondary Ports.\n","7572:  As the tidal information at Secondary Ports is often based on limited durations of observations (typically one month or possibly less), they may not be current and as they only provide corrections for times and heights of specific tide parameters, project specific tidal measurement programs must be undertaken for all projects, at the project location, prior to detailed design.\n","7573:  Indicative tidal ranges are summarized in Table 3-1.\n","7574:  The published data in Volumes 5 through 7 of the Canadian Tide and Current Tables for specific areas within each general region should be consulted as tidal ranges can vary by 1 m or more within each region.\n","7575:  Tidal ranges within a river estuary will also vary significantly; both by location within the estuary and according to river discharge.\n","7576:  Guidelines are available in Volume 5 for the Fraser River.\n","7578:  Definition of the Designated Flood Level for the design of a sea dike will require definition of a combination of appropriate tidal water levels and meteorological related water levels.\n","7579:  Joint probability analysis methods are often used to define appropriate combinations of tide and storm surge that reflect the times of occurrence of the two processes; however, as tide is totally independent of storm occurrence and resulting storm surge, reasonable and valid estimates can be made by treating the statistics of each process as independent.\n","7580:  In this case, the combined probability is simply the product of the probability of high tide during the time period of interest and the probability of the Designated Storm.\n","7581:  Guidance for defining appropriate combinations of storm surge is provided below in Section 3.2.5.\n","7582:  Rev: 0 Date: 27 January 2011 Project No: 143111: BC Ministry of

analysis will be required.\n","7599:  Methodologies for assessing the magnitude of additional surge are outlined in the Reference Publications.\n","7600:  Examples of the magnitude of these local effects are provided in the sample cases in Appendix C. 3.2.6 Wave Climate Incident Deepwater Wave Climate Definition of appropriate sea dike crest elevations will require specification of the incident wave climate during storms that are consistent with the selected design criteria.\n","7601:  For most sea dikes, with their seaward face situated at or above normal high tide elevations, the design wave climate will generally be controlled by the depth of water a short distance seaward of the toe.\n","7602:  Specification of the appropriate location to define the design wave climate is generally unique to the design methodology being used for a specific component of the dike.\n","7603:  Reference must be made to the specific requirements in the Reference Publications.\n","7604:  Local Wave Climate at the Dike As a preliminary guideline, the maximum seastate7 that can exist in a given depth of shallow water can be estimated using the procedures outlined in CIRIA; CUR; CETMEF (2007) or US Army Corps of Engineering (2002).\n","7605:  The seastate that can exist at a sea dike depends strongly on the water depth at the toe of the sea dike, the slope of the foreshore in front of the sea dike and in some cases on the seaward slope of the sea dike itself.\n","7606:  As guidance, the maximum seastate (Hs) 7 may be between approximately 0.5 and 1.2 times the depth of water.\n","7607:  In general, an iterative procedure will be required during design to define the seastate.\n","7608:  It will also be necessary to check that the seastate at the toe of the dike is consistent with the Designated Storm for the annual exceedance probability specified for the sea dike planning or design process.\n","7609:  The details of the design seastate that are required for planning or design can be defined using the procedures outlined in EA, ENW, KFKI (2007) or specifically in Battjes, et al.\n","7610:  (2000).\n","7611:  3.2.7 Scour Waves and currents may cause scour to occur on the seabed adjacent to a sea dike.\n","7612:  The scour depth that may occur either during the design life of the sea dike or during the Designated Storm should be considered and either

Use 10 3.2.8 Freeboard It is common practice in offshore and coastal engineering codes and standards of practice to include provision for uncertainties by specifying a minimum freeboard or similar allowance.\n","7619:  Generally the freeboard accounts for the known uncertainties in technical elements of the design methodology, i.e., the appropriate wave theory for the depth of water or variations in seabed conditions along the shoreline, among others.\n","7620:  In the specific case of the sea level rise to be considered for design, the problem is compounded by uncertainties surrounding the present estimates of the future extent of climate change, the resulting sea level rise, the time frame over which a particular decision is being made and in some cases for the actions or consequences of other stakeholders or property owners that may directly affect a particular shoreline area.\n","7621:  A more detailed review of issues related to appropriate freeboard allowances is provided in the companion policy document: Policy Discussion Paper 20103.\n","7622:  As a minimum, it is recommended that the present freeboard allowance of 0.6 m should be included in sea dike design, above and beyond any specific allowances adopted to deal with the known uncertainties for the area in question.\n","7623:  These known uncertainties should be explicitly stated during

4.1.1 Crest Elevation General The crest elevation of a sea dike shall be established to provide the protection required during the Designated Storm.\n","7625:  The Sea Dike Crest Elevation can be defined based on the following: Designated Flood Level + Wave Run-up + Freeboard or: Designated Flood Level + Acceptable Crest Height where: Wave Run-up = vertical distance above the mean water level exceeded, by no more than 2% of the waves at the toe of the sea dike Acceptable Crest Height = vertical distance above the mean water level required to keep any wave overtopping below the chosen criteria for acceptable rates of overtopping, as summarized below in Table 4-1 or Table 4-2.\n","7626:  Alternatively an Acceptable Crest Height can be defined based on the results of a Quantitative Risk Analysis (QRA) process that identifies an acceptable amount of inundation during the Designated Storm.\n","7627:  In general, a Sea Dike Crest Elevation is established so that any overtopping that occurs during the Designated Storm is within limits set to ensure that inundation behind the dike during the storm is acceptable, that it is within the limits considered during the design of the dike armour components, on the seaward and landward faces, and on the sea dike crest, and that it is consistent with any requirement for personnel to be present on the dike during the Designated Storm Event.\n","7628:  The total quantity of overtopping during the Designated Storm should be defined to ensure that it is consistent with the FCL defined for inundation behind a Sea Dike.\n","7629:  Overtopping of a sea dike can take two main forms.\n","7630:  If wave runup is high enough, relative to the crest elevation of the dike, water can pass over the dike as a nearly continuous sheet or plume of water.\n","7631:  In the second case, as waves break against the seaward face, a mixture of air and water droplets _ spray _ can be carried over the dike, either by the momentum of the breaking wave or by the added effect of entrainment into the onshore winds.\n","7632:  Over time, if left undrained, the volume of water contained in the spray can accumulate and result in flooding (inundation) behind the dike.\n","7633:  In general, it is usually uneconomic to design a sea dike with a crest elevation high enough to prevent all overtopping.\n","7634:  In many cases, other factors, including available land, existing land uses, soil conditions, access, visibility over the dike or habitat issues may limit the sea dike crest elevation.\n","7635:  Guidance on acceptable limits for overtopping is available in the Reference Publications.\n","7636:  As initial guidance, the average or mean overtopping discharges summarized below in Table 4-1 and Table 4-2 can be used.\n","7638:  The criteria in Table 4-2 can be used to estimate the crest elevation required for a vertical seawall that starts at or near the high tide elevation.\n","7639:  Rev: 0 Date: 27 January 2011 Project No: 143111: BC Ministry of Environment /Climate Change Adaption Guidelines for Sea Dikes and Coastal Flood Hazard Land Use 12 It should be noted that these criteria do not cover all possible configurations of sea dikes, or all issues that may be pertinent, and detailed engineering investigations may be required in specific cases.\n","7640:  Table 4-1: Available Criteria for

The criteria in Table 4-1 were partially validated in 2007 by tests using an overtopping simulator on a real sea dike in the Netherlands.\n","7645:  The dike had an landward slope of 1:3 (V:H) and was constructed of clay (less than 30 per cent sand) with a thick grass sod cover.\n","7646:  The sea dike successfully withstood a series of simulated 6 hour storms, up to a mean overtopping rate of 50 liters/s/m.\n","7647:  After the first test, the grass sod was removed and the sequence of simulated storms was repeated.\n","7648:  It was found that erosion damage started on the _unprotected_ dike at an overtopping rate of 0.1 liters/s/m.\n","7649:  After 6 hours of overtopping at a mean rate of 10 liters/s/m, the sea dike was considered _not too far from initial breaching_.\n","7650:  Rev: 0 Date: 27 January 2011 Project No: 143111: BC Ministry of Environment /Climate Change Adaption Guidelines for Sea Dikes and Coastal Flood Hazard Land Use 13 Similar testing has also found that if knowledgeable people (for instance; maintenance or inspection crews) or vehicles (for inspection during storms) are present on the dike, then safety considerations may limit acceptable rates of overtopping to between 1 and 50 liters/s/m8.\n","7651:  Along a dike of approximately 1000 m length, a limit of 10 liters/s/m implies that during a six hour storm the total volume of water overtopping the sea dike could amount to: 10 liters/s/m x 1000 m x 6 h x 3600 sec/hr = 216 million liters = 216,000 m3 This volume of water will amount to approximately 2 m of standing water over a land area of 10 hectares, unless it can be drained away.\n","7652:  In the case of the criteria in Table 4-2, it must be noted that reliable guidance does not exist to define the effect of distance on the decay rate of overtopping and therefore it may not be clear how far behind a given dike or seawall a building must be to satisfy the 1 liter/m/s threshold.\n","7653:  Site specific engineering investigations are warranted in many situations.\n","7654:  Specification of a suitable Sea Dike Crest Elevation will generally be an iterative process as the volume of overtopping for a given Designated Storm will be significantly influenced by the design of the seaward face of the sea dike.\n","7655:  Acceptable quantities of overtopping may also be significantly influenced by the design of the landward face of the sea dike, especially if space or land use does not permit the 1:3 (V:H) landward slope implied by the criteria in Table 4-1.\n","7656:  Case specific engineering investigations will be warranted in many situations.\n","7657:  Examples of the application of the threshold conditions in Table 4-1 and Table 4-2 are provided in Appendix C. 4.1.2 Seaward Face Design

guidance for the landward face of a sea dike that is exposed to overtopping is, in general, limited in scope.\n","7663:  Structure specific detailed engineering investigations will likely be required if the design is different from the 1:3 (V:H) landward slope implied by the criteria in Table 4-1 and Table 4-2.\n","7664:  8 These limits represent the extreme range that might be

may occur in any given year, of such a magnitude as to equal a flood having a 200-year recurrence interval based on a frequency analysis of unregulated historic flood records or by regional analysis where there is inadequate streamflow data available.\n","7705:  Where the flow of a large watercourse is controlled by a major dam, the designated flood shall be set on a site-specific basis.\n","7706:  In coastal areas, the existing definition of a Designated Flood is not appropriate as the probability of flooding from the sea is the result of the joint occurrence of tide and a storm crossing the coastal waters of British Columbia and at some time in the future, sea level rise due to climate change.\n","7707:  In estuaries, where a river discharges into the sea, the definition of the Designated Flood applies to the river.\n","7708:  In these documents the definition _Designated Flood_ is replaced with the term _Designated Storm_ as defined below.\n","7709:  1.4 Designated Flood Level (DFL) The observed or calculated elevation for the Designated Flood and is used in the calculation of the Flood Construction Level.\n","7710:  In coastal areas, the Designated Flood Level (DFL) includes the appropriate allowance for future sea level rise, tide and the total storm surge expected during the designated storm.\n","7711:  1.5 Designated Storm (DS) A storm, which may occur in any given year, of such a magnitude as to equal a storm having the designated annual exceedence probability (AEP).\n","7712:  The Designated Storm has several phenomena associated with it that will define components of the Designated Flood Level, including storm surge, wind set-up, wave run-up and overtopping for the storm.\n","7714:  1.6 Diking Authority (a) The commissioners of a district to which Part 2 of the Drainage, Ditch and Dike Act applies, (b) A person owning or controlling a dike other than a private dike, (b1) If the final agreement of a treaty first nation so provides, the treaty first nation in relation to dikes on its treaty lands, Appendix A 2 (c) A public authority designated by the minister as having any responsibility for maintenance of a dike other than a private dike, or (d) A regional district, a municipality or an improvement district.\n","7715:  1.7 Flood Construction Level (FCL) Uses the Designated Flood Level plus an allowance for Freeboard to establish the elevation of the underside of a wooden floor system or top of concrete slab for habitable buildings.\n","7716:  In the case of a manufactured home, the ground level or top of concrete or asphalt pad, on which it is located, shall be equal to or higher than the above described elevation.\n","7717:  It also establishes the minimum crest level of a Standard Dike.\n","7718:  Where the Designated Flood Level cannot be determined or where there are overriding factors, an assessed height above the natural boundary of the water-body or above the natural ground elevation may be used (as defined in the Land Use Guidelines 2004).\n","7719:  In coastal areas the FCL does not relate to the crest level of a sea dike, nor does it relate to the crest level of flood proofing fill exposed directly to the designated flood level.\n","7720:  The FCL does; however, include wave _ structure interaction effects, to be determined at the location of the site of the building.\n","7721:  1.8 Flood Construction Reference Plane (FCRP) The vertical elevation of an estimated future Natural Boundary from which the FCL is determined.\n","7722:  1.9 Flood Plain A lowland area, whether diked, flood proofed, or not, which, by reasons of land elevation, is susceptible to flooding from an adjoining watercourse, ocean, lake or other body of water and for administration purposes is taken to be that area submerged at the Designated Flood Level.\n","7723:  In coastal areas the concept of the Flood Plain has been extended to a _Sea Level Rise Planning Area_; defined below.\n","7724:  Special measures may be warranted in this area.\n","7725:  1.10 Flood Proofing The alteration of land or structures either physically or in use to reduce flood damage and includes the use of building setbacks from water bodies to maintain a floodway and allow for potential erosion.\n","7726:  Flood Proofing may be achieved by all or a combination of the following: _ Building on fill, provided such fill does not interfere with flood flows of the watercourse, and is adequately protected against floodwater erosion _ Building raised by structural means such as foundation walls, columns, etc.\n","7727:  _ A combination of fill and structural means.\n","7728:  In coastal areas exposed to flooding, construction of fill as a flood proofing measure may substantially increase the freeboard required to define the FCL, if the fill is directly exposed to the Designated Flood Level.\n","7729:  In this case, the FCL must be equivalent to the crest level of a sea dike with the same characteristics as the seaward face of the fill.. 1.11 Freeboard A vertical distance added to the Designated Flood Level.\n","7730:  Used to establish the Flood Construction Level.\n","7731:  Appendix A 3 In coastal areas, the vertical distance to be added to a Designated Flood Level is site and structure specific.\n","7732:  1.12 Natural Boundary Means the visible high watermark of any lake, river, stream or other body of water where the presence and action of the water are so common and usual and so long continued in all ordinary years as to mark upon the soil of the bed of the lake, river, stream or other body of water a character distinct from that of the banks thereof, in respect to vegetation, as well as in respect to the nature of the soil itself (Land Act, Section 1).\n","7733:  In addition, the natural boundary includes the best estimate of the edge of dormant or old side channels and marsh areas.\n","7734:  For coastal areas, the natural boundary shall include the natural limit of permanent terrestrial vegetation.\n","7735:  Natural Boundary is an established concept in BC law _ and reflects a change in vegetation and soil based on effects of the sea.\n","7736:  In the Flood Hazard Area Land Use Guidelines 2004, building setbacks were established from Natural Boundary, on the unstated assumption that the location of Natural Boundary is relatively static (other than erosions and accretions).\n","7737:  Natural boundary is, in practice, often difficult to determine in the field or from remote survey.\n","7738:  In coastal areas, the Natural Boundary reflects a snapshot historical record of tide, storm surge and wave runup effects, which may be the mark of a recent storm in an ordinary year or it may be the mark of the most severe storm in recent times.\n","7739:  There is no way of knowing for certain.\n","7740:  A technical basis for the Natural Boundary in coastal areas is site and time specific.\n","7741:  In the future the location and elevation of a Natural Boundary will change from time to time due to changes associated with sea level rise and it will likely lag sea level rise.\n","7742:  It is also unlikely to immediately reflect the action of the water, especially the storm surge and waves, during a Designated Storm.\n","7743:  1.13 Project Life The number of years a particular project; including a sea dike, a building or a community, is intended to serve before it is replaced, upgraded or dismantled.\n","7744:  Regular maintenance to ensure the project provides the intended purpose is expected during the project life.\n","7745:  1.14 Sea Dike A dike, floodwall or any other thing that prevents flooding of land by the sea.\n","7746:  As defined in the Dike Maintenance Act, _dike_ means _an embankment, wall, fill, piling, pump, gate, flood box, pipe, sluice, culvert, canal, ditch, drain_.\n","7747:  1.15 Sea Dike Crest Elevation Sea Dike Crest Elevation has essentially the same meaning as _dike crest height_ in the existing document _Dike Design and Construction Guide 2003_.\n","7748:  However, the existing definition of dike height suggests that consideration of wave run-up and set-up is optional.\n","7749:  The term Sea Dike Crest Elevation is defined to specifically cover scenarios where wave run- up, overtopping and wind and wave setup must be included in defining the height of the dike.\n","7750:  1.16 Sea Dike System A system of: dikes, dunes, berms or natural shorelines that provide a similar function; and associated engineering works (e.g., tidal gates, outfalls, outlet structures, seawalls, quay walls, ramps, adjacent building features, etc.)\n","7751:  used to protect land from flooding or inundation.\n","7752:  In the Netherlands where dike systems are highly evolved, a dike system is termed a _dike ring_ that forms the flooding defence for a region.\n","7754:  In BC, multiple Diking Authorities may share responsibility for the same sea dike system.\n","7755:  1.17 Sea Level Rise (SLR) An allowance for increases in the mean elevation of the ocean associated with future climate change, including any regional effects such as crustal subsidence or uplift.\n","7756:  1.18 Sea Level Rise Planning Area (SLR Planning Area) An area of land that may be subject to future flooding due to Sea Level Rise.\n","7757:  This area defines a future coastal flood plain.\n","7758:  The SLR Planning Area extends from the existing Natural Boundary landward to the highest predicted point of potential flooding related to SLR plus flooding expected from the combination of high tide, total storm surge and expected wave runup during the Designated Storm.\n","7759:  Predictions of SLR for the SLR Planning Area definition shall use best predictions for minimum periods of 90-100 years and 200 years forward.\n","7760:  From time to time, both the Natural Boundary and the predictions for SLR are subject to change, and therefore the extent of a SLR Planning Area may be revised at regular intervals in the future.\n","7761:  1.19 Seastate The term _seastate_ is used to encapsulate, in a general way, all of the parameters and characteristics that may be needed during design to define the waves at a given instant in time.\n","7762:  The sea state is the general condition of the free surface of a body of water_with respect to wind waves and swell_at a certain location and moment.\n","7763:  The sea state is characterized by statistics, including wave height(s), period(s), distribution and power spectrum.\n","7764:  The sea state varies with time, as the weather or oceanographic factors change.\n","7765:  For engineering purposes the seastate is often characterized by the significant wave height, Hs.\n","7766:  1.20 Setback Means withdrawal or siting of a building or landfill away from the natural boundary or other reference line to maintain a floodway and to allow for potential land erosion.\n","7767:  1.21 Standard Dikes Dikes built to a minimum crest elevation equal to the Flood Construction Level and meeting standards of design and construction approved by the Ministry of Environment and maintained by an ongoing authority such as a local government body.\n","7768:  1.22 Storm Surge A change in water level caused by the action of wind and atmospheric pressure variation on the sea surface.\n","7769:  The typical effect is to raise the level of the sea above the predicted astronomical tide level, although in some situations, such as when winds blow offshore, the actual water level may be lower than that predicted.\n","7770:  The magnitude of a storm surge on the BC coast will be dependent on the severity and duration of the storm event in the North Pacific, its track relative to the BC coast and the seabed bathymetry at the site.\n","7771:  1.23 Total Storm Surge The combination of the storm surge generated in deep water plus the additional local surge or wind setup generated by the effect of the winds during the Designated Storm over shallow Appendix A 5 water at a particular site.\n","7772:  In general the deep water storm surge is nearly the same as that recorded at a tidal gauging station.\n","7773:  Additional surge may occur at other sites.\n","7774:  For planning purpose, winds during a Designated Storm will start to generate local surge in water depths less than 30 m. 1.24 Wave Run-up The vertical distance that waves run-up the seaward slope of a structure or a shoreline.\n","7775:  The vertical distance is measured from the mean water level, which is the same as the Designated Flood Level.\n","7776:  For coastal flooding hazard management the Wave Run-up is taken as 50 per cent of the calculated run-up elevation on the natural shoreline.\n","7777:  This ratio is based on analysis completed for this assignment (2010) and may be revised as more information becomes available.\n","7778:  For defining a Sea Dike Crest Elevation the Wave Run-up is taken to be the vertical distance exceeded by no more than 2% of the waves during the Designated Storm at the toe of the sea dike 1.25 Wave Set-up An increase in mean water surface close to the shoreline caused by wave action; important during storm events as it results in a further increase in water level above the tide and surge levels, landward of the location where waves start to break.\n","7779:  Wave set-up will lead to larger waves existing at the seaward toe of a sea dike than might otherwise be expected.\n","7780:  1.26 Wave Overtopping The passage of water over the top of a sea dike as a result of wave runup or related surge and setup.\n","7781:  Water overtopping a sea dike may pass over the dike as a flow of water or as spray and the specific characteristics are site and structure specific.\n","7782:  1.27 Wind Set-up A rise of the water surface above the water level on the open coast due to the local action of wind stress on the water surface.\n","7783:  2 Acronyms and Symbols 2.1 CD Tide and chart datum _ in Canadian waters the plane below which the tide will seldom fall.\n","7784:  Tide datum and chart datum is usually the same provided the chart is the largest scale available chart for area.\n","7785:  For a site specific survey tide and chart (sounding) datum may be different and the specifics should be stated explicitly.\n","7786:  2.2 CGD Canadian Geodetic Datum.\n","7787:  In 2010 the vertical reference plane in Canada is in the process of being changed from a MSL related datum plane _ technically known as CGVD28 _ to a geoid at http://www.geod.nrcan.gc.ca/hm/index_e.php.\n","7788:  The term CGD is taken to mean the datum as defined in 2010 and approximately equal to MSL.\n","7789:  described program plan.\n","7790:  based

however a brief discussion is provided as background to the definition of storm surge used in this document.\n","7871:  In particular, the connection between the offshore character of the storms and the resulting storm surge is discussed.\n","7872:  As an example, the storm of 12 March _ 15 March, 2010 is shown below.\n","7873:  This storm entered the Gulf of Alaska near the southern tip of the Aleutian Islands on 12 March 2010, moving in a generally easterly direction along the 50th parallel of latitude, Figure 2-1.\n","7874:  The evolution of the storm over the period up to 15 March 2010 is shown in Figure 2-2, by which time hurricane force winds were expected in the Hecate Strait area of coastal British Columbia.\n","7875:  This storm generated gale to storm force winds throughout much of the Gulf of Alaska.\n","7876:  The surface effect of the storm winds on 12 March can be seen in Figure 2-3, where the red shading centred approximately on the 53rd parallel of latitude corresponds to a surge, above tide, of approximately 0.6 m. This large area of surge is being setup by the combination of the inverse barometer affect due to the low atmospheric pressure and to the effect of the gale to storm force winds circulating around the low pressure centre.\n","7877:  In this particular case, the storm crossed the North American coastline north of Dixon Entrance and the surge mainly affected Alaska state coastal waters.\n","7878:  A track south of the 50th parallel would have brought the deepwater surge directly onto the British Columbia coast.\n","7879:  The length of coastline affected by the storm surge for a storm of this severity is clearly as long or even longer than the west coast of British Columbia.\n","7880:  Appendix D 1 Figure 2-1: Mid-Latitude Extra-Tropical Storm of Mid-March 2010 Note: central pressure = 966 mb Appendix D 2 Figure 2-2: Evolution of Storm 12 March _ 15 March 2010 source: BC Storm Surge Model - http://www.pac.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/sci/juandefuca/npac_lr Figure 2-3: Storm Driven Surge in Gulf Alaska 2.2 Expected Coastal Deepwater Storm Surges for BC Examination of the surges recorded along the BC coastline has shown that in many, if not in most cases, the deepwater surge generated in the North Pacific, after modification over the continental shelf, arrives relatively unchanged at all stations in the general north coast or south coast areas of British Columbia.\n","7881:  An example of the storm surges recorded on the coast for a storm on 9 _ 16 December 1995, is shown in Figure 2-4 and illustrates how the surge wave retains its main characteristics all the way from its arrival on the west coast of Appendix D 3 Vancouver Island (as recorded at Tofino), its passage up Juan de Fuca Strait (as recorded at Victoria and then into the Strait of Georgia (as recorded at Point Atkinson).\n","7882:  The peak of the surge, at approximately 22:00 hr on 12 December at Point Atkinson, occurred 5 hours earlier at Tofino and only increased in magnitude by approximately 0.1 m. The peak of the surge, which is at least 6 hours long (within a 0.1 m tolerance), coincided with a peak in the gale force SE winds that characterised this particular storm.\n","7883:  As part of this assignment, the self-similar characteristics of the incident surge wave from the North Pacific were examined for multiple storms and the trend exhibited in Figure 2-4 is typical.\n","7884:  On the basis of these trends the expected magnitudes for the incident deepwater storm surge were grouped and characterized as described in this report.\n","7885:  Victoria res WL Tofino res WL Pt Atkinson

Fraser River Delta.\n","7886:  Methods for estimating the additional effects are provided in the Reference Publications.\n","7887:  Appendix D 4 2.4 Joint Occurrence of Storm Surge and Tide An important element in the design of a sea dike is establishing the appropriate stage of astronomical tide, for combination with a storm surge, to be used for setting the total water level, and associated wind and wave related effects, for the Designated Flood Level.\n","7888:  This topic is an area of ongoing research and development and warrants additional investigations of its own.\n","7889:  For the purpose of this document, which maintains the existing guidance in the Dike Design and Construction Guide 2003, that combines the maximum high tide with the appropriate storm surge, the problem becomes one of assigning an AEP to the selection of the storm surge (and the Designated Storm) that is consistent with the total water level or Designated Flood Level.\n","7890:  The problem can be addressed by considering storms and the associated effects, including storm surge, winds and waves, as processes that are totally independent of the astronomical tides.\n","7891:  The combined probability, or alternatively, the AEP of the combined effects, becomes simply the product of the probability of the storm and the probability of there being a high tide present on the coast at the same time.\n","7892:  The simultaneous values of residual water levels and the associated astronomical tides recorded at Tofino are shown in Figure 2-5.\n","7893:  This data, which covers approximately 66 winter storm periods during the total record shows that the combination of both a high tide (4.1 m) and a high storm surge (residual water level) is quite rare.\n","7894:  Figure 2-5: Simultaneous Residual Water Levels and Predicted Tide _ Tofino Note: MWL = 2.1 m (predicted tide) In simple terms, the probability of having a high tide during the winter storm season, which typically spans 3 to 4 months (mid-October to mid-January), is related to the number of days in this period when a high tide is expected _ spring tides typically exist for approximately 3 Appendix D 5 days every 2 weeks and during those three days only exist for 2 to 3 hours (within a range of approximately _ 0.1 m) on each of the three days.\n","7895:  The probability of a high tide window is then approximately: 3 days x 2 hours/window 14 days x 24 hours/day 3 days x 3 hours/window 14 days x 24 hours/day or between 1/56 to 1/37 to As the duration of the peak of a storm surge is typically approximately 6 hours long (within a range of _ 0.1 m), or approximately twice the duration of the high tide then the probability of having the peak of a storm surge at high tide becomes 2/56 to 2/37 or 1/26 to 1/18.5.\n","7896:  For the purpose of this report we have taken the probability of a high tide window during the occurrence of a storm to be approximately 1/20.\n","7897:  On this basis the total AEP for high tide and a typical winter storm (the annual average expected storm) becomes 1/20 x _ _ 1/40.\n","7898:  By the same reasoning the estimated AEP for the total water level during the largest storm surge of record shown in Figure 2-5, occurring at MWL becomes approximately 1 x 1/300 _ 1/300.\n","7899:  The AEP for high tide and a storm with an AEP of 1/200 years (the current guidance AEP) becomes 1/20 x 1/200 _ 1/4000.\n","7900:  The AEP for a storm that will yield a Designated Flood Level with an AEP of 1/10000 years becomes 1/500, which is not significantly greater in actual effect than the current guidance in British Columbia.\n","7901:  2.5 Joint Occurrence of Storm Surge and Waves The selection of a sea dike crest elevation that satisfies the chosen design criteria requires the identification of the wave climate that is expected to occur during the Designated Storm.\n","7902:  Preliminary examination of the joint occurrence of recorded waves and residual water levels (storm surge) from two areas in coastal British Columbia waters suggests that the largest waves are not necessarily associated with the largest storm surges, Figure 2-6 and Figure 2-7.\n","7903:  For the purpose of this assignment it has been assumed for the sea dike examples, that the wave climate present at the sea dike is controlled by the depth of water at the sea dike and that the wave climate in deep water is sufficient to sustain the depth limited conditions.\n","7904:  Further investigations are warranted for all areas of coastal British Columbia and will be required during more detailed engineering for sea dikes.\n","7905:  Appendix D 6 Figure 2-6: Simultaneous Residual Water Levels and Significant Wave Height Residual Water Level from Tofino _ Waves

here, increasing global loss of life and property damage as weather patterns change.\n","7935:  We now know that with climate change comes rising seas _ and that this sea level rise will dramatically affect Canada_s southern coastal communities.1 These communities will require resilience and adaptive capacity to ensure their long-term sustainability.\n","7937:  This Primer provides an introduction to past and future sea levels, an overview of four different adaptation strategies, a recommended framework for decision making and finally a total of 21 adaptation tools to support local adaptation action.\n","7938:  Ministry of the Environment commissioned the preparation of this Sea Level Rise Adaptation Primer for Canada_s Atlantic and Pacific coasts.\n","7939:  Although this Primer was prepared in B.C., legislative provisions, policies and local government applications discussed in this Primer include B.C., southern Quebec and the Atlantic coasts of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland and Labrador.\n","7941:  Adaptation strategies to sea level rise can be grouped as follows: Protect Accommodate Retreat Avoid Protect is a reactive strategy to protect people, property and infrastructure from sea level rise and is typically the first response considered.\n","7942:  Protecting the coastline through structural mechanisms such as dikes, seawalls and groynes has been the traditional approach to dealing with sea level rise in many parts of the world.\n","7943:  With increasing sea level rise and coastal vulnerability, this strategy may be prohibitively expensive and have limited long-term effectiveness in highly vulnerable locations.\n","7944:  Accommodate is an adaptive strategy that allows continued occupation of coastal areas while changes are made to human activities and/or infrastructure to adapt to sea level rise.\n","7945:  Accommodation can also involve retrofitting a building or making it more resilient to the consequences of sea level rise.\n","7946:  Other accommodation measures may include liability reduction, such as a covenant indemnifying governments from the consequences of coastal hazards regardless of protection works undertaken.\n","7947:  1 (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2007).\n","7948:  3 Retreat or Managed Retreat refers to any strategic decision to withdraw, relocate or abandon private or public assets at risk due to sea level rise and associated coastal hazards.\n","7949:  Retreat is an adaptive strategy to limit the use of structural protection, discourage development in areas subject to sea level rise, and plan for the eventual relocation of buildings and infrastructure to areas with no risk or lesser risk.\n","7950:  Avoid involves ensuring new development does not take place in areas subject to coastal hazards associated with sea level rise or where the risk is low at present but will increase over time.\n","7951:  This may involve identifying future _no build_ areas within local government planning documents.\n","7952:  A wide range of planning tools may be involved, leading to a decision to avoid development in areas subject to moderate to high risk.\n","7953:  An avoid strategy may involve land acquisition or the transfer of development potential to areas of lower risk.\n","7955:  Two or more strategies may be applied in different geographic areas by the same local government.\n","7956:  The most appropriate strategy for a geographic area may also change over time.\n","7957:  To implement these strategies, a wide range of adaptation tools are available.\n","7958:  Adaptation tools included in this Primer should be considered in the context of information gathering, public education and community engagement, all crucial to informed decision-making processes within our democratic system.\n","7961:  These regulatory tools are generally prescribed by legislation and require the approval of a decision- maker or _gatekeeper_ responsible for the protection of the public interest.\n","7962:  Land use change or restriction tools focus on the change or restriction of land use other than through the regulatory functions noted above.\n","7963:  Some of these tools are at the disposal of local government and others may be undertaken by private landowners or community groups in order to achieve local government goals.\n","7964:  Structural tools consist of physical structures on land or in water to protect land and buildings from coastal hazards.\n","7965:  A wide range of hard protection and armouring fit in this category.\n","7967:  Both sand dunes and beaches are naturally occurring features, created by the interaction of wind, waves and sediment.\n","7969:  These natural features can be mimicked or recreated to provide an adaptive buffer to sea level rise.\n","7971:  While structural and non- structural adaptation tools may appear to represent polar opposites, combining them and creating hybrid shoreline protection systems may result in synergies and cumulative benefits.\n","7973:  An analysis of each adaptation tool is provided in this Primer.\n","7974:  The analysis

of the recognized impacts of climate change _ and potentially the most dramatic for the many coastal communities of Canada _ is sea level rise (SLR).2 As oceans warm, they expand, raising global sea levels.\n","7998:  Melting ice caps, mountain glaciers, and land based ice sheets (e.g.\n","7999:  Antarctica and Greenland) also contribute to rising sea levels.\n","8000:  In several areas on Canada_s coast, geophysical factors, including subsidence and tectonic forces, also play a role.\n","8002:  Climate change also brings the prospect of more frequent and intense storms and floods _ particularly if storms occur during high tides.3 Observed Changes in Sea Level In the latter part of the 19th century and during the 20th century, the global mean sea level rose at a rate of about 1.7 mm/year (17 cm/century).4 Since 1993, the rate of global sea level rise has increased to around 3 mm/year.\n","8003:  Figure 1 - Global Trends in Mean Sea Level (IPCC, 2007) The red curve shows reconstructed sea levels from 1870 to 1950.\n","8004:  The blue curve shows coastal tide gauge measurements from 1950, and the black curve is based on satellite altimetry.\n","8006:  Storm Surge and Wave Action 2 3 4 (Ausenco Sandwell 2011) (National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy 2011) (IPCC Fourth Assessment Report: Climate Change 2007) 7 Storm surge is one of the more common coastal hazards associated with sea level rise and a significant contributor to coastal flooding.\n","8007:  A storm surge refers to a temporary increase in the height of the sea due to extreme meteorological conditions such as low atmospheric pressure and/or strong winds.\n","8008:  A storm surge is independent of a high tide, but its impact may be magnified during a high tide.\n","8009:  In addition, sea level rise accentuates the risks from storm surge activity as higher water levels advance further inland and affect areas of higher elevation.\n","8010:  It is anticipated that climate change will cause more intense and frequent storms in the northern hemisphere and that sea level rise will increase the coastal areas at risk from these events.5 While a storm surge temporarily raises relative sea level, wave action is a more destructive force associated with storms.\n","8011:  Shoreline type and exposure to open water will determine wave intensity and frequency and therefore the effects of increased wave action and height on erosion and flooding.\n","8012:  In addition to relative sea level, waves are affected by bathymetry of the near shore (i.e.\n","8013:  off-shore depth and topography).\n","8014:  Increases in sea level may cause wave impacts to reach further inland or overtop defences that were previously sufficient, causing damage and flooding.\n","8016:  From 1961-2003, melting glaciers and ice caps contributed the most to the increase in sea level rise.\n","8017:  From 1993 to 2003, the increased global rate was due mainly to thermal expansion.\n","8018:  On the B.C.\n","8019:  coast, sea level rise has occurred in most locations but at a lower rate than the global average of 17 cm/century.\n","8021:  coast, with structural uplift occurring on the west coast of Vancouver Island and subduction occurring in the Strait of Georgia.\n","8023:  Historic sea level rise changes along the B.C.\n","8025:  This trend is exemplified at the Fortress of Louisburg National Historic Site (Cape Breton, N.S.)\n","8026:  where a 1740s ship_s mooring ring is located half a metre below today_s high tide level (see following photo).\n","8027:  18th century mooring ring at Fortress of Louisbourg (Photo: Ambrose MacNeil) Stanton, Davis and Fencl 2010) 5 6 Marine Environmental Data Service, Fisheries and Oceans Canada 8 In much of Atlantic Canada, sea level rise has exceeded the global increase due to the additional effect of regional subsidence of the Earth_s crust.\n","8028:  This subsidence is caused by the gradual collapse and migration of an area of uplift that developed around the margins of the North American ice sheets and by additional water loading on the seabed of the Gulf of St. Lawrence as global mean sea levels have risen.\n","8029:  This phenomenon is referred to as _glacial isostatic adjustment._7 In Nova Scotia, subsidence is estimated to be up to 20 cm/century.8 In Halifax, approximately half of the relative sea level rise is due to global mean sea level rise, with the remaining half due to regional subsidence.\n","8030:  On the other hand, the north shore of the Gulf of St. Lawrence in Quebec and Labrador is rebounding.\n","8031:  Based on long-term harbour records, the following sea level rise trends have been documented: _ Halifax, Nova Scotia _ Yarmouth, Nova Scotia _ North Sydney, Nova Scotia _ Pictou, Nova Scotia _ Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island _ Saint John, New Brunswick Projected Increases in Sea Level How will sea level change in the future?\n","8032:  32 cm/century (records from 1920-2008) 30 cm/century (records from 1967-2008) 30 cm/century (records from 1970-2008) 24 cm/century (records from 1966-1995) 32 cm/century (records from 1911-2008) 22 cm/century (records from 1906-2008) How much sea level rise will occur is subject to uncertainty _ and the longer the time frame, the greater the degree of uncertainty.\n","8033:  In its Fourth Assessment Report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projected global sea level rise using six different scenarios of future greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.\n","8034:  Variables used to determine GHG emissions included population projections, economic growth and the use of technology.\n","8035:  Depending on the IPCC scenario used, the estimated rise in global sea level to the end of this century (i.e.\n","8036:  2100) varies from 18 to 59 cm.\n","8037:  Based on the large body of research which has taken place since the IPCC scenarios were prepared in 2007, these projections may be quite conservative.\n","8038:  Recent scientific research based on empirical relationships between atmospheric carbon concentrations and sea levels in the paleoclimatological record suggests that the upper bounds of physically plausible sea level rise is larger than once thought, owing to thermal expansion and glacial and ice sheet melt.\n","8039:  These _semi-empirical_ studies generally project a sea level rise of between 0.47 m and 1.9 m by the year 2100.9 Both B.C.\n","8040:  and Atlantic Canada recommend planning for sea level rise of approximately 1.0 m by the year 2100.\n","8041:  A 2011 study for the Government of B.C.\n","8042:  recommended sea level rise planning levels of 0.5 metres (50 cm) to the year 2050, 1.0 metre to the year 2100 and 2.0 metres to the year 2200.10 This is higher than the 2007 IPCC scenarios but is consistent with sea level rise projections used for planning purposes in Europe and the U.S.A.\n","8044:  For example, the first local government to be incorporated in B.C.\n","8045:  was New Westminster in 1859 and the oldest continuously occupied building in the province is less than 170 years old.\n","8046:  7 8 9 10 11 (CBCL

often used when designing infrastructure and planning communities.\n","8047:  Planning for a century of change is a challenge, but is a realistic goal given the implications of projected sea level rise.\n","8048:  Figure 2 (below) shows the effect of incremental increases in minimum building elevation planning over time, based on a 100 year lifespan for a structure.\n","8049:  Figure 2 - Sea

and predictions of sea level rise will need to be periodically re-evaluated.\n","8050:  Predictions of sea level rise will continue to evolve and be refined as the science progresses and more data becomes available.\n","8051:  Vulnerability and Adaptation The impact of sea level rise on Canada_s coastal zones depends largely on the vulnerability of coastal communities.\n","8052:  A community_s vulnerability is a function of its exposure and sensitivity to a hazard or environmental change and its adaptive capacity or resilience.\n","8053:  Adaptive capacity is a function of local context and refers to a community_s ability to adapt to potential impacts, as well as cope with specific events, based on its social, economic and institutional resources.12 Vulnerability can therefore be lowered by adaptation measures which reduce exposure to (or risk from) a hazard or by increasing resilience.13 Some of Canada_s greatest vulnerabilities to climate change lie in coastal areas, which are home to concentrated populations, economic centres and valuable ecosystems.14 Although Canada has a vast coastline, the inhabited coastal area represents only 2.6% of the total land area.\n","8054:  In 2001, 38.3% of the Canadian population lived within 20 kilometres (km) of a marine or Great Lakes shoreline.\n","8055:  Of this total, approximately 4.9 million people, or 23%, lived on the Pacific coast, and 20% lived on the Atlantic coast.15 By 2015, it is estimated that a majority of Canadians (50.7%) will be living within 20 km of the coast or the Great Lakes, with the greatest concentration of people living within 5 km of a shoreline.16 A proactive approach to sea level rise adaptation is more cost effective and less disruptive than a reactive approach.\n","8056:  Adaptation should ideally aim to create resilient communities through a triple bottom line approach that (1) minimizes the unplanned loss of land and physical capital such as infrastructure; 12 13 14 15 16 (Barron, et al.\n","8057:  2012) (Mason 2005) (Stanton, Davis and Fencl 2010) (Mason 2005) (Mason 2005) 10 (2) reduces coastal flood risks to acceptable levels in human settlements; and (3) retreats in a planned and efficient way from areas that cannot be protected in a cost-effective manner.17 Adaptation is more than the simple implementation of a suitable practice or technology.\n","8058:  Sea level rise is a progressive and dynamic process and continuous adaptation is required.\n","8059:  Adaptation should be viewed by community decision makers as an ongoing process whereby risks and opportunities are prioritized, risk reduction measures are implemented and their effectiveness is tracked and assessed.\n","8060:  Figure 3 - Coastal sensitivity to sea level rise _ Natural Resources Canada Arctic

region of high sensitivity to sea level rise is in Atlantic Canada and includes large parts of the coasts of Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick.30 In the Atlantic region, unlike other parts of Canada, the predicted effects of climate change, such as sea level rise and the increased occurrence and intensity of extreme weather events, are compounded in many coastal areas by post-glacial crustal subsidence.\n","8110:  This increases coastal erosion and flooding, placing dikelands, coastal populations and their infrastructure and industries at risk.31 All four provinces

sandstone bluffs and extensive sandy beaches.\n","8143:  The north shore of the Island, facing the Gulf of St Lawrence, features extensive sand-dune formations.42 The coast of P.E.I.\n","8144:  has been identified as one of the areas most sensitive to sea level rise in the entire country.\n","8146:  Parts of the North Shore of P.E.I.\n","8147:  are rated highly sensitive because this coast is exposed to the open Gulf of St. Lawrence, with potential wave-generating fetches44 of several hundred kilometres.\n","8148:  Decreased sea- ice cover in winter may increase the amount of open water fetch, creating larger waves superimposed on storm surges.45 Although Charlottetown Harbour is largely protected from the Northumberland Strait and the Gulf of St. Lawrence, relative sea level is rising and storm-surge events are increasingly common.\n","8149:  The provincial government has a major role in land use planning in P.E.I., managing about 90% of the land area in the province.\n","8151:  For the most part, municipal land use plans are more restrictive than provincial ones, although in the case of coastal area development, some municipalities are actually less restrictive than provided for in provincial legislation.\n","8152:  Relative sea level estimates for northwest and southwest P.E.I.\n","8154:  The northern coastal region of Labrador is ruggedly mountainous with deep fjords and few settlements.\n","8155:  The southern coastal region of Labrador has a rugged barren foreshore and light to moderate settlement.\n","8156:  In Newfoundland, the west coast is well-forested coastal plains with several fjord-like bays, the largest of which are the Bay of Islands and Bonne Bay.\n","8158:  The northeast coast, with its numerous bays, islands and headlands fronts on the Atlantic Ocean from the Great Northern Peninsula to the Avalon Peninsula.\n","8159:  The shoreline has innumerable bays, coves, islands and fjords _ it is also an area blocked on an annual basis by arctic drift ice throughout the winter and early spring.\n","8160:  Settlements have developed along the shores of most bays and on some off-shore islands.\n","8161:  The south coast has features typical of a submerged shoreline; namely offshore islands, spits, tombolos48 and bay-mouth bars (barachoix).49 (Historica-Dominion Institute 2012) (Shaw, et al.\n","8162:  1998) 42 43 44 Fetch refers to the length of water over which wind has blown and is a key factor in creating storm surges.\n","8163:  45 46 47 48 A narrow strip of sand that links one island to another or to the mainland.\n","8164:  49 (Shaw, et al.\n","8165:  1998) (Richards and Daigle 2011) (Newfoundland & Labrador Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture 2011) (Historica-Dominion Institute 2012) 18 Over 90% of the population is located in coastal communities, including the capital of St. John_s which is home to just over a third of total population.50 Although, sea level rise has been documented throughout the province,51 most of the coastline of Newfoundland and Labrador is of moderate to low sensitivity to sea level change.\n","8166:  In many areas of the province, the presence of relatively steep-sloping bedrock-exposed coastlines means sea level rise will have little impact.\n","8167:  Notable exceptions to this include the northwest coast of the Burin Peninsula and St. George_s Bay as well as specific communities such as Placentia.52 With ongoing relative sea level rise, storm surge activity is likely to have a progressively stronger impact on higher areas of the shoreline.\n","8168:  Areas at greatest risk are sand dominated beaches, coastal dune complexes, tidal flats, estuaries and salt marshes.53 In the Northern Strategic Plan released in 2007, the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador recognized the need for a targeted action plan to address climate change in Northern Labrador.\n","8169:  In the 2011 Climate Change Action Plan _Charting Our Course_, the provincial government committed to preparing a dedicated strategy on climate change adaptation for Northern Labrador.54 The plan highlights a number of climate change adaptation strategies for the province including integrating adaptation considerations into public and private sector decision-making, and considering climate change implications in the site selection and design of provincial government buildings and infrastructure.\n","8170:  In June of 2011, the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador released a Coastal and Oceans Management Strategy and Policy Framework for public discussion.\n","8171:  The need for a provincial coastal land use plan was stated, taking into account the principles of sustainable development, climate change adaptation, hazard prediction and preparedness, and economic development.55 This document identifies that to be proactive in addressing coastal and ocean issues, the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador must take a leadership role and engage in meaningful integrated coastal and ocean management processes.\n","8172:  A key existing provision noted in the document is to maintain a 15 metre shoreline reservation or buffer between the shoreline and the boundary of current land titles issued by the Department of Environment and Conservation.\n","8173:  Available data on recent sea level change indicates relative sea level is currently rising across much of the Island of Newfoundland, is stable or rising in northern Newfoundland and southern Labrador, and is falling in much of central and northern Labrador.\n","8174:  For the east coast of Labrador, sea level is estimated to rise by 0.80 m to the year 2099.\n","8175:  However, for those areas with the greatest concentration of the provincial population, the Avalon Peninsula and the west coast, a potential sea level rise of 0.80 to 1.0+ m by 2099 is anticipated.56 (Government of Newfoundland and Labrador n.d.)

Innu following a 2005 treaty between the Labrador Inuit Association, the Government of Canada, and the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador.\n","8176:  (Newfoundland & Labrador Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture 2011) (Batterson and Liverman 2010) 55 56 19 Framework for Decision-Making Framework for Decision-Making Communities need adaptation strategies and tools to minimize the long-term economic, environmental and social impacts of sea level rise on development in coastal areas.\n","8177:  Adaptation strategies can be grouped into four broad categories:57 Protect is a reactive strategy to protect people, property and infrastructure from sea level rise and is typically the first response considered.\n","8178:  Protecting the coastline through structural mechanisms such as dikes,58 seawalls and groynes has been the traditional approach to dealing with sea level rise in many parts of the world.59 Such measures range from large-scale public projects to small-scale efforts by individual property owners.\n","8179:  Protection strategies tend to be expensive and may have limited long-term effectiveness in highly vulnerable locations.60 A protect strategy alone creates an expectation that coastal defences will be maintained in perpetuity, which may lead to a false sense of security.\n","8180:  It may also compound risk by encouraging further development behind dikes and other structural protection elements, thereby increasing the number of people and amount of property at risk if these fail.\n","8182:  Communities may use a protect strategy as an interim measure, providing time to implement a retreat or avoid strategy; however the strategy should be recognized as a temporary solution and not used to encourage further development.\n","8183:  Other forms of protection can take place.\n","8184:  There is growing recognition of the benefits of non-structural (soft armouring) protection measures, including beach nourishment and coastal wetland restoration and creation.\n","8185:  These measures can be implemented as sea levels rise, and may complement or supplement structural protection.\n","8186:  Such non-structural adaptations can enhance the natural resilience of the coastal zone and can be less expensive than structural protection, which can lead to unwanted effects on erosion and sedimentation patterns if not properly implemented.61 Accommodate is an adaptive strategy that allows continued occupation of coastal areas while changes are made to human activities and/or infrastructure to adapt to sea level rise.\n","8187:  Accommodation can also involve retrofitting a building or making it more resilient to the consequences of sea level rise.\n","8189:  Strategies such as covenants indemnifying governments from the consequences of coastal hazards may also be used to reduce local government liability.\n","8190:  Retreat (or Managed Retreat) refers to any strategic decision to withdraw, relocate or abandon private or public assets at risk due to coastal hazards.\n","8191:  Retreat is an adaptive strategy designed to limit the use of structural protections, discourage development in areas subject to sea level rise, and plan for the eventual relocation of buildings and infrastructure to areas with no risk or a lesser risk.\n","8192:  Communities in Prince Edward Island have applied this strategy where storms have resulted in significant shoreline loss.\n","8193:  57 Note: Although these strategies are commonly used, there is considerable variation in their organization and description.\n","8195:  58 The spelling of dike and dyke (also dikeland and dykeland) are both commonly used in Canada.\n","8196:  The term dike is preferred by the Government of B.C.\n","8197:  and has been used throughout this report except where the spelling of dyke is contained in a legislative reference or publication.\n","8198:  (Adaptation _ Coastal Zone 2007) (Adaptation _ Coastal Zone 2007) (Adaptation _ Coastal Zone 2007) 59 60 61 21 Managed retreat is a strategy typically undertaken with a long-term perspective.\n","8199:  Small scale managed retreat may include site-specific relocation within a property or relocation to another site.\n","8200:  Large scale relocation may include an entire community.\n","8201:  As part of a managed retreat strategy, homes, lighthouses, roads and even barns have been moved further inland to protect them from erosion and storm surge.\n","8202:  The strategy is often used when property owners have enough room on their parcel or when the ongoing costs of storm repairs and safety concerns outweigh the costs of retreating.\n","8203:  The strategy may also be used to provide space for coastal ecosystems to expand or reclaim areas as the sea level rises.62 Managed retreat is not currently used as frequently as other strategies.\n","8204:  There is often a threshold (e.g.\n","8205:  number of coastal residents or value of properties at risk) above which retreat becomes less likely.\n","8206:  Retreat from urbanized areas is theoretically possible but politically difficult, and there are few (if any) examples of successful and peaceful retreat in densely populated areas.\n","8207:  However, it is anticipated that the use of managed retreat will increase in the future as the rate of sea level rise increases or the cost of a protect or accommodate strategy becomes excessive.\n","8208:  Avoid involves planning so that development does not take place in areas subject to coastal hazards associated with sea level rise or where the risk is low at present but will increase over time.\n","8209:  This may involve identifying future _no build_ areas within local government planning documents.\n","8210:  A wide range of planning tools may be involved in coming to a decision to avoid development in areas subject to moderate to high risk.\n","8211:  Regulatory tools may include the designation or zoning of lands for limited development or nonhabitable uses.\n","8212:  An avoid strategy may include land acquisition or restriction tools such as a land trust, or the transfer of development potential to areas with low or no risk due to sea level rise.\n","8213:  Business as Usual is not specifically included as a strategy in this Primer but it can be considered as a composite of existing strategies.\n","8214:  All four adaptation strategies are currently applied to varying degrees in different local government jurisdictions throughout coastal Canada.\n","8215:  It would be inappropriate to call _business as usual_ a _do nothing_ strategy as there is widespread recognition of coastal risks and the application of various tools to address risk.\n","8216:  However, the consequences of _business as usual_ are not neutral as sea level rise will lead to increased vulnerability or require the use of new tools, a different mix of tools and higher expenditures.\n","8217:  If nothing is done, the consequences of Business as Usual will mean the acceptance of additional risk, whether by intention, omission or lack of resources.\n","8218:  An attack strategy refers to options that reclaim land from the sea through dredging, diking, etc.\n","8219:  These are also referred to as land reclamation, land claim, or _advance the line._ This strategy has seen some application in other jurisdictions, particularly in the Netherlands, Hong Kong and Singapore.\n","8221:  In these jurisdictions, some low-lying land has been diked and/or filled to accommodate agriculture, port and airport development, and for residential purposes.\n","8222:  In the Dutch case, the current use of ocean sediment dredged from one location to another represents a form of soft armouring to protect vulnerable areas behind dikes.\n","8223:  An attack strategy refers to measures that reclaim land from the sea through dredging, diking and fill.\n","8224:  This strategy is also referred to as land reclamation, or _advancing the line_ and has seen some application in other jurisdictions, particularly in the Netherlands, Hong Kong and Singapore.\n","8225:  An attack strategy is not considered a viable response to sea level rise in Canada.\n","8226:  The economic and environmental costs of land reclamation, wherever implemented, are extremely high.\n","8228:  2011) 62 63 Local infilling to create or enhance harbours and farmland has historically occurred in Atlantic Canada and in the Lower Mainland of British Columbia but is considered to have minimal applicability for the future due to prohibitive costs and environmental impacts.\n","8229:  22 Sea Level Rise Adaptation Process Developing and implementing sea level rise adaptation measures at a local level does not begin with the implementation of an adaptation tool.\n","8230:  Prior to the implementation of any of the adaptation tools discussed in this Primer, a process of information gathering, public education and community engagement should be undertaken by local community decision makers.64 Figure 5 - Sea Level Rise Adaptation Framework _ Internal capacity building _ Study of local conditions that could modify sea level rise _ GIS mapping _ Assessment of potential local impacts of sea level rise _ Determination of cost implications of different adaptation tools _ Assessment of risk and

process of information gathering, including risk and vulnerability assessment, local governments will be able to identify their resource limitations and any knowledge gaps.\n","8231:  This process may involve building internal capacity, identifying champions and establishing a cross-departmental steering committee to address sea level rise.\n","8232:  After sufficient baseline information has been gathered, public education and community engagement should begin.\n","8233:  The inclusion of community input at this early stage can help foster a sense of ownership and provide valuable information that may otherwise be overlooked.\n","8234:  While public education and community engagement are shown in Figure 5 as one part of the process, in practice they should be included throughout the adaptation process.\n","8235:  Establishing community priorities and a preferred strategic direction will help narrow down the choice of adaptation tools that may be applicable in individual communities.\n","8236:  Many of the adaptation tools identified in this Primer will require ongoing public input and support to be successfully implemented.\n","8237:  As the science of estimating sea level rise and its effects evolves, so too will adaptation.\n","8238:  In order to incorporate new data into the adaptation process and assess the effectiveness of adaptations tools already implemented, monitoring and evaluation are required to feed back into the process.\n","8239:  The following provides a brief introduction and some examples of information gathering and engagement.\n","8240:  64 A community may be undertaking other climate change impacts at the same time.\n","8241:  23 Information Gathering Information gathering in the context of this Primer refers to the identification of the potential effects of sea level rise, the identification of areas at risk from associated coastal hazards and the assessment of vulnerability.\n","8242:  This provides a baseline and serves to guide decision makers, stakeholders and the community.\n","8243:  Such information can be converted and used to spatially depict _coastal hazard zones_ or _sea level rise planning areas_ (see Figure 6 _ Sketch of Coastal Hazard Mapping Components).\n","8244:  Mapping environmental constraints and opportunities can demonstrate land sensitivity, including: lands vulnerable to sea level rise; increases in tidal surges; changes in low and high tides; increases in coastal and riparian flooding; changes in high and low water tables; and impacts on aquatic and terrestrial habitats.\n","8245:  Before determining possible responses, a discussion of sea level rise should take place.\n","8246:  Relevant topics may include the following: _ How will the environment change?\n","8247:  _ What impacts can be anticipated?\n","8249:  _ What is the nature and magnitude Figure 6 - Sketch of Coastal Hazard Mapping Components65 UPLAND Cross-Section The

Additional work identified adaptation strategies for the municipalities most at risk from sea level rise.\n","8263:  This collaborative research proved instrumental in the development of subsequent municipal regulations.\n","8264:  The Government of Newfoundland and Labrador has made a three-year commitment to establish a new Coastal Erosion and Mapping Program so that data and reports will be available to all communities for planning and development purposes.\n","8265:  The New Brunswick District Planning Commissions manage and plan for development in their areas and provide advice to the province and municipalities with respect to community planning.\n","8266:  As an integral part of their mandate, Planning Commissions provide access to building inspectors, GIS technicians and a development officer to communities in their regions.\n","8267:  In Halifax, Nova Scotia, the local government has a current project to develop wave modeling for Halifax Harbour as a critical addition to the ongoing development of the Halifax Regional Municipality_s overall adaptive land use planning approach.\n","8268:  Fisheries and Oceans Canada _ Aquatic Climate Change Adaptation Services Program 68 In 2011 the Government of Canada committed $16.5 million for implementation of a five-year aquatic climate change program called the Aquatic Climate Change Adaptation Services Program.\n","8269:  This program is funding: _ Research projects to expand our understanding of how climate change will impact the delivery of Fisheries and Ocean_s Canada programs and policies; _ The development of adaptation tools to enable integration of climate change considerations into the delivery of Fisheries and Oceans Canada programs and policies, including work to: _ Develop high resolution modelling of changes in extreme sea level and ocean waves; _ Produce high resolution digital elevation models in intertidal and shallow zones.\n","8270:  68 Public Education and Community Engagement Public education and engagement help communities to increase their understanding of how communities may be directly affected by sea level rise now and in the future.\n","8272:  Ideally, public education and community engagement should take place throughout the adaptation process to ensure transparency in the decision-making process.\n","8273:  Approaches to engagement may include: _ Understanding how communities may be directly affected by sea level rise now and in the future by applying various tools and approaches, such as visualizations, scenarios and mapping; _ Making information available from a wide variety of sources; _ Holding public information seminars, workshops and conferences.\n","8274:  68 69 (Fisheries and Oceans Canada 2013) (Barron, et al.\n","8275:

in the public domain, the consequences and the need for adaptation may still be a _hard sell_ because the time frame is very long and changes will be incremental.\n","8281:  This challenge must be recognized and taken into consideration when designing public education and community engagement processes.\n","8282:  Long term residents can play an important role in communicating past extreme events.\n","8283:  Canadian Examples In British Columbia, the Corporation of Delta partnered with the University of British Columbia_s Collaborative for Advanced Landscape Planning (CALP) to develop future sea level rise scenarios using 2D and 3D visualisations.\n","8284:  The visual materials generated by this project have been used by staff and a citizens_ working group to help them understand the impacts, assess the policy implications and measure the social acceptability of various adaptation strategies.\n","8285:  In Quebec, following the release of coastal erosion research in the C_te-Nord, over 100 information sharing meetings and consultations took place.\n","8286:  These meetings played an important role in developing public support for new coastal setbacks.\n","8287:  Scenario-Based Planning Due to the _forward looking_ nature of climate change planning and its reliance on climate models to estimate future impacts, there is an inherent degree of uncertainty involved in the planning process.\n","8288:  One popular community engagement approach for addressing and accounting for uncertainties in climate predictions is scenario-based planning.\n","8289:  Scenario-based planning will typically begin with the creation of a baseline scenario of current land use, management and other stressors.\n","8290:  Predicted changes (e.g.\n","8291:  expected/proposed development, sea level rise and increased storm surge) and possible elements of interest (e.g.\n","8292:  ecological and community infrastructure features) to these stressors are then modelled to create future scenarios.\n","8293:  From these scenarios, decision makers can begin to identify thresholds of change _ that is, points at which significant impacts will be realized and various management options can be _tested_ to see which maybe most effective.\n","8294:  Several tools have been developed in the United States to help specifically with scenario based planning.\n","8296:  26 Adaptation Tools Adaptation Tools The following section provides an analysis of a variety of adaptation tools and their applicability in communities on Canada_s southern coasts.\n","8297:  In each case, a general description of the tool is given, its implementation is discussed, and enabling legislation is noted.\n","8298:  In addition, economic, environmental and social criteria are discussed, as are the potential barriers or challenges to implementation.\n","8299:  A total of 21 tools are identified in this Primer.\n","8300:  They have been organized into five general categories: n Planning tools identified in this Primer consist of local and regional government planning and management objectives and policies, mapping of potential hazards, risk management and emergency planning.\n","8301:  n Regulatory tools include the regulation of subdivision, land use and buildings.\n","8303:  The gatekeeper may consist of the municipal council, regional board or other form of local government, building inspector or subdivision approving officer.\n","8304:  n Land use change or restriction tools focus on land use change or the restriction of land use other than through the regulatory functions noted above.\n","8305:  Some of these tools are at the disposal of local government and others have the potential to achieve local government goals indirectly, for example the acquisition of land through a Land Trust.\n","8306:  n Structural tools (flood protection works) consist of physical structures on land or in water to protect land and buildings from coastal hazards.\n","8307:  A wide range of hard protection or armouring works fit into this category.\n","8308:  This grouping can be further broken down into on-site and off-site works, which are also referred to as property-specific and linear shoreline protection measures.\n","8310:  Both sand dunes and beaches are naturally occurring features, created by the interaction of wind and waves, and serve to dissipate the energy of storm surges and wave action.70 Structural and non-structural protection methods are frequently used in combinations called hybrid shoreline

framework in place.\n","8336:  Objectives and policies may be included in comprehensive plans, community plans, neighbourhood plans, strategic plans, and growth management strategies.\n","8337:  Objectives are often general in nature and may aim to accommodate future development, protect residents, manage risk on land subject to hazards, and protect environmentally sensitive areas.\n","8339:  Policies may include setbacks to avoid coastal areas at risk, environmentally sensitive criteria for development or other measures designed to reduce vulnerability and increase resilience.\n","8340:  Application Objectives and policies may be used as an adaptation tool in every coastal community in Canada.\n","8341:  They may also be added to existing policy frameworks such as Official Community

the protection of riverbeds, shorelines, coastlines and floodplains sets uniform setbacks based on grade and requires that a permit be obtained for new construction near shorelines.\n","8357:  The policy also bans all construction directly on the coastline.\n","8358:  Regional County Municipalities (RCMs) were encouraged to integrate measures for coastal protection, as outlined in the policy, within their regional master plans (Schema d_am_nagement).\n","8359:  As of 2012 all but seven of the 86 RCMs had adopted measures.71 New Brunswick_s Coastal Areas Protection Policy establishes setbacks for permanent structures.\n","8360:  This policy, which came into force in 2002, divided coastal areas into three sensitivity zones: _ Zone A _ the areas closest to the water (known as the coastal lands core area) including dunes, beaches, wetlands, dikelands and tidal flats; _ Zone B _ a 30 m area landward of Zone A designed to limit activity and provide a development buffer, and _ Zone C _ the areas beyond Zone B that form a transition from coastal to inland areas.\n","8361:  This policy is enforced through provincial environmental impact assessment legislation.\n","8362:  Provincial legislation also provides municipalities with the ability to incorporate these policies into their own requirements.\n","8363:  New Brunswick also has Watercourse and Wetland Alteration Regulations, which limit activities that take place within or close to a watercourse or wetland.\n","8364:  A permit is required before certain activities can take place within 30 metres of a watercourse.\n","8365:  Prince Edward Island has adopted shoreline setback regulations for subdivision and development under the Provincial Planning Act.\n","8366:  The province uses setbacks based on historical data, but is currently updating setbacks using with aerial photos of coastlines.\n","8367:  Under the Environmental Protection Act, P.E.I.\n","8368:  also requires that a watercourse, wetland and buffer zone activity permit be obtained for any temporary or permanent change made to or near a watercourse or wetland.\n","8369:  A permit is required for all such alterations made within 15 metres (49.2 feet) of any watercourse (including a coastal water body) or wetland boundary.\n","8370:  In Newfoundland and Labrador, the 1990 Urban and Rural Planning Act makes provision for regional and municipal planning including the setting of plan objectives and policies.\n","8371:  There are 281 municipalities in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador and about half of these have municipal plans; however many are outdated.\n","8372:  The Department of Environment has a _Policy for Development in Shore Water Zones_.\n","8373:  This policy establishes criteria for issuing permits under the Water Resources Act, for all development activities in and affecting shore water zones.\n","8374:  In marine situations, the high water level of a water body must allow for maximum waves, wind setup, storm surge and ultimate mean sea levels under global climatic forecasts for a 1:100 year design.\n","8375:  Evaluation and Governance Considerations Economic _ Economic considerations include the cost of developing and setting objectives and policies and the cost of implementing them.\n","8376:  The cost to undertake the process is easily measurable while the cost of implementation is much more difficult to assess.\n","8378:  Economic obligations associated with development in hazardous areas may increase (e.g., development in areas at risk of coastal hazards with no protection measures).\n","8379:  Environmental _ Development restrictions in environmentally sensitive areas and areas subject to coastal hazards have long been addressed through municipal planning objectives and policies.\n","8380:  Incorporating adaptation to sea level rise into these objectives and policies is a logical next step.\n","8381:  71 (Martel 2012) 31 Planning Tools Social _ Objectives and policies will need to complement other planning measures designed to manage residential growth and other forms of development, recreation and open space needs, community facilities and other infrastructure needs.\n","8382:  The successful implementation of new objectives and policies often depends on a strong public education and consultation process as they are developed.\n","8384:  In a regional goal-setting process such as a regional growth strategy, a mediation or arbitration process among the different municipal governments may be required in order to achieve agreement.\n","8385:  In implementing policies and objectives, it is important to differentiate binding and non-binding measures.\n","8386:  For example, the City of Vancouver increased Flood Construction Levels by an additional 1.0 m in January 2012 as a recommended but non-binding measure to address increased risk due to sea level rise.\n","8387:  This is expected to be followed by a mandatory requirement following further review and technical study.\n","8388:  Advantages Disadvantages Research and policy development in adapting to sea level rise may be time consuming and require a commitment of staff and financial resources.\n","8389:  The addition of policies to address sea level rise may add controversy, particularly _Avoid_ or _ Retreat_ strategies.\n","8390:  There is an established history of setting objectives and policies through a co-ordinated and comprehensive approach to land use planning and growth management in response to coastal hazards.\n","8391:  The planning process provides opportunities for public involvement and education.\n","8392:  The degree to which objectives are met and policies implemented can be measured and monitored over time.\n","8394:  Mapping provides the technical basis for land use planning in coastal areas and enables the development of floodplain bylaws.\n","8395:  The mapping of coastal areas at risk of flooding or erosion is a vital tool for land use planning.\n","8396:  Projected future sea levels can then be superimposed on a topographic map of coastal hazards to identify new areas subject to hazards.\n","8397:  A recent report commissioned by the B.C.\n","8398:  government identified four steps to develop coastal floodplain maps.\n","8399:  These were: _ Acquisition of detailed floodplain topography _ An engineering analysis of water level components and associated flood construction levels _ Preparation of floodplain maps indicating the areas subject to flood hazards and the magnitude of these hazards, and _ The preparation of a brief documenting the process.\n","8400:  32 Planning Tools The report also suggested that coastal floodplain maps contain the following elements: _ Flood Construction Levels (FCLs) to the years 2100 and 2200; _ Floodplain limits to 2100 and 2200; _ Sea level rise planning areas for 2100 and 2200; and _ Tsunami evacuation planning areas (if applicable).72 Coastal flood hazards are determined by the interaction of storm surges and waves with seabed bathymetry and coastal land cover.\n","8401:  To effectively map the extent of coastal hazards, accurate topographic data is required, ideally with a contour interval of 1 m or less.\n","8402:  The traditional method is to conduct field surveys of the topography.\n","8403:  However, LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data, collected from an aircraft using a laser, is increasingly being used.\n","8404:  LiDAR offers both an accurate and economical means of topographic mapping, particularly where large surface areas are involved.\n","8405:  The set of elevation points generated by a LiDAR survey can be brought into a geographical information system (GIS) and used to build surfaces that represent the earth_s topography with great precision.\n","8406:  This provides an ideal base map which can be used to determine coastal hazard risk.73 Ground surveys provide the highest accuracy; however, to cover an entire coastline using this method may be impractical and prohibitively expensive.\n","8407:  Ground surveys may be used to supplement or monitor the accuracy of the results received from LiDAR or other technologies.\n","8408:  Ground surveys are still required to establish ground and floodproof elevations at a specific site where the FCL has been derived from a floodplain map.\n","8409:  Floodplain map topography should not be relied upon to establish specific building elevations.74 An engineering analysis is then used to map areas at risk.\n","8410:  A review of long-term water level records is a key resource in assessing historic coastal flood levels and return periods.\n","8411:  For coastal areas, these records are collected by tide gauges, operated by the Canadian Hydrographic Service (CHS) of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO).\n","8413:  With sea level rise, hazard mapping will not only need to incorporate the increase in water levels, but the effects of storm surge, wind and tides, in various combinations.\n","8414:  These will vary depending on the local climatic conditions.\n","8415:  In recent years there has been a lack of sea ice during the winter months in several coastal areas of Atlantic Canada.\n","8416:  This lack of sea ice must also be documented as a coastal hazard.\n","8417:  The ice has historically provided a buffer for the coastline, but with reduced quantities, wave energy now often reaches the shoreline and hits exposed cliffs, glacial deposits, sand dunes, sand spits, barrier bars, marshes, shoreline protection systems and other coastal features.\n","8418:  National Park has been monitoring _ice foot_76 in recent years as they have observed significant damage to the park shoreline and dune systems after storm surges during winter months.\n","8419:  (Kerr Wood Leidal Associates Ltd. 2011) (Birch Hill GeoSolutions 2008) (Kerr Wood Leidal Associates Ltd. 2011) 72 73 74 75

Planning Tools Application Coastal hazard mapping may be used to identify areas at risk due to the adverse effects of sea level rise, direct new development away from these high risk areas and manage development in areas where the risk is minimal or can be mitigated.\n","8421:  Coastal hazard mapping complements and strengthens other adaptation options and increases stakeholder awareness of areas at risk.\n","8422:  As such, this tool may be applied to all coastal areas at risk of coastal hazards, irrespective of the other adaptation tools implemented.\n","8423:  In 1975 the federal government of Canada initiated the Flood Damage Reduction Program.\n","8424:  Under this program, mapping of floodplain regions was supported through a 50/50 cost shared basis with provinces.\n","8425:  Through this program over 700 communities in six provinces undertook flood hazard mapping _ of which a majority were in Quebec.\n","8426:  At a minimum, maps were required to identify areas subject to 1 in 100 year flood events.\n","8427:  adopted a design flood standard of 1 in 200 years, except on the Fraser River, where the 1948 flood of record was used.\n","8428:  Atlantic Canada and Quebec adopted a flood standard of 1 in 100 years.\n","8429:  Mapping under this program was completed by 2000.\n","8430:  Since 2000, coastal hazard mapping has progressed sporadically across the country.\n","8431:  As part of the Atlantic Regional Adaptation Collaborative, digital elevation mapping was completed for some coastal areas of Nova Scotia, including the Chignecto Isthmus, where an evaluation of flood risk to infrastructure was undertaken.\n","8432:  The Halifax Regional Municipality in collaboration with Natural Resources Canada has conducted flood hazard mapping, including extreme event data.\n","8433:  The results are reported in Halifax Harbour Extreme Water Levels in the Context of Climate Change, Scenarios for a 100-year Planning Horizon Geological Survey of Canada.\n","8434:  This report includes an understanding of present and future sea level rise, vertical land motion, extreme water levels (combined tide and surge), harbour seiche and wave run-up.\n","8435:  The Province of New Brunswick maintains a coastal erosion database, which presents long-term coastline and shoreline migration rates.\n","8436:  This data is generated through photogrammetric studies (air photos analyses) conducted by N.B.\n","8437:  Department of Natural Resources and collaborators (universities, colleges, NGOs, consultants, etc.).\n","8438:  This data is used to determine appropriate setbacks when new developments are being assessed in coastal areas.\n","8439:  current federal-provincial flood management programs do not cover updates to hazard mapping or hydraulic analysis, although both have been included as secondary components in some projects.\n","8440:  In Prince Edward Island a 30 cm rise has been observed at the Charlottetown tide gauge since 1900.\n","8442:  To identify vulnerable infrastructure and guide land use planning, hazard mapping has been undertaken across the province.\n","8443:  34 Planning Tools Evaluation and Governance Considerations Economic _ Developing hazard maps requires a commitment of both technical resources and funding.\n","8444:  This may include resources for: _ Engineering expertise in flood risk modelling; _ Topographic surveys (LiDAR or remote sensing) to provide information on land elevation, which will feed back into the flood risk model; _ Costs of collecting extreme event data such as water levels, wave heights, etc.\n","8445:  where this information is available; _ Cost of employing a Geographic Information System (GIS) specialist; and _ Cost of adding a coastal hazard layer or updating hazard information.\n","8446:  The economic impacts of the maps themselves depends on a wide variety of factors, including how they are presented and distributed as well as how they are applied to planning and outreach activities.\n","8447:  Environmental _ Coastal hazard mapping may incorporate environmental data such as coastal habitats at risk or sensitive ecosystems and enable better environmental protection for areas at risk.\n","8449:  Hazard maps also enable public education and action, however, if a community is unaware of the benefits of coastal hazard mapping, they may prefer to see public money spent on more tangible flood and erosion protection measures.\n","8451:  GIS based mapping enables the detailed calculation of land areas at risk, property values and building values as well as the identification of strategic assets.\n","8452:  These economic calculations can also provide the basis for better understanding the social and environmental considerations affecting vulnerable areas.\n","8453:  Maps have long been used to support planning and development.\n","8454:  In order for coastal hazard maps to effectively reduce future coastal hazard risk and facilitate sustainable development, the consideration of hazard maps must be integrated into planning procedures and periodically updated.\n","8455:  The required expertise and modelling capacity may not be locally available, especially in smaller local governments.\n","8456:  In addition, coastal hazards often cross jurisdictional boundaries.\n","8457:  To pool limited resources and address trans-boundary impacts, work at a regional scale _ with support from various levels of government _ is often the most effective approach to hazard mapping.\n","8458:  35 Planning Tools Advantages Disadvantages There is a history of using hazard maps to support planning and development policies by identifying high risk locations and steering development away from these areas.\n","8459:  The identification of new or emerging risk areas helps with effective emergency response plans.\n","8460:  It is essential that certain infrastructure, such as electricity supplies, sewage treatment, and services, such as the emergency services, continue to function during a hazard event.\n","8461:  The creation of hazard maps allows communities to locate these elements in low risk areas.\n","8462:  Alternatively, mapping may highlight a requirement to defend these elements from coastal hazards.\n","8463:  Coastal hazard mapping can quantify what is at risk (e.g.\n","8464:  the number of houses or businesses).\n","8465:  This can assist in managing risk by helping set priorities and determining the most suitable strategy.\n","8466:  The creation of coastal hazard mapping promotes greater awareness of the risks of sea level rise.\n","8467:  This can be beneficial in encouraging hazard zone residents to prepare for the occurrence of flooding.\n","8468:  By identifying buildings at risk of flooding, awareness raising campaigns can also be targeted at high risk properties.\n","8469:  Risk Management In itself, new coastal hazard mapping will not cause a reduction in risk nor address sea level rise.\n","8470:  The information must be integrated into other regulatory, land use change, and structural and non-structural tools before the full benefits can be realised.\n","8471:  To realise the full benefits of coastal hazard mapping, it is important to provide people in the areas at risk with information about emergency procedures and ways of reducing risk.\n","8472:  If information on what to do in the event of an emergency is not provided, coastal hazard maps may serve to increase fear and anxiety, as residents are more aware of the risks.\n","8473:  The collection of topographic and bathymetric data to complement extreme water level and wave height information could be expensive.\n","8474:  Due to the lack of observed extreme event data, more advanced, accurate coastal hazard maps are likely to rely on complex numerical models.\n","8475:  This requires a degree of expertise to implement.\n","8477:  Tool Description Risk management is a process widely used to identify and manage the adverse impacts of a change in conditions.\n","8478:  The magnitude of a risk is calculated by examining the probability of the occurrence of an event and the severity of its impact.77 Risk management with respect to sea level rise and associated coastal hazards generally has two components.\n","8479:  The first involves the identification, assessment, measurement, and prioritization of risks from sea level rise (risk assessment).\n","8480:  The second involves selecting and implementing management measures.\n","8481:  The measurement process may be quantitative, such as calculating the probability of a flood in excess of current linear protection, or it may be qualitative, documenting increasing vulnerability and reduced resilience.\n","8482:  Coastal hazards due to sea level rise may include the risk of a major disaster such as a dike failure as well as risks from gradual changes such as increasing salinization of groundwater.\n","8483:  A risk assessment may have aspects that affect people, the environment and the economy.\n","8484:  Risk management methodologies can also provide a way to explore public attitudes and perceptions of risk _ information which can be fed back into the assessment.78 The setting of priorities reflects the importance of the coastal hazard and leads to a discussion on how those risks should be managed.\n","8485:  77 78 (Richardson and Otero 2012) (Richardson and Otero 2012) 36 Planning Tools Application Sea level rise has been identified as a risk in the academic literature for at least two decades.\n","8486:  The design of sea level rise risk-management strategies relies on sea level rise projections, which are constantly being revised based on new data and research.\n","8487:  Risks due to sea level rise have increased in recent years due to various aspects of climate change, including the more rapid melting of glaciers, higher water and atmospheric temperature readings around the globe and more intense storm activity.\n","8488:  As noted previously, considerable regional variation in sea level rise will take place.\n","8489:  With sea level rise, increased protection measures will be required just to maintain the same level of protection (i.e., 1:100 years or 1:200 years) that has been historically provided.\n","8490:  When the Canadian Flood Damage Reduction Program was created in 1975, minimum federal standards with respect to acceptable flood risk were set at a 1 in 100 year flood.\n","8491:  Should a higher level of protection be called for, additional measures will be required.\n","8492:  Whether the standard of protection remains the same or is increased, other approaches to risk management may be required.\n","8493:  These may include tools such as land acquisition, land trust, covenant or easement and soft armouring to reduce impact.\n","8494:  Enabling Legislation A risk assessment does not require specific enabling legislation.\n","8495:  It can occur in the preparation of an Official Community Plan or other planning process as authorized by provincial legislation.\n","8496:  Risk management may also be undertaken as part of an emergency planning and preparedness initiative.\n","8497:  For example, In Qu_bec, the 2001 Loi sur la s_curit_ civile (Law on civil security), Chapter IV, Section III obliges municipal officials to publicly communicate all known major risks and develop regulations for risk management.\n","8498:  Evaluation and Governance Considerations Economic _ Risk management involves a rigorous process of comparing and selecting the most appropriate risk reduction measures.\n","8499:  It can also include an analysis of the cost of _doing nothing._ A cost- benefit analysis _ used to determine how well, or how poorly, a planned action will turn out _ can assist the risk management process.\n","8500:  A cost benefit analysis is most commonly undertaken where the costs and benefits can be quantified in financial terms, to enable comparability.\n","8501:  It relies on the addition of positive factors and the subtraction of negative ones to determine a net result.\n","8502:  37 Planning Tools The two main applications of a cost-benefit analysis for risk management with respect to coastal hazards are: _ To determine if the proposed action is a sound financial decision.\n","8503:  (Can it be justified?\n","8504:  Is the proposed action feasible?)\n","8505:  _ To provide a basis for comparing possible projects (e.g., dike vs. seawall + beach nourishment).\n","8506:  This involves comparing the total expected cost of each option against the total expected benefits, to see if the benefits outweigh the costs, and by how much.\n","8507:  A _multiple account_ cost-benefit analysis recognizes that all values are complex and that not all consequences can be expressed in monetary terms or incorporated into one summary measure of net benefit.\n","8508:  Environmental _ Risk management may be used to reduce sea level rise risks to environmental assets and species at risk.\n","8509:  The protection of wetlands is of particular importance due to historic losses, as are intertidal areas, due to their high productivity.\n","8510:  Social _ Social criteria is embedded into most risk management processes.\n","8512:  The experience of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 demonstrated the extreme vulnerability of persons lacking mobility, particularly those with low income and the residents of nursing homes.\n","8513:  Implementation Measures and Challenges Implementation of risk management measures depends on the overall strategy adopted and the tool or combination of tools selected to manage identified risk within acceptable levels.\n","8515:  Advantages Disadvantages A long-term perspective is often required to manage risks to large scale linear infrastructure.\n","8516:  Risk management allows for a phased or cumulative risk management approach.\n","8517:  Risk management may involve a rigorous, defensible analytic approach with reliable information used to support decision making.\n","8518:  Risk management can be an essential tool to help determine the most appropriate response to coastal hazards.\n","8519:  There may be a significant cost.\n","8520:  However, the cost must be measured against the risk.\n","8521:  The absence of detailed studies may impede some initiatives but should not prevent the use of interim measures to reduce risk (e.g.\n","8522:  minimum setback and elevation from the natural boundary or other potential risk).\n","8523:  38 Planning Tools 4.\n","8524:  Emergency Planning and Preparedness Tool Description Emergency planning and preparedness measures are undertaken in advance of a disaster.\n","8525:  Coastal flooding may result in property damage, damage to or destruction of property contents, economic losses due to severed transportation links and other damaged infrastructure.\n","8526:  It may also result in loss of land due to erosion, business disruption in the affected area, population/community displacement, health and safety hazards and even death.\n","8527:  Effective emergency planning and preparedness reduces the damage caused by such events.\n","8528:  Post-disaster management refers to measures undertaken during and after a disaster and are discussed separately following the discussion of adaptation tools.\n","8529:  Application Emergency planning and preparedness measures may be undertaken in all coastal areas at risk of coastal hazards, irrespective of the other adaptation tools implemented.\n","8530:  Between 1970 and 2013, the federal government administered the Joint Emergency Preparedness Program (JEPP) to support disaster preparedness through funds provided to provincial and territorial governments.\n","8531:  This program provided financial assistance of up to 75% of a specific project to a maximum of $3,000,000, and focused specifically on increasing local government emergency response capability.\n","8532:  In B.C., under the Emergency Program Act, local authorities have primary responsibility for responding to emergencies and must have an emergency plan in place to address potential flood events and maintain public safety.\n","8533:  The Province provides support to local authorities depending on the magnitude of the event.\n","8534:  Local authorities: _ must prepare a local Emergency Plan; _ must establish and maintain an Emergency Management Organization; _ may cause the plan to be implemented; _ may declare a state of local emergency; and _ may do all acts and implement all procedures that it considers necessary to prevent, respond to or alleviate the effects of an emergency or disaster.\n","8535:  The emergency management of floods consists of several phases.\n","8536:  This tool covers the first phase _ emergency planning and preparedness for a flood.\n","8537:  Later phases concern flood response and recovery/ disaster financial assistance.\n","8539:  In 1999, to assist local and diking authorities to prepare a flood response plan, the B.C.\n","8540:  Water Management Branch and the Provincial Emergency Program (PEP) published the Flood Planning and Response Guide for British Columbia.79 This document includes sections on flood prevention, flood damage prevention, the preparation and implementation of a flood response plan and post flood management.\n","8541:  79 The Guide also provides assistance for preparation of a Flood Response Plan.\n","8542:  More detail is available at

with emergencies of various types, including floods.\n","8545:  People are encouraged to establish Neighbourhood Emergency Preparedness Programs to help individuals and neighbours prepare to be self-sufficient for an extended period.\n","8547:  In Nova Scotia, under the Emergency Management Act, each municipality is required to establish and maintain an emergency measures bylaw, an emergency measures organization with an appointed coordinator, establish an advisory committee consisting of members of the municipal council and prepare and approve an emergency measures plan.80 Similar provisions are in place in New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island.\n","8548:  the Office of Public Safety assists communities in upgrading their existing emergency response plans.\n","8549:  Their municipal emergency management guide outlines key components and steps to help communities to develop plans, create exercises and ensure resources have been identified before an emergency occurs.\n","8550:  A municipal self-assessment tool helps municipalities identify key areas of focus and to ensure hazards are clearly understood.\n","8552:  Evaluation and Governance Considerations Economic _ Economic considerations include the cost and resources of preparing emergency plans, co-ordinating with other agencies and obtaining resources for plan implementation.\n","8553:  Input in the form of assistance _ technical and monetary _ for the preparation of emergency plans or planning may come from higher government departments, agencies, and NGOs.81 Environmental _ This tool is not intended to address environmental issues.\n","8554:  Social _ The primary objective of this tool is the protection of human life, followed by the maintenance of essential services and the protection of infrastructure and buildings.\n","8555:  This tool lays the groundwork to prepare for a possible emergency and undertake planning measures including the evacuation of an area to protect human life.\n","8557:  Staff training is essential and _dry runs_ are highly desirable to test the plans and response coordination.\n","8558:  This requires resources and commitment from dedicated personnel and the coordination of multiple stakeholders.\n","8559:  Advantages Disadvantages The quality and effectiveness of emergency management plans may vary depending on the level of interest and resources allocated.\n","8560:  The plans must be updated regularly to remain current.\n","8561:  The monitoring and enforcement of emergency response plans require time and resources.\n","8563:  Sea level rise represents one additional risk to be addressed.\n","8564:  The local government has the authority to declare a local emergency, which may be due to sea level rise.\n","8565:  Emergency planning demonstrates that hazards are real, particularly when public education is included with the planning process.\n","8566:  Emergency management starts from the ground up and involves teamwork with other agencies and the Province.\n","8567:  80 81 (Birch Hill GeoSolutions 2008) (Birch Hill GeoSolutions 2008) 40 Planning Tools Regulatory Tools 1.\n","8568:  Regulation of Land Use Tool Description Land use can be regulated through neighbourhood plans, character guidelines, capital works plans, strategic plans, growth management plans and setback regulations.\n","8569:  Land use can also be regulated through the establishment of appropriate zoning within areas subject to or potentially subject to coastal hazards.\n","8570:  Zoning can regulate a wide range of activities, including restrictions on land uses, land use densities, setbacks, siting circumstances and servicing standards.\n","8572:  The three key elements of land use regulation pertaining to sea level rise and coastal hazards consist of minimum building setbacks from coastal hazards or structural protection from coastal hazards, minimum elevation of buildings in relation to flood risk, and restrictions on land use.\n","8573:  This tool can also be used to create new composite zones, such as a Sea Level Rise Planning Areas.\n","8574:  Enabling Legislation In B.C., under Section 903 of the Local Government Act, a local government may by bylaw divide the whole or part of the municipality or regional district into zones, name each zone, establish their boundaries and regulate the use of land, siting and density of buildings and other structures within each one.\n","8575:  This legislation could be used to create new zones with respect to coastal areas and enable a local government to regulate the use of land.\n","8576:  In B.C., provincial guidelines82 call for new construction containing habitable space to be located above the historical 1 in 200 year flood event plus an additional safety margin (called freeboard) to deal with uncertainty.\n","8577:  The resulting elevation is called the Flood Construction Level (FCL).\n","8578:  Section 910 of the Local Government Act allows a local government to designate as a flood plain, by bylaw, any area where it considers that flooding may occur on land.\n","8579:  When an area is designated as a flood plain, the bylaw may specify setbacks _ based on the provincial guidelines _ from the water or a dike and what structural support is required to elevate a floor system (or mobile home pad) above the flood level.\n","8581:  Zoning restrictions, minimum setbacks, lot grading, minimum building elevations and erosion protection are all commonly used to mitigate hazard risks.\n","8582:  In Quebec, provincial setback lines differ based on regional variations and available data on erosion rates.\n","8584:  From 2000 to 2004 a group of five ministries conducted precise erosion rate research in the C_te-Nord region.\n","8585:  From this research setbacks of between 60 and 160 metres were suggested for that region, depending upon the rate of erosion.\n","8586:  However, these suggested setbacks were not set as policy and therefore not widely adopted as regulation.\n","8587:  In 2011, a uniform 30-metre setback for all other coastal communities was proposed.\n","8588:  Many municipalities, however, have requested similar research and detailed erosion maps as were completed for the C_te-Nord to ensure they have irrefutable data in the face of potential legal challenges by coastal property owners.\n","8589:  The Province is in the process of commissioning detailed studies on erosion and subsidence rates in order to develop up-to-date precision maps for all the shorelines of Quebec.\n","8590:  Studies are being completed one area at a time in order of priority related to vulnerability.83 82 Flood Hazard Area Land Use Management Guidelines (May 2004) 83 (D_sgagn_s 2013) 41 Regulatory Tools Setbacks in _les-de-la-Madeleine Updated maps for the municipality of _les-de-la-Madeleine were completed in late 2012 by UQAR on commission by the province.\n","8591:  Once all the data has been translated into a directive by the province to the municipality, it has 120 days to integrate the new setback rules into its master plans, as per the loi sur l_am_nagement et l_urbanisme (Planning and Urban Planning Law), article 56.14.84 The municipality of _les-de-la-Madeleine is one of the most vulnerable areas of Quebec.\n","8592:  Zoning regulations adopted in 2010 increased the setback from 15 to 30 metres.\n","8593:  Although a provincial directive was not issued, this increase occurred as a result of public consultation and multi-stakeholder research on sea level rise in _les-de-la-Madeleine, undertaken by the Ouranos Consortium.\n","8594:  84 In New Brunswick, the Community Planning Act has a provision for municipalities and rural communities to enact a flood risk area bylaw with provincial approval.\n","8595:  Once such an area has been established, the bylaw can specify engineering standards, designs and techniques for development in flood risk areas.\n","8596:  This Act also allows for land use planning throughout the province and allows for the creation of District Planning Commissions.\n","8598:  Cap Bimet, Grand Barachois, N.B.\n","8599:  In Nova Scotia, the Province has designated land use or zoning powers to the municipalities through the Municipal Government Act and the Halifax Regional Municipality Charter.\n","8601:  These municipalities must follow the provisions of the Environmental Protection Act Watercourse and Wetland Protection Regulations, under provincial legislation.\n","8602:  Municipalities can alter the setback requirements specified in the Planning Act Subdivision and Development Regulations for setbacks from coastal areas and beaches.\n","8603:  (Province of Nova Scotia 2009) (Province of Nova Scotia 2009) 84 85 42 Regulatory Tools In Newfoundland and Labrador, responsibility for land use planning is shared by the provincial, federal, municipal, Innu Nation and Nunatsiavut governments.\n","8604:  The Department of Municipal Affairs generally focuses on communities, although the Urban and Rural Planning Act provides a broader mandate that includes regional planning, the setting of plan objectives and policies, zoning and implementation measures.\n","8605:  The Department of Environment and Conservation oversees ownership and use of the seabed within harbours and bays in the province and reviews all applications for land use to ensure compliance with existing regulations and policies.\n","8606:  The Department_s Policy for Development in Shore Water Zones establishes criteria for issuing permits for all development activities in and affecting shore water zones.86 This policy does not permit infilling, drainage, dredging, channelization, or removal of surface or underwater vegetation on or along shore water zones which could aggravate flooding problems.\n","8607:  Shoreline activities on crown land are covered by provincial rules, though some municipalities do have development guidelines that restrict what can happen in the buffer zone.\n","8608:  All individuals applying for unencumbered Crown land in Newfoundland and Labrador must maintain a 15 metre buffer zone between the shoreline and the boundary of the issued title though there is a reduction to 10 metres for residential lots and some older land grants are exempt.\n","8609:  As in other provincial jurisdictions, municipalities and regional planning authorities can implement measures under their own plans and bylaws to protect coastal areas from sea level rise, flooding, erosion or other hazards.\n","8610:  Newfoundland and Labrador has two regional planning authorities responsible for planning issues in their respective areas.\n","8611:  As an example, the regional planning authority for Corner Brook _ Humber Valley has included climate change adaptation as an issues to consider in their planning process.87 Evaluation and Governance Considerations Economic _ Land use restrictions, by their nature, confer development rights, with different rights for different zones and areas.\n","8612:  While these restrictions have significant economic implications, they may be introduced in the public interest, for example, to meet changing community needs and manage competing interests and conflict.\n","8613:  Environmental _ Regulation may facilitate identification and protection of environmentally sensitive areas and manage environmental hazards.\n","8614:  Social _ Regulation and zoning must be balanced to accommodate future population needs, while protecting infrastructure from hazards and locating essential services in low risk areas.\n","8617:  Related tools include topographic mapping to identify the location of areas at risk, and engineering expertise to address appropriate protection or adaptation measures needed to avoid the risk or reduce the risk to acceptable levels.\n","8618:  Technical requirements to address coastal flood risks may be expensive.\n","8619:  Public acceptance may also pose a challenge.\n","8620:  There may be challenges in cases where there is conflicting information on appropriate land use restrictions.\n","8621:  For example, in Quebec, C_te-Nord established a setback line using the probability of a 1-in-100 year flood event.\n","8622:  This conflicted with previous proposal to establish setbacks using the probability of a 1-in-25 year flood event.\n","8623:  This situation has resulted in potential grounds for legal challenges.\n","8624:  86 A shore water zone means the land that is intermittently occupied by water as a result of the naturally fluctuating surface water level in a body of water which can be either a fresh or salt water body and, in either case, the low water mark and high water mark of the water body defining the edges of the shore water zone.\n","8625:  87 See draft Humber Valley Regional Land Use Plan 2011-12.\n","8627:  Zoning gives a local government great flexibility in addressing different conditions and needs within its physical boundaries.\n","8628:  Zoning is well suited to public education and involvement.\n","8629:  Local government may not be able to impose zoning that will render the land sterile (i.e., unable to be used) but it can restrict the way in which land and buildings are used so that risks can be addressed.\n","8630:  Technical supporting documentation to address coastal flood risks may be expensive (e.g., floodplain mapping, design briefs, updated flood risk assessment, implementation measures to adapt to or reduce flood risk).\n","8631:  Interim measures may lack technical documentation but can be undertaken at modest cost (e.g.\n","8632:  sea level rise study area).\n","8633:  Subdivision Regulation Tool Description Subdivision regulation can be used to prevent or establish conditions for the subdivision of land at risk from coastal hazards associated with sea level rise.\n","8634:  A proposed subdivision must go through a review process, which culminates in the approval (including approval with conditions) or refusal of the proposed subdivision by the Approving Officer or other appointed official.\n","8635:  A subdivision refers to establishing a separate title of land.\n","8636:  This can include a simple property, bare land strata lot, or strata unit (e.g., townhouse, row house, or condominium unit in an apartment building).\n","8637:  Application This tool applies to the subdivision of land at risk of coastal hazards due to sea level rise and can be utilized in conjunction with zoning.\n","8638:  Enabling Legislation In most regions across Canada, subdivision decisions are governed by some form of an approving officer.\n","8639:  The nomenclature used to identify this approving officer, their specific role and level of government where the position is located varies in Quebec and Atlantic Canada but their basic _gatekeeper_ function is similar.\n","8640:  In B.C., the subdivision of land is an administrative responsibility given to an Approving Officer and is separate from the responsibility of an elected Council or Board.\n","8641:  An Approving Officer appointed by a municipality is typically the Municipal Engineer or Chief Planning Officer.\n","8642:  For small municipalities, the Approving Officer may be the Chief Administrative Officer or a person contracted to undertake that responsibility.\n","8643:  In non-municipal areas of regional districts, the Approving Officer is an employee of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure.\n","8644:  Under Section 86 of the Land Title Act, an Approving Officer may refuse to approve a plan for subdivision if the land is subject to, or could reasonably be expected to be subject to, hazards such as flooding and/or erosion.\n","8645:  A subdivision can also be refused if the cost to government of providing public utilities or other works and services would be excessive or if the subdivision would adversely affect the natural environment.\n","8646:  Section 86 also allows the Approving Officer to require a report by a qualified professional that the land may be used safely.\n","8647:  Under Section 219 of the B.C.\n","8648:  Land Title Act, the report is included in a covenant and registered as a charge on title and remains on the title of any parcels created by the subdivision, regardless of future ownership.\n","8651:  Municipalities or non-incorporated areas must still comply with the provincial Subdivision Regulations under the Municipal Government Act and the Environmental Protection Act in Nova Scotia.\n","8652:  the Environmental Protection Act requires an environmental impact assessment for undertakings which could have a significant effect on the environment including an effect on any unique, rare or endangered feature of the environment, or an effect which causes public concern.\n","8653:  This legislation has broad application and includes specific references to the alteration of wetlands, interfering with the movement of sand on a beach or sand dune, and the destruction of natural stabilizing features such as vegetation.\n","8654:  As a result, subdivision applications are reviewed through the provincial Environmental Impact Assessment process prior to issuing development permits.\n","8655:  N.B., N.S.\n","8656:  all have similar environmental provisions in place.\n","8657:  Evaluation and Governance Considerations Economic _ Economic considerations include the cost of allowing or avoiding development in an area subject to coastal hazards, the cost of providing flood protection, and the cost of adapting to the risk.\n","8658:  In the event of a flood, or if the risk increases and increased structural protection is required (e.g.\n","8659:  increased dike height), these costs may be borne by different levels of government.\n","8661:  Subdivision regulation can be used to address environmental issues such as suitability of land use and development impact.\n","8662:  Social _ Various public stakeholders and potential land owners may be affected by the approval or refusal to approve a subdivision.\n","8663:  An Official Community Plan or a similar guiding document may provide a framework for these decisions and provide guidance on the suitability of subdivision development; particularly for residential use.\n","8664:  Implementation Measures and Challenges This tool relies heavily on accurate information and coastal hazard mapping to provide grounds for the approval or refusal of a subdivision.\n","8665:  Implementation requires that an Approving Officer or similar designate exercise their authority to allow or refuse the subdivision of land at risk from coastal hazards.\n","8666:  Where the nature and extent of the risk has not been determined, the Approving Officer can withhold subdivision approval pending a report from a qualified professional.\n","8667:  A qualified professional (i.e., engineer or geoscientist) can determine mitigation measures that would allow the land use; however the Approving Officer still has the discretion to reject the subdivision.\n","8668:  Advantages Disadvantages Most local governments have the legal mandate to establish by bylaw the conditions under which the subdivision of land can proceed.\n","8669:  The role of the Approving Officer provides for some degree of separation from political influence.\n","8670:  The ability of an Approving Officer to protect the public interest by refusing to approve a subdivision has been well established by case law.\n","8671:  This tool allows the conditions of future development to be regulated.\n","8672:  The loss of potential development value could result in resistance from developers.\n","8673:  Reducing subdivision of coastal land should not be undertaken ad hoc or without supporting guiding policy or a strategy in place.\n","8674:  Without the identification of coastal hazard areas at risk of flooding and erosion, it is difficult for the approving body to decline subdivision on the grounds of safety.\n","8675:  Subdivision approval is discretionary; but is subject to the prescribed scope of authority.\n","8676:  The quality of decision making is dependent on the capabilities of those appointed.\n","8677:  45 Regulatory Tools 3.\n","8678:  Development Permit Tool Description A Development Permit is a form of land use regulation distinctive to B.C.\n","8679:  It is identified separately because it combines policy objectives and guidelines with site specific regulation.\n","8680:  A Development Permit can regulate development for a variety of purposes, two of which are applicable to sea level rise: _ protection of the natural environment, its ecosystems and biological diversity; and _ protection of development from hazardous conditions.\n","8681:  In the former case, a Development Permit Area (DPA) may specify areas of land that must remain free of development, except in accordance with any conditions contained in the permit, or require specified natural features or areas to be preserved, protected, restored or enhanced in accordance with the permit.\n","8682:  In the latter case, a DPA may specify areas of land that may be subject to flooding, mud flows, or torrents of debris, and specify the guidelines under which the objectives will be addressed.\n","8683:  In each case, the purpose of the Development Permit is for the specified objectives to be met prior to a development proceeding.\n","8684:  Application This tool is used to identify areas where special conditions apply.\n","8685:  The objectives of the Development Permit must be established and guidance given for addressing the objectives.\n","8686:  While this tool is specific to B.C.\n","8688:  For example, Halifax Regional Municipality is managing waterfront development in Halifax Harbour by development agreements in which proponents must account for sea level rise.\n","8689:  Enabling Legislation In B.C., a local government can establish Development Permit Areas under Section 919.1 of the Local Government Act.\n","8690:  A DPA and guidelines can be included in an Official Community Plan or a zoning bylaw.\n","8691:  Where a DPA has been designated by bylaw, no subdivision, building construction or alteration, or alteration of land can proceed unless a Development Permit has first been issued by the local government.\n","8692:  In order to address the hazardous conditions specified in the DPA, the local government may require that the applicant provide a report certified by a professional engineer.\n","8693:  When a local government has issued a Development Permit, it must file a notice in the Land Title Office that the land is subject to the conditions specified in the Development Permit.\n","8694:  If an OCP designates areas as requiring a Development Permit, this must be issued prior to the subdivision of land within the area and the construction of, addition to or alteration of a building or other structure.\n","8695:  Evaluation and Governance Considerations Economic _ The creation of Development Permit Areas and the granting or refusal of applications with respect to these areas involves an additional step in the development and permitting process.\n","8696:  The cost of the independent professional and the cost of meeting the Development Permit conditions can also be considerable.\n","8697:  The onus is on the applicant to demonstrate that land that might otherwise not be developed can be done so safely.\n","8698:  Environmental _ A DPA is one of the few tools available to a local government where the primary focus can be on protection of the natural environment and biodiversity.\n","8699:  Examples could include sand dunes, coastal bluffs, and beaches.\n","8700:  Social _ The establishment of a Development Permit Area in an OCP or zoning bylaw requires a public hearing.\n","8701:  46 Regulatory Tools Implementation Measures and Challenges Implementation requires that an Official Community Plan designate a DPA.\n","8702:  This includes an amending bylaw and public hearing.\n","8703:  Once a DPA is in place, a resolution of approval is required from the local government for a specific development.\n","8704:  The main challenge is preparing background studies of hazards and environmentally sensitive areas to justify the DPA.\n","8705:  Advantages Disadvantages Hazardous areas must be documented and identified prior to their designation.\n","8706:  Smaller jurisdictions may lack the necessary planning or technical resources.\n","8707:  The use of a Development Permit is an additional procedural requirement for a developer or landowner.\n","8708:  However, the additional time by itself can be as little as four weeks and a Development Permit can be processed concurrently with a rezoning or subdivision application.\n","8710:  A Development Permit cannot be turned down by the local government if the specified objectives and guidelines are met.\n","8711:  This can be an advantage as well as a disadvantage.\n","8712:  The use of a Development Permit enables land use planning objectives to be implemented prior to a development proceeding.\n","8713:  A DPA can be included in an Official Community Plan with a narrative describing the objectives that justify the designation and specifying the guidelines for addressing the objectives, accompanied by a map.\n","8714:  The scope is very broad, as it includes subdivisions, building construction (whether or not a building permit is required) and alteration of land (e.g.\n","8715:  re-grading, soil removal or soil deposition).\n","8716:  The use of a Development Permit allows for an independent professional to address risk (i.e., professional engineer with relevant expertise) at the applicant_s expense.\n","8717:  No change in existing legislation is needed to create a Sea Level Rise Development Permit Area or Coastal Hazard Development Permit Area.\n","8718:  Use of this tool requires a notice to be filed in the Land Title Office.\n","8719:  As a result, any purchaser is deemed to be notified of hazardous conditions.\n","8720:  Building Regulation Tool Description Local communities have a tools which can be used to influence the manner in which buildings are situated and constructed.\n","8721:  Application This tool is applicable to all building construction or significant retrofits.\n","8722:  The use of this tool is the last opportunity to avoid exposure to hazards, including coastal hazards.\n","8723:  Enabling Legislation Under the terms of the Constitution Act, building regulation in Canada is the responsibility of provincial and territorial governments.\n","8724:  The Canadian Commission on Building and Fires Codes works with stakeholders and researches to develop a model National Building Code.\n","8725:  Most provinces and territories have adopted the National Building Code or adapted it with variations and additions.\n","8726:  The National Building Code does not have specific design requirements to protect buildings from coastal hazards but does ensure that buildings are constructed to certain safety and design standards.\n","8727:  47 Regulatory Tools Although not all local governments in British Columbia have chosen to enforce the provincial code, technically, the code applies throughout the province.\n","8728:  In addition, through powers provided under section 910 of the Local Government_s Act municipalities may introduce certain construction requirements in a floodplains.\n","8729:  The City of Vancouver is unique among municipalities in B.C.\n","8730:  It has its own enabling provincial legislation called the Vancouver Charter.\n","8731:  Under this charter, Vancouver has developed a building bylaw which is based on the B.C.\n","8732:  Building Code, with local amendments.\n","8733:  This bylaw regulates buildings on lands subject to flooding by establishing minimum flood construction levels (FCLs), specifying construction materials, and service equipment installation, and allowing for covenants on a property title which acknowledge the risk of flood damage.\n","8734:  Community Charter provides an alternative way that building restrictions may be imposed to address flood hazards.\n","8735:  Under section 56 of this Act, a municipal building inspector may withhold the issuance of a building permit until satisfied the land can be safely used and can require a geotechnical report by a qualified professional if construction is proposed on land likely to be subject to hazards such as flooding or erosion.\n","8736:  A building permit can be refused until the owner agrees to a covenant on the property title stating that the land will only be used in the manner certified in the report.\n","8738:  In Quebec, adaptation to sea level rise is currently not addressed in provincial regulations governing the authority of local governments to deal with zoning bylaws, home-owner building permits or subdivisions.\n","8739:  The province develops planning strategies, then Regional County Municipalities (RCMs) are responsible for integrating the strategies in their Sch_mas d_am_nagement (regional plans), and the municipalities within the RCMs then enact bylaws and regulations to implement the measures in the Sch_ma.\n","8740:  The province develops policies and makes recommendations they hope the local authorities (cities) and regional authorities (RCMs) will adopt, however, there is no forced compliance from one level to the next.\n","8741:  In some cases, depending on the type of construction, permits can be issued by regional or provincial authorities.\n","8742:  In Atlantic Canada there is a general provision under provincial planning legislation for the granting of building permits in non-incorporated areas.\n","8743:  In Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, regional planning commissions can generate regional plans and bylaws.\n","8746:  In some cases, there are provisions in place to restrict development in areas vulnerable to coastal hazards.\n","8747:  In Prince Edward Island, the Planning Act, (Section 8), provides for the regulation of land use activities in non-incorporated areas.\n","8748:  The Planning Act, Subdivision and Development Regulations, provides measures for setbacks in coastal areas of a minimum width of 60 feet (18.3 metres) or 60 times the annual erosion rate for the area (Section 16).\n","8749:  In Newfoundland and Labrador, the Urban and Rural Planning Act empowers the formation of regional planning commissions in the province, and there are currently two commissions in place.\n","8750:  Evaluation and Governance Considerations Economic _ Building regulation as an adaptation tool has two primary purposes: the protection of property and public safety.\n","8752:  Local government review and processing costs and legal costs are likely to be modest to moderate.\n","8753:  Similarly, the cost of implementing protective measures vary widely.\n","8754:  In some cases a project may have to be abandoned if a qualified professional cannot certify that a building can be safely constructed for the intended use or that the cost for doing so would be excessive.\n","8755:  48 Regulatory Tools Environmental _ Building restrictions as an adaptation tool only address identified hazards including natural hazards such as erosion and flooding.\n","8756:  This regulatory tool is not intended to address environmental criteria.\n","8757:  Other planning tools that typically occur at an earlier stage in the development process should be used to address environmental criteria (e.g., growth management policies, easement, land purchase, subdivision, and zoning).\n","8758:  Social _ This tool is designed to address public safety.\n","8759:  The intent of this tool is to ensure that the occupants of a building are not subject to excessive risk.\n","8760:  If a building cannot safely be constructed in a particular location or if the cost of doing so is economically prohibitive then it will not be constructed, thus reducing the risk to people and property.\n","8761:  The use of this tool gives priority to the protection of the public.\n","8762:  Implementation Measures and Challenges In B.C.\n","8763:  the Community Charter and Local Government Act authorizes the local government building inspectors to withhold the issuance of a Building Permit unless a qualified professional can provide a report certifying the land can be used safely for the intended purpose.\n","8764:  Unfortunately, there are a limited number of qualified professionals for this specialized work.\n","8765:  One challenge cited mainly by smaller and more remote municipalities is a lack of knowledge as to who is qualified to undertake this specialized work and whether the conclusions arrived at are appropriate.\n","8766:  In some smaller communities, local government has chosen not to undertake a building inspection function and so in these areas, this tool cannot be used.\n","8767:  Advantages Disadvantages The key advantage of this tool is its ability to place restrictions on building construction until the hazard risk has been addressed.\n","8768:  This tool enables site specific measures to be incorporated as an integral part of the construction of a building.\n","8769:  An indirect advantage of this tool is its ability to prevent the transfer of risk from one property owner to another unknowing purchaser.\n","8770:  Registration of a covenant on title ensures that any future owner or prospective purchaser is aware of the site-specific building requirements.\n","8771:  (B.C.)\n","8772:  The application of this tool comes late in the development process.\n","8773:  This can be a concern if a property owner is not aware of any potential risk and only finds out when a building permit application is submitted.\n","8774:  Local governments may not have the technical resources to give guidance in determining the minimum elevation for safe building construction (i.e., Flood Construction Level).\n","8775:  This is a significant concern for local government officials with limited resources.\n","8776:  Reliance on a qualified professional introduces the risk of retaining a person who lacks the necessary skills.\n","8777:  the Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists are addressing this risk by preparing guidelines for qualified professionals working to mitigate flood risks and adapt to sea level rise.\n","8778:  Where building regulation or enforcement has not been adopted as a local government function, this tool will not be available.\n","8779:  49 Regulatory Tools Land Use Change or Restriction Tools 1.\n","8780:  Land Acquisition Tool Description Local governments can gain ownership of land for the primary purpose of addressing public safety through purchase or expropriation.\n","8781:  Land can be acquired for a variety of purposes, including structural protection works (i.e., a dike or other hard protection), vehicular access or setbacks for public safety.\n","8782:  Land can also be acquired to prevent the development or to hold it in public ownership for exclusive public use.\n","8783:  Application Land can be acquired to accommodate a new dike, for the landward expansion of an existing dike or as the land base needed for other forms of structural protection.\n","8784:  Land acquisition can be used to provide public open space, protect rare or endangered habitat or create an ecological reserve.\n","8785:  It can also be used to avoid the cost of servicing land at risk due to sea level rise.\n","8786:  Land purchase may take place to prevent the development of land subject to hazards, however if land is required for a public purpose, government cannot simply downzone land for exclusive public use without compensating the owner.\n","8787:  Expropriation is perceived as an option of last resort, as an independent third party or the courts are the final determinants of the land value.\n","8788:  Expropriation may also be referred to as a compulsory acquisition, compulsory purchase or eminent domain.\n","8789:  Enabling Legislation A municipality is authorized to expropriate property in accordance with the Expropriation Act under Section 31 of the Community Charter.\n","8790:  Similar provisions to acquire or expropriate land exist in Atlantic Canada.\n","8791:  Evaluation and Governance Considerations Economic _ Land acquisition is potentially expensive and there are ongoing costs and liability associated with ownership.\n","8792:  Any tax revenue generated from the land is forgone once it transfers to local government ownership.\n","8793:  Environmental _ This tool can be used to protect environmentally sensitive land where development is not advisable or for foreshore protection such as soft armouring.\n","8794:  Land acquisition may also be used to provide for public open space purposes subject to restrictions on improvements and the timing and extent of activities.\n","8795:  Social _ There are social considerations and impacts associated with the acquisition of private land to protect the public interest.\n","8796:  Local governments may have to acquire large sections of land necessary to expand a linear corridor (e.g.\n","8797:  dike or seawall).\n","8798:  Social benefits may include the acquisition of public open space and public access along a dike.\n","8799:  In communities where expropriation is used, there may be negative impacts to local landowners.\n","8800:  50 Land Use Change or Restriction Tools Implementation Measures and Challenges Key challenges in the acquisition of land include obtaining the necessary funds for a land purchase, agreeing on fair market value and obtaining political support for land expropriation.\n","8801:  Land expropriation is typically undertaken by a local government but may include a provincial government agency.\n","8802:  Strategic or Official Community Plans may identify properties needed for future land acquisition and, if so, make provisions for funding these acquisitions.\n","8803:  Example of Land Acquisition from Bas-Saint-Laurent, Quebec In 2010 in the Bas-Saint-Laurent of Quebec, 100 homes were destroyed due to a storm event which eroded seven metres of shoreline.\n","8804:  In response, the Province of Quebec offered to compensate homeowners for relocation, and the properties were then offered for sale to the municipality for $1.00.\n","8805:  The role of the Province in this case allowed the municipality to acquire the land at risk and gain control of it to prevent future development.\n","8806:  Advantages Disadvantages An important tool for implementing linear protection measures (e.g.\n","8807:  dikes) where existing land ownership boundaries do not allow a cost effective configuration for shoreline management.\n","8808:  Land purchase may be used in combination with other tools to reduce the cost of flood protection (e.g., dike vs. seawall).\n","8809:  This will require a comparative analysis of options that includes the cost of land and structural tools.\n","8810:  Where necessary, expropriation enables property acquisition if a voluntary purchase is not possible.\n","8811:  Land purchase may also be the preferred outcome of a cost-benefit analysis where other options are more expensive.\n","8812:  Land purchase can be a key element in a managed retreat strategy.\n","8813:  This tool is primarily used to protect urban development and may include the high costs of acquiring and demolishing existing building improvements.\n","8814:  Land acquisition involves the use of scarce financial resources.\n","8815:  Both local and senior governments may be reluctant to set aside funds for land acquisition unless this is part of a capital improvement project.\n","8816:  Expropriation has the disadvantage that price is not controlled by the acquiring agency.\n","8817:  Expropriation is typically seen as an option of last resort and is not typically viewed favourably by the general public or land owners.\n","8818:  The availability of land offered for public acquisition often has a short window of opportunity following the decision of an owner to sell the land or the death of an owner.\n","8819:  Transfer of Development Potential Tool Description This tool refers to the transfer of a property_s development potential under current zoning provisions from one site or property to another.\n","8820:  If a parcel is considered at risk, the _as of right_ development potential can be relocated to another area of land or parcel not at risk.\n","8821:  Density transfer is primarily a voluntary, market-based concept in which the transfer of development potential offers protection for sensitive coastal resources and removes it from hazard areas.\n","8822:  The tool can direct development away from the area at risk by designating the _donor_ or _sending_ area and allocating it to an appropriate _receiving_ area where development or increased density can be safely accommodated.\n","8823:  51 Land Use Change or Restriction Tools Application This tool is utilized in association with zoning where the development potential is measurable (e.g.\n","8824:  the number of dwellings units or floor space ratio).\n","8825:  Density transfer could apply to any land use but is typically applied to residential uses.\n","8826:  The development potential of the _sending_ site is reduced and the density of the _receiving_ site is increased.\n","8827:  An Official Community Plan or other similar policy document is needed to determine both areas at risk and areas where additional density is deemed suitable.\n","8828:  Density transfer may be achieved using a _density bank_ in which a specific density is removed from the _sending_ site without the need to identify a _receiving_ site.\n","8829:  Density transfer relies on an administrative process to regulate exchanges and a market to determine value.\n","8830:  Density transfer could be applied in any municipality and would be best used in conjunction with a strategic plan where managed retreat is an objective.\n","8831:  Enabling Legislation The transfer of development potential can occur within the normal powers of zoning.\n","8832:  Its application in Canada has mainly been for heritage conservation purposes but it could be used as a tool for adaptation to sea level rise.\n","8833:  Evaluation and Governance Considerations Economic _ This tool essentially assigns an economic value to a property_s development potential.\n","8834:  The development potential of areas at risk are then restricted and the value transferred to areas suitable for increased density.\n","8835:  A market-based mechanism is used to determine the value of the density transfer.\n","8836:  Environmental _ The successful implementation of this tool could protect sensitive coastal areas at risk from development activity.\n","8837:  Limited development could lead to the expansion of environmentally sensitive habitat, allowing intertidal habitats to expand where otherwise they might be reduced due to coastal squeeze.\n","8838:  Social _ The primary use of this tool would be to reduce the development or redevelopment potential of land in areas at risk due to sea level rise.\n","8839:  Implementation Measures and Challenges Implementation requires both an administrative process and a market that provides an incentive to developers.\n","8840:  Although largely a market-based tool, it requires organization and administrative support from the local government.\n","8841:  Transfer of development potential has received considerable interest in planning literature, particularly in the U.S.A. where the concept is referred to as _transfer of development rights._ However, the successful implementation of the concept has been very limited, as it poses challenges in terms of equity and administration for owners of both donor and receiving sites and does not have particularly wide appeal to property developers.\n","8842:  As an example, the City of Vancouver used a density transfer system for many years to encourage heritage conservation; however, this has resulted in more density _in the bank_ than could be used, leading to a moratorium on density banking.\n","8843:  52 Land Use Change or Restriction Tools Advantages Disadvantages Although not currently widely used, this tool is within a local government_s zoning authority.\n","8844:  This tool is market-based and could be structured so local government requirements are limited to administrative costs.\n","8845:  Transfer of density potential could be combined with land acquisition in which the local government acquires ownership of the land and transfers the development potential to the former owner elsewhere in the same municipality.\n","8846:  Density transfer may provide a less costly alternative to land acquisition (whether voluntary or through expropriation).\n","8847:  This tool depends upon the assumption that every parcel of land has development potential that can be quantified and transferred to an alternative location.\n","8848:  Density transfer has limited potential for small communities or ones with a static or declining population.\n","8849:  Owners of coastal properties may resent land use restrictions or _down-zoning_ if they perceive no imminent risk.\n","8850:  As a voluntary undertaking, the transfer of development potential may not prevent the development of areas at risk from coastal hazards.\n","8851:  Easements and Covenants Tool Description An easement is a legal agreement in which one landowner grants the use of some real property rights to another for a specific purpose.\n","8852:  It represents an interest in land but not the right of exclusive possession.\n","8853:  It can be used to allow access over, use of or other limitation that benefits one piece of land (known as the dominant tenement) and burdens another (known as the servient tenement) without resulting in a change of ownership.\n","8854:  In B.C., a statutory right-of-way is similar to an easement.\n","8855:  variation is used to avoid the need for two properties, one with a dominant and the other with a servient tenement.\n","8856:  The use of a statutory right of way is restricted to a government body, Crown Corporation or similar entity.\n","8857:  Both covenants and easements _run with the land_, meaning they bind current as well as future owners.88 A covenant can be used to restrict the use of land for a particular purpose.\n","8858:  and P.E.I., a covenant can also be of a positive or negative nature requiring an undertaking by a landowner.\n","8859:  Examples of positive undertakings would be requirements to plant trees or to maintain privately owned flood protection works.\n","8860:  Restrictive or negative requirements would include a limitation on development for flood protection purposes or prevention of the use of fill.\n","8861:  In Quebec, the Civil Code of Quebec makes provision for servitudes.\n","8862:  A servitude is a charge on one parcel of land for the benefit of another.\n","8863:  A servitude closely corresponds to an easement.\n","8864:  Each of these legal instruments can be used to restrict part or all of a property for a particular purpose without the need for a change of ownership.89 Application An easement, covenant, right-of-way or servitude can be registered on the title of any piece of property; however, the agreement of the property owner is required.\n","8865:  Easements are commonly used to provide the right of access through a property.\n","8866:  A statutory right-of-way is similar but involves a public body.\n","8867:  Both typically involve a legal survey or explanatory plan registered as a charge on the property title.\n","8868:  A covenant is a written agreement between two or more parties to limit the use of the land in a particular way or require the land be used in a particular way.\n","8869:  For an easement, statutory right-of-way or covenant to be enforceable, a purchaser of property must be given notification of its existence.\n","8870:  The purchaser is (Richardson and Otero 2012) 88 89 For a more detailed discussion, see

Restriction Tools deemed to have notice if the legal instrument is registered on the certificate of title of the property in the applicable provincial land registry.\n","8873:  It remains on the land and is automatically transferred from one owner to another if the land is sold.\n","8874:  Enabling Legislation In common law jurisdictions in Canada (every province but Quebec), easements and covenants are authorized by either common law or statute.\n","8875:  In Quebec, the Civil Code of Quebec makes provision for servitudes.90 In B.C., an easement, statutory right-of-way and/or covenant may be registered as a charge on the title of land under Division 4 (S.218-223) of the Land Title Act.\n","8876:  These tools can have broad applications in addressing coastal hazards.\n","8877:  For example a covenant can include provisions restricting the use of land or provisions limiting or preventing building on the land, or preventing its subdivision.\n","8878:  The Act specifies that such a covenant may be of a negative or positive nature and may include a provision that land be protected, preserved, conserved, maintained, enhanced, restored or kept in its natural or existing state in accordance with the covenant and to the extent provided in the covenant.\n","8879:  In Quebec the Natural Heritage Conservation Act allows the registration of a nature reserve agreement to be registered against a land title.\n","8880:  More specifically, the purpose of this Act is to contribute to the objective of safeguarding the character, diversity and integrity of Quebec_s natural heritage through measures intended to protect its biological diversity and the life-sustaining elements of natural settings.\n","8881:  The Act is intended to facilitate the establishment of a network of protected areas representative of biodiversity by introducing protection measures for natural settings that complete existing measures, including the assigning of protection status to certain areas under the responsibility of other government departments or bodies.\n","8882:  In New Brunswick, under the Conservation Easements Act, a municipality or any agency of a municipality may hold a conservation easement for a variety of reasons such as: the protection, enhancement or restoration of natural ecosystems; the conservation or protection of soil, air, land or water; the protection or use of land for outdoor recreation; or the use of land for public education.\n","8883:  Nova Scotia follows the 2001 Conservation Easement Act which enables a conservation easement to be entered into between an owner and an eligible body for the purpose of protecting, restoring or enhancing land that: contains natural ecosystems or constitutes the habitat of rare, threatened or endangered plant or animal species; provides a haven for concentrations of birds and animals; provides opportunities for scientific or educational programs in aspects of the natural environment; or is representative of the ecosystems, landforms or landscapes of the province.\n","8884:  The Natural Areas Protection Act of P.E.I.\n","8885:  is intended to preserve natural areas.\n","8886:  Under this Act, a private landowner may impose a restrictive covenant on his or her land by entering into an agreement with a covenant holder.\n","8887:  Such a restrictive covenant may be positive or negative in nature and prohibit specific uses of the land.\n","8888:  _Natural areas_ are defined by the Act and include parcels of land that: provide haven for seasonal concentrations of birds and animals; or provide opportunities for scientific and educational programs in aspects of the natural environment.\n","8889:  Newfoundland and Labrador has no specific conservation easement legislation.\n","8890:  However, the Historic Resources Act authorizes covenants or easements for the protection of historic resources.\n","8891:  The Act_s definition of _historic resources_ is broad enough to cover some lands with conservation values.91 The Act defines _historic resources_ as a work of nature or of humans that is primarily of value for its archaeological, prehistoric, historic, cultural, natural, scientific or aesthetic interest, including an archaeological, prehistoric, historic or natural site, structure or object.\n","8892:  90 91 (Atkins, Hillyer and Kwasniak 2004) (Atkins, Hillyer and Kwasniak 2004) 54

buildings.\n","8893:  A Save Harmless provision in a covenant can be used to protect a local government from financial damages in the event of future flooding.\n","8894:  The cost of an easement or statutory right-of-way will vary depending on the applicable conditions _ an appraisal is frequently used to determine fair market value.\n","8895:  Compensation to the owner could be through a lump sum or an annual payment based on a percentage of market value.\n","8896:  A local government may be able to issue a tax receipt for a conservation easement if it is classified as a charitable gift by the Canada Revenue Agency.\n","8897:  Environmental _ This tool is well suited to conservation purposes.\n","8898:  Part or all of the land may be restricted for habitat conservation and a covenant may also be used as means of requiring an undertaking for environment enhancement purposes.\n","8899:  Social _ Using this tool provides an alternative to land acquisition that meets the needs both of the landowner and the local government.\n","8900:  This could include limited development or no development on land subject to coastal hazards, but not necessarily restriction of the whole parcel.\n","8901:  This tool offers flexibility without a change in ownership or subdivision.\n","8903:  Challenges may include securing an agreement with the land owner as to the nature, value and funding of the restriction.\n","8904:  Advantages Disadvantages Annual compensation or a lump sum payment may be required to secure the easement or statutory right of way process or servitude.\n","8905:  The easement or other restriction can be limited to a particular part of a site, a particular purpose or a specific time period.\n","8906:  The owner is able to retain ownership of the property and may be able to use areas not at risk.\n","8907:  The cost for a covenant or statutory right-of-way is typically much less than fee simple acquisition.\n","8908:  A covenant may be used in conjunction with other tools such as subdivision, building or land use regulation.\n","8909:  A conservation easement may be considered a charitable gift by the Canada Revenue Agency.\n","8910:  A covenant may be negotiated as part of the development approval process with no direct cost to the local government.\n","8911:  Land Trusts Tool Description A land trust is a non-profit private organization created for the purpose of environmental conservation or other similar purpose.\n","8912:  While there are many land trust organizations in Canada, their general objective is to acquire ecologically significant, often threatened, land through purchase, donation, covenant or lease.\n","8916:  Application Land trusts work with individual donors, foundations, corporations, and all levels of government to acquire and maintain land for environmental conservation purposes.\n","8917:  Land trusts may work in a variety of ways to address their individual mandates; these can include accepting gifts of land from private donors, undertaking fundraising to acquire land to prevent the loss of environmentally significant values, and managing land in public ownership to protect and enhance its habitat and other environmental characteristics.\n","8918:  A conservation agreement is central to land trusts.\n","8919:  While this does not specifically refer to adaptation to sea level rise, the conservation objectives of existing land trusts can easily accommodate this aspect, particularly with habitat creation or enhancements such as coastal wetland and sand dune creation, or rehabilitation.\n","8920:  Englishman River Estuary on Vancouver Island, B.C.\n","8921:  76.7 Hectare Acquisition by the Nature Trust of B.C.\n","8922:  (Photo: Nature Trust of

organization.\n","8924:  Local government could facilitate involvement of a land trust without necessarily expending financial resources and achieve the objective of protecting people from coastal hazards.\n","8925:  Environmental _ This tool is well suited to acquire and protect environmentally sensitive land without local government having to take on responsibility for the land itself.\n","8926:  Social _ This tool can either restrict or enhance public access to environmentally sensitive land or habitat rehabilitation areas.\n","8927:  In addition, this tool potentially has wider appeal for application by those wishing to conserve environmentally sensitive areas in perpetuity.\n","8928:  Implementation Measures and Challenges The implementation of this tool can include acquiring land by a land trust through fundraising, eco-gift, or government transfer, preparing a conservation agreement, and undertaking the necessary restoration and maintenance of the land once an easement, covenant or other restriction is in place.\n","8930:  Time constraints may also apply.\n","8931:  56 Land Use Change or Restriction Tools Advantages Disadvantages The cost of land acquisition may limit the ability of a land trust to secure and restore environmentally significant land.\n","8932:  The appeal of land acquisitions varies greatly depending on the type of environmentally significant land and the cost of maintaining or restoring the land.\n","8933:  Land trusts are primarily used for environmental protection and enhancement.\n","8936:  Fundraising for privately managed land acquisition by a land trust offers opportunities that may not be available if government is involved.\n","8937:  Local governments can work collaboratively with land trusts to identify areas that may be suited to environmental protection and play a facilitation role but leave the negotiation with the land owner up to the trust.\n","8938:  Foreshore Tenure Tool Description A foreshore tenure is a legal instrument that authorizes a use or uses over intertidal and subtidal areas.\n","8939:  This may include a lease or licence of occupation.\n","8940:  In B.C., the foreshore generally refers to the area below the natural boundary.92 In Atlantic Canada, the foreshore refers to the area below the high water mark.\n","8941:  A foreshore tenure by itself will not provide protection from coastal hazards.\n","8942:  However, it may, in conjunction with zoning, provide the mechanism to enable a more comprehensive approach to shoreline management.\n","8943:  Application A foreshore tenure could be applied to almost all of Canada_s southern coasts.\n","8944:  Foreshore tenure is generally granted by the applicable provincial government, although there are some exceptions, most notably with respect to harbours established under the Canadian Marine Act.\n","8945:  Foreshore tenure does not affect the underlying Crown ownership of land (including land under water) but it can be used by a local government as part of a comprehensive approach to shoreline management such as beach nourishment, sand dune or coastal wetland creation and/or rehabilitation as well as hard structural protection.\n","8946:  A foreshore lease is one form of tenure.\n","8947:  foreshore leases require a legal survey to define the tenure area and are typically issued for periods of 10 to 30 years.\n","8948:  The term _water lot_ is frequently used as an alternative.\n","8949:  If the lease is surveyed and has a term of 5 or more years, it can be registered in the Land Title Office.\n","8950:  A licence of occupation may be used if the term is short, where minimal improvements are proposed or for remote sites where survey costs may be prohibitive.\n","8951:  A statutory right of way may also be used to accommodate a linear corridor within a foreshore area.\n","8952:  The issuance of a foreshore lease is typically by application to the provincial government or another agency with jurisdiction.\n","8953:  The interests of riparian owners and First Nations must usually be considered and the lease must be consistent with zoning by local government or other applicable authorities.\n","8954:  In a few instances, a municipality has partnered with the Crown to take over the administration and management of foreshore areas.\n","8955:  An example is a head lease.\n","8956:  Under this arrangement, the municipality is granted long-term tenure over a foreshore area with a revenue-sharing arrangement with the Crown.\n","8957:  In 92 In B.C., the _natural boundary_ is defined in the Land Act as, _the visible high water mark of any lake, river, stream or other body of water where the presence and action of the water are so common and usual, and so long continued in all ordinary years, as to mark on the soil of the bed of the body of water a character distinct from that of its banks, in vegetation, as well as in the nature of the soil itself._ 57 Land Use Change or Restriction Tools return the head lease transfers responsibility for management and environment issues to the municipality.\n","8958:  Head leases are not commonly issued to municipalities unless there is demonstrated business case with a high benefit to the Province.\n","8959:  Example of Foreshore Tenure from West Vancouver head lease, B.C.\n","8960:  Since 1974, the District of West Vancouver has held a head lease with the Province of B.C.\n","8961:  for the management of land covered by water from the high water mark extending 1,000 m into Burrard

partnership, a new 30 year head lease will commence in 2014.\n","8965:  The lease covers any community purposes under the Community and Institutional Crown land policy.\n","8966:  This includes public access infrastructure such as walkways, seawalls, boat ramps, piers, wharves, and five marinas.\n","8967:  Utility works are included, as well as natural enhancements such as groynes, rock reefs and riprap.\n","8968:  The lease authorizes subleases and includes a revenue sharing agreement with the Province of B.C., while the District of West Vancouver assumes management responsibility and liability under the head lease.\n","8969:  The head lease is subject to the rights of riparian owners or occupiers of adjoining land.\n","8970:  The District also has adopted Official Community Plan policies to protect the foreshore and a 5 year foreshore protection plan.\n","8971:  A number of enhancement works are currently underway with the active support of affected riparian owners.\n","8972:  Enabling Legislation In B.C.\n","8973:  foreshore leases and licences of occupation are typically granted by the Province under the Land Act.\n","8974:  The Local Government Act provides for local government regulation over the surface of the foreshore area through Official Community Plans and zoning authority.\n","8975:  The province of Nova Scotia has a Beaches and Foreshores Act which allows for grants or leases of any tidal flat, beach or foreshore.\n","8976:  Department of Natural Resources issues leases on submerged crown lands for commercial purposes such as wharves, marinas, power generation, utility cables, etc.\n","8977:  In Newfoundland and Labrador, the Lands Act, Section 7, provides for a reservation of shoreline on Crown lands that border a lake, pond, river, the seashore or foreshore, and that are granted, leased or licensed to another party, that a 15 metre wide strip of land is maintained as a reserve by the province.\n","8978:  The Lands Act of Newfoundland and Labrador also gives authority to the provincial government to issue leases on foreshore areas for aquaculture licensing.\n","8979:  On P.E.I., water lots in waterfront areas can be privately owned.\n","8980:  The Department of Fisheries and Oceans administers the licensing and leasing of aquaculture operations via the Fisheries Act.\n","8981:  The infilling of harbours, such as a project in Summerside in 2002, requires federal approval under subsection 35 of the Federal Fisheries Act.\n","8982:  New Brunswick has had the authority under Common Law to issue foreshore leases or grants for oyster fishing, for up to a 10 year period, since 1866.\n","8983:  58 Land Use Change or Restriction Tools West Vancouver, B.C.\n","8984:  Seawall Evaluation and Governance Considerations Economic _ In B.C., the cost of a foreshore lease is set by the Province.\n","8985:  The assessed or market value of a lease may be set at a percentage of the land value, for example 8% annually.\n","8986:  Nominal rent tenure applies if the lease qualifies under the Community and Institutional Land Use Policy of the Ministry of Forests, Lands, and Natural Resource Operations.\n","8987:  This policy applies to eligible public sector organizations, local governments, First Nations and community organizations.\n","8988:  Environmental _ A foreshore lease allows the management of the foreshore to be treated as more of a complete system rather than stopping at the traditional jurisdictional boundary of the high tide mark or natural boundary.\n","8989:  This can facilitate implementation of innovative soft armoring approaches such as habitat enhancement of intertidal areas, beach nourishment or the creation of wetlands.\n","8990:  the holder of a foreshore tenure is responsible for clean-up of any contamination that occurs within the tenure boundaries.\n","8991:  Social _ Local governance tenure over the foreshore can allow for partnerships with riparian owners and local community groups to provide protection for upland areas or intertidal habitats.\n","8992:  This can help foster a sense of ownership and responsibility at the community level for adaptation along the coast.\n","8993:  Increased recreational use may provide an additional indirect benefit.\n","8994:  Implementation Measures and Challenges In British Columbia, foreshore leases have typically been used for marine facilities associated with upland development.\n","8995:  One challenge will be to refocus this tool as part of a sea level rise adaptation strategy.\n","8996:  In addition, it must be recognized that this tool will have limited suitability due to environmental, bathymetric and other constraints.\n","8997:  The District of West Vancouver provides an excellent model for foreshore management.\n","8998:  The District has worked in co-operation with upland owners and has not detrimentally affected fish habitat.\n","8999:  In addition, foreshore leases do not affect any federally controlled waterways such as shipping channels for the Port of Vancouver or BC Ferries routes.\n","9000:  59 Land Use Change or Restriction Tools Advantages Disadvantages Foreshore tenure could enable a local government to undertake a broader range of shoreline management and adaptation measures in response to coastal hazards.\n","9001:  A foreshore lease (or other form of tenure) could enable environmental enhancement to occur with less reliance on structural protection.\n","9003:  A foreshore lease does not absolve the holder of any responsibility under the Fisheries Act or Navigable Waters Protection Act.\n","9004:  There will be costs associated with a foreshore lease, which could range from a nominal cost to fair market value (prepaid or annual lease payment).\n","9005:  The applicability of this tool will be limited to areas with suitable shoreline conditions and bathymetry.\n","9006:  60 Land Use Change or Restriction Tools Structural (Flood Protection Works) 1.\n","9007:  Scour Protection Tool Description Scour protection is a property-specific structural tool used to protect shoreline structures or building foundations from being eroded or undermined due to the effects of moving water.\n","9008:  Scour protection consists of riprap or structural elements designed to withstand wave action and the force of moving water.\n","9009:  It can take different forms depending on the application: a scour apron refers to site-specific protection around the base of a building or structure whereas a scour blanket refers to measures to protect a covered or partially covered asset such as a pipeline, outfall or underground utility from damage by floodwater.\n","9010:  Application Scour protection is typically applied to the foundation of a building or structure and is often used in conjunction with structural elevation.\n","9011:  In this case the scour protection would be implemented around the building or structural element foundation.\n","9013:  Scour protection can be an integral part of a shoreline protection system such as armour rock, gabions, concrete slabs, and similar systems.\n","9014:  Evaluation and Governance Considerations Economic _ There are costs associated with erosion protection measures.\n","9015:  A scour apron, typically includes an apron of riprap outside the perimeter wall installed down to the depth of the potential scour around the site.\n","9016:  The surface may include a gravel topping or filter fabric as well as topsoil for landscaping.\n","9017:  Other scour protection may take the form of pile foundations designed to derive vertical and lateral support below the depth of scour.\n","9019:  A scour apron may be used to support retaining walls of linear infrastructure (e.g.\n","9020:  dikes) to ensure the toe of the structure is protected.\n","9021:  For a submerged structure such as a pipeline, a scour blanket typically consists of an armouring of filter stone around the structure and a cover stone above it.\n","9022:  Environmental _ Scour protection primarily addresses the protection of building foundations and linear structure foundations.\n","9023:  Environmental impacts will be limited for buildings, but may increase in magnitude where scour protection is introduced along a linear corridor such a seawall, stormwater outfall or a pipeline crossing.\n","9024:  Intertidal areas are typically associated with high environmental values, and protective measures may result in some reduction or loss of environmental quality.\n","9025:  Social _ This tool is intended to minimize risk to the foundations of buildings and structures.\n","9026:  If the risk to a building is reduced, the risk to inhabitants and employees also decreases.\n","9027:  61 Structural Tools (Flood Protection Works) Implementation Measures and Challenges Implementation typically occurs following an engineering analysis of risk and appropriate mitigation measures.\n","9028:  A design drawing is produced, showing the minimum requirements to implement the erosion/scour protection measures.\n","9029:  The contractor or other responsible party then constructs the scour protection according to the specifications provided.\n","9030:  The tool may be implemented in conjunction with other requirements as determined by a building inspector, approving officer or the terms set within a covenant on title.\n","9031:  Challenges can occur if the extent of the risk increases over time or is not known or identified, with the result that scour protection measures are not requested.\n","9032:  If there are no gatekeepers responsible for public protection, the risk to a specific building or infrastructure corridor may be overlooked even if the property owner is conscientious.\n","9033:  In the absence of regulatory requirements or regular inspection, information resources can provide general guidelines alerting a property owner to the benefits of scour protection in areas subject to flooding and sea level rise.\n","9035:  The presence of erosion/scour protection provides two secondary messages: _ a vivid and constant public reminder to passers-by that the site is subject to flooding or inundation risks; and _ a reminder that adaptation measures have taken place.\n","9037:  This can often be mitigated by providing an erodible top to cover the scour protection or provide a more gradual grade away from the building.\n","9038:  Where services are provided to a building, the erosion/ scour protection will only protect services within the scour protection area, not the services beyond.\n","9039:  Costs can be significant and include designing, transporting, installing and maintaining erosion/scour protection.\n","9040:  Structural Elevation Tool Description Structural elevation can be achieved in several ways, including: raising the ground elevation with the placement of structural fill; raising the elevation of habitable areas within a building; or raising the entire building by using stilts, foundation walls or similar elevating structures.\n","9041:  This tool is mainly used for new construction but can also apply to a major addition or retrofit.\n","9042:  This tool is also sometimes referred to as super elevation or dry floodproofing.\n","9043:  Application This tool can reduce the risk of damage to buildings and infrastructure by raising their elevation.\n","9044:  The increase in elevation above the natural ground level can be determined through a risk assessment by a qualified professional or in accordance with local government requirements, guidelines or policy.\n","9045:  In rural areas, this tool typically involves the use of fill to raise the elevation of a house or other buildings above a flood plain or other flood hazard.\n","9046:  In urban areas where lot areas are smaller, this tool may involve creating non-habitable space (crawl space or cellar) in areas subject to flooding.\n","9047:  A combination of fill and building design changes may be used for new development on a neighbourhood level or for infill redevelopment within an existing area.\n","9048:  62 Structural Tools (Flood Protection Works) In B.C., the authority for structural elevation is most clearly stated in Section 910 of the Local Government Act.\n","9049:  If a local government considers that flooding may occur on a piece of land, the local government may adopt a bylaw requiring a minimum elevation for the underside of a floor system of a house on that land.\n","9050:  Such a bylaw must consider the provincial guidelines, which take sea level rise and related impacts into account.\n","9051:  The standard of protection varies from province to province.\n","9052:  In British Columbia, the design standard of protection is for a 1 in 200 year return period.\n","9053:  This means the elevation of buildings should be raised to withstand a flood with an annual probability of 0.5% or a 1 in 200 year flood.\n","9054:  the minimum elevation for habitable construction is called the Flood Construction Level (FCL).\n","9055:  This is the minimum elevation of the underside of a wooden floor system or the top of a concrete slab for habitable buildings.\n","9056:  The Flood Construction Level typically includes an additional vertical distance (freeboard) of 0.3 metres to 0.6 metres to the calculated flood level to accommodate uncertainties in flood levels.\n","9057:  There is a relationship between the standard of protection and resulting risk.\n","9058:  If the design standard is reduced to withstand a flood with an annual probability of 1.0%, the cost of protective measures will decrease but the risk increases.\n","9059:  Flood construction requirements in Atlantic Canada may reference a minimum elevation above sea level datum, geodetic datum or protection for a 1 in 100 year return period or a 50 year design standard.\n","9060:  In Newfoundland and Labrador, the design standard is based on a flood event with a 1 in 100 year return period.\n","9062:  A notable exception is the Confederation Bridge between New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, which was built a metre higher to account for sea level rise over the 100 year design life of the project.\n","9063:  Evaluation and Governance Considerations Economic _ The cost of structural elevation depends on a numbers of factors, one of which is the cost of fill.\n","9064:  The affected site area will include the building footprint area plus a sloped area for the fill, typically at a 3:1 slope, to return to the

Construction Level, the building could be designed without livable space on the ground level.\n","9070:  This often takes the form of a crawl space with a low ceiling height, a garage, an entry foyer, laundry room or a small storage area.\n","9071:  Electrical outlets would have to be raised and a furnace located above the Flood Construction Level.\n","9072:  The key economic consideration is the cost of reducing the risk through structural elevation.\n","9073:  The cost of providing public infrastructure93 (roads, bridges) in an area at risk is another economic consideration that will increase over time.\n","9074:  The cost of floodproofing can also be compared to the cost of development in an area without risk of coastal flooding or inundation.\n","9075:  Environmental _ This tool

Implementation Measures and Challenges Structural elevation measures are typically required as a condition of building approval.\n","9084:  Structural elevation measures can be implemented after a building is constructed but incur greater costs.\n","9086:  A large structural elevation rise on a small property may not be feasible.\n","9087:  The aesthetics of having elevated and non-elevated structures in the same community may be a drawback if the elevation change is significant.\n","9088:  Providing access for persons with disabilities poses an additional challenge.\n","9089:  The structural elevation of heritage buildings also poses a particular challenge.\n","9090:  Advantages Disadvantages By raising the habitable floor elevation to a specified design flood event, the risk of flood damage can be measurably reduced.\n","9091:  Structural elevation enhances resilience by providing a secondary means of protection where dikes provide the first line of defence.\n","9092:  One indirect impact of structural elevation is greater awareness of sea level rise.\n","9093:  Although architectural design can address visual impact to some extent, a major change in elevation for a dwelling or other habitable structure serves as a vivid and constant public reminder that flooding is a risk that must be addressed.\n","9094:  Structural elevation is not a permanent solution, as sea levels will continue to rise, but may last the lifetime of the building.\n","9095:  The cost associated with raising the elevation of a building can be considerable.\n","9096:  The cost will vary depending on the size of the building floor plate, the building design and the amount of elevation rise to reach the design requirements.\n","9097:  Estimated additional building costs for new construction may range from 3% to 30%.\n","9098:  Associated costs may include additional steps or handicapped accessibility provisions.\n","9099:  There is a limit to the amount of structural elevation which can occur.\n","9100:  As structural elevation requirements increase (i.e., become higher), the increase in cost is geometric, not arithmetic.\n","9101:  The placement of fill to raise the ground level may not be aesthetically attractive if the elevation change is large.\n","9102:  This is particularly evident on small infill lots.\n","9103:  Dikes Tool Description A dike is commonly a linear compacted earthfill structure intended to protect a designated area from inundation caused by high water conditions on an adjacent watercourse or floodplain.94 Dikes typically form the key defense element in a protect strategy.\n","9104:  The primary function of a dike is to prevent the inundation of coastal lowlands from the sea under extreme conditions.\n","9105:  Sea dikes typically have a flatter gradient on the seaward side, for the purpose of dissipating wave energy.\n","9106:  This is not necessary on the landward side where a steeper gradient is typical to reduce land requirements.\n","9107:  In addition, a sea dike will typically have toe scour protection consisting of riprap and an under layer of filter rock or geotextile to prevent it from being undermined.\n","9108:  94 (APEG Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of BC 2012) 64 Structural Tools (Flood Protection Works) It is important to recognize that, because agricultural land can

province.\n","9128:  The Department is currently responsible for tidal dike maintenance, while landowners are responsible for maintenance of internal dike roads and the acquisition of land required for the reconstruction of dikes.\n","9129:  Historically, earthen dikes have been used to protect this land.\n","9130:  These dikes have been raised to maintain a minimum critical elevation relative to tide levels.\n","9131:  Many dikes were originally built by the Acadians 300 years ago and were upgraded in the 1950s.\n","9132:  In 2000, the provincial Agricultural Marshland Conservation Act was passed to protect these soils for future generations.\n","9133:  It is thought that a majority of the diked land is at risk from rising sea levels and storm surge.97 Under a joint Atlantic Regional Adaptation Collaboration project with New Brunswick, a 2012 GIS assessment of dike vulnerability based on LiDAR data in the Tantramar marshlands area concluded that the region was at immediate risk of flooding.98 With an average height of 8.9 metres, the vast majority of dikes (89%) would be overtopped with a frequency of 1:10 years (i.e.\n","9134:  once in 10 years).\n","9135:  This would potentially flood over 20% of Sackville during a storm surge.\n","9136:  Evaluation and Governance Considerations Economic _ Economic considerations include: _ The cost of new dike construction where a dike is not present; _ The cost to accommodate a higher dike due to sea level rise; _ The structural stability of the new dike; and _ The ongoing cost of dike maintenance; and land acquisition to accommodate the land base for the dike and road access for maintenance and emergency management purposes.\n","9137:  Where an increased dike height is involved, the economic, social and environmental implications of a seaward versus a landward expansion must be examined.\n","9139:  The standard for flood protection measures (i.e., Flood Construction Level for current sea level vs. projections for 2050 or 2100) will have a critical impact on the economic costs.\n","9140:  Given the cost implications, it is anticipated that greater use of hybrid techniques such as living shorelines will occur and increased attention will be given to retreat and avoid strategies.\n","9141:  The capital and operating costs of dikes may limit their implementation to selected locations, such as densely populated areas, areas with high natural or cultural importance, and high value infrastructure.\n","9142:  Funding for dike upgrades requires a large capital outlay, and requires approval by different levels of government.\n","9143:  Intermittent funding programs may not be appropriate where the need for upgrades is ongoing and long-term.\n","9144:  It may be difficult to obtain public acceptance depending on the capital costs and the distribution of those costs, especially if property views are impacted.\n","9145:  97 Refers to an extreme tide which occurs every 18.03 years in the Gulf of

some 250 km of shoreline and dikes in total.\n","9151:  Within this area both diked shorelines and low-lying areas that may require protection as sea level rises were considered.\n","9152:  The report calculated the full costs of establishing flood protection for seismic stabilization of the diking system and the sea level rise projected to take place by 2100, including land acquisition, engineering, environmental design, relocation of utilities, and upgrading of pump stations and other associated works.\n","9153:  The total estimated cost was $9,470 million, including a 50% contingency factor.\n","9154:  The estimated cost for sea level rise alone, including associated infrastructure and property acquisition was $2,810 million.\n","9156:  The presence of dikes impedes natural shoreline migration _ an adaptive response of coastal habitats to rising sea levels.\n","9159:  Unless such structures are designed to meet a long-range design standard, they can lead to a false sense of security.\n","9160:  If Flood Construction Levels and setbacks are not increased due to sea level rise and other climate change effects, the level of protection provided by a dike will gradually decrease over time.\n","9162:  Dikes can also provide a secure corridor, such as a road or trail, and often enhance recreation value.\n","9163:  Implementation Measures and Challenges Apart from the high costs for construction, dike implementation measures require land acquisition for the linear corridor occupied by the dike as well as access for maintenance and emergency measures.\n","9164:  The linear corridor may affect numerous landowners and may require the relocation or removal of other structures.\n","9166:  99 (Ausenco Sandwell 2011) 67 Structural Tools (Flood

restrict access to the shore and reduce the recreational value of a shoreline.\n","9173:  Dikes may cause erosion to adjacent unprotected areas.\n","9175:  Dikes can result in a loss of intertidal areas and impede natural shoreline migration.\n","9176:  Tool Description There are several types of other hard protection structures commonly used within a coastal context.\n","9178:  They are located perpendicular to the shore or at a slightly oblique angle.\n","9179:  Groynes are used to dissipate wave energy, trap the movement of sediment along an intertidal area and reduce the seaward transport of sediment (this may cause erosion on one side and accretion on the other).\n","9180:  They function by realigning short sections of the shore with respect to the incoming waves.\n","9182:  A perched beach retained by a submerged structure may be considered a subset of this category.\n","9183:  Offshore breakwaters may also be called bulkheads.\n","9184:  They are designed to reduce the intensity of wave action in inshore waters and thereby reduce coastal erosion or provide safe harborage.\n","9185:  Breakwaters may also be small structures placed offshore in relatively shallow water designed to protect a gently sloping beach or a vertical retaining wall designed to hold and prevent soil from sliding seaward.\n","9187:  Seawalls are built parallel to the shore and generally have a

seawalls and revetments can, on occasion, be used interchangeably.\n","9193:  Storm Surge and Tidal Barriers consist of hard engineered protection with movable or fixed barriers/gates which are closed to prevent flooding when extreme water levels are forecast.\n","9194:  Application Groynes are typically used to impede the drift of sediment along a beach.\n","9195:  Their effectiveness depends upon a supply of sand and the existence of longshore sediment transport.\n","9196:  They are often constructed as a series of structures and may be used in combination with beach nourishment.\n","9197:  Breakwaters are used to protect marinas, ports, harbours and other shoreline infrastructure from storm surges and wave action.\n","9198:  Seawalls are most often used to dissipate wave energy, as well as flooding and erosion in constrained coastal areas.\n","9199:  This may occur where the land drops off sharply on the seaward side or where the cost of land acquisition for a dike is prohibitive.\n","9200:  A seawall provides a firm boundary between the land and the sea and provides protection up to the design height of the seawall.\n","9202:  Floodwalls are typically used in locations where space is limited and where land uses and values are very high.\n","9203:  Floodwalls are used where the use of a dike or other lesser cost structure is precluded, due to conflicts with buildings and other land uses.\n","9204:  Storm Surge Barriers are constructed across river estuaries and are equipped with gates that can be closed in the event of a storm surge.100 They are most commonly used to protect tidal inlets and estuaries.\n","9205:  Their primary function is to prevent coastal flooding, but they can shorten the length of defences behind the barrier.\n","9206:  Water

measures are similar to those of dikes.\n","9208:  Groynes, breakwaters and storm surge barriers also involve high construction costs.\n","9209:  For all hard protection, an engineering analysis should be undertaken with respect to capital and operating costs as well as risk and impact mitigation.\n","9211:  Groynes, breakwaters and storm surge barriers may cause negative environmental impacts and transfer risk onto nearby properties.\n","9213:  Implementation Measures and Challenges Implementation of any form of hard protection will, in most cases, involve large costs and funding.\n","9214:  Apart from the construction costs implementation of hard protection measures may require land acquisition and authorized access to undertake maintenance and emergency measures.\n","9215:  A particular challenge affecting the implementation of a groyne is the potential to transfer risk from one riparian property to another or create a negative economic, social or environmental impact.\n","9216:  Example: Sept-_les, qC hard protection challenges In the municipality of Sept-_les in Quebec, measures to protect against erosion have primarily involved riprap structures constructed and paid for by the municipality, sometimes with assistance from the Province or private property owners.\n","9217:  Property owners require a permit before such measures can be implemented, however, many have built riprap structures without permits over the years.\n","9218:  The result is a patch-work mix of varying quality and integrity.\n","9219:  The riprap installed in the bay to protect the downtown core from flooding has held up well over the years and appears to be doing its job.\n","9220:  The bay is relatively protected from winds; some waves do not hit the rocks with as much force as in other areas.\n","9221:  It has been observed in the areas that extend out from the bay that riprap structures appear to have contributed to increasing erosion particularly in the gap areas where the structures are not as well constructed or are absent.\n","9222:  For this reason, in 2000, municipal officials requested that the province conduct detailed research on erosion in the area.\n","9223:  As a result of this research, all structural measures, save for adding sand to the banks, have been prohibited since 2005.\n","9224:  70 Structural Tools (Flood Protection Works) Advantages Disadvantages Many forms of hard structural protection can be engineered to provide a reasonably high level of dependability, if adequately maintained.\n","9225:  Hard structural protection can provide protection for high value development or natural areas and maintain or increase property values.\n","9226:  A seawall may be available for use as a recreation corridor.\n","9227:  The Stanley Park seawall in Vancouver is an example of an outstanding success with major recreation and economic spin-off benefits.\n","9228:  Structural measures to protect against erosion in one place can increase erosion elsewhere.\n","9229:  This situation may occur where incoming waves approach the shoreline at an angle causing sediment to move along the shoreline until blocked by a groyne.\n","9230:  A groyne offers limited protection against extreme events and may negatively impact adjacent riparian areas.\n","9231:  A seawall or floodwall reflects more wave energy, which may cause localized erosion at the toe and require a deep foundation.\n","9232:  Seawalls and other hard protection structures are expensive to construct and maintain, can be unsightly and restrict shore access.\n","9233:  Wet Floodproofing Tool Description Wet floodproofing consists of measures which allow water to enter and exit a structure with minimal damage.\n","9234:  Wet floodproofing involves the use of flood resistant materials, the elevation of electrical and mechanical services and the use of openings for drainage.\n","9235:  This tool is distinguished from dry floodproofing which aims to make a building watertight or impermeable to an expected flood.\n","9236:  Application Wet floodproofing has limited applicability and is not commonly used.\n","9237:  It may be used for existing developments with small land parcels built where infrastructure is slightly below the established Flood Construction Level.\n","9238:  A commercial storefront abutting a sidewalk that is at an elevation subject to flooding has few alternatives if the building has no setback from the property line.\n","9239:  Wet floodproofing may be a viable alternative to elevating an existing residential property on a small lot above the floodplain.\n","9240:  Wet floodproofing may be used where the area subject to flooding is not used for habitable purposes, these may include

equipment.\n","9249:  A detailed list of flood-resistant materials and their application has been published by the US Federal Emergency Management Agency based on destructive testing by the US Army Corps of Engineers.\n","9251:  Advantages Disadvantages Can reduce the time and cost of cleanup after a flood.\n","9252:  Wet floodproofing can be less costly than other retrofits as no additional land is required and the appearance of the building is minimally affected.\n","9253:  Allowing water to enter and exit a building may be a cost-effective alternative to dry floodproofing.\n","9254:  A wide range of water resistant materials can be used at a reasonable cost.\n","9255:  Wet floodproofing has limited applicability and appeal for sea level rise.\n","9256:  Clean-up is still required

both upland and aquatic characteristics.\n","9262:  As a result, they are extremely productive ecosystems and often have a richer flora and fauna than other environments.102 Functionally, coastal wetlands assist with wave and tidal dissipation, and their vegetation and root systems act as a trap for sediments, facilitating accretion and reducing erosion.\n","9263:  In the absence of a barrier to migration, if a wetland or salt marsh is losing area on its seaward side, it is likely claiming area on its landward side.\n","9264:  This adaptive ability contrasts sharply with traditional human-made coastal defences that are static and typically require the continuous input of resources.103 The most commonly restored coastal wetland ecosystems are salt marshes.\n","9265:  Application On the seaward side, this tool can be used as part of a protect or accommodate strategy.\n","9266:  On the landward side, wetland creation can be part of an avoid strategy or provide a transitional

the more beach (or similar surface), the more energy is dissipated.\n","9339:  By adding a sediment supply, the beach is maintained at a width that provides storm protection and acts as a buffer.\n","9340:  The cross-sectional shape of a beach affects its ability to dissipate wave energy: a wide and shallow beach will attenuate wave energy more effectively than a steep and narrow beach.\n","9341:  Beach nourishment reduces the detrimental effects of coastal erosion by providing additional sediment to satisfy the natural forces of erosion.\n","9342:  Beach nourishment will not stop erosion; however, it will provide a sacrificial element against coastal erosion, rather than a hard barrier.\n","9343:  Beach nourishment will likely be required on an ongoing basis as long as the forces of erosion are present.108 Application Beach nourishment can use sediment material dredged from the ocean, or material barged, trucked, moved by heavy equipment or by a conveyor belt from a land-based source.\n","9344:  The rate of erosion needs to be monitored on a regular basis, typically by a cross-sectional analysis.\n","9345:  If the available beach material drops below to a critical level, re-nourishment will be required to avoid further erosion and damage to coastal infrastructure.\n","9346:  A sediment budget is used to describe the measurement of migrating and eroding sediment in a manner similar to the measurement of river bed aggradation.\n","9347:  Because of annual sand erosion from the dunes and beaches in the area, a beach nourishment program has been in place at Parlee Beach (near Shediac, N.B.)\n","9348:  It is expected that this will become an annual program with a portion of the park entrance fee ($3) used to help pay for the program.\n","9349:  108 (Linham and Nicholls 2010) 77 Non-Structural Tools (Soft Armouring) Evaluation and Governance Considerations Economic _ Economic considerations include the availability and cost of acquiring, moving and placing sand or other suitable beach material on an eroded shoreline.\n","9350:  The allocation of costs between individual benefiting property owners and the community as a whole may need to be addressed.\n","9351:  Beach nourishment may offer economic benefits as an alternative to or in combination with other forms of structural protection.\n","9352:  Environmental _ Beach nourishment may enhance intertidal areas.\n","9353:  However, negative effects could occur if the material deposited does not match the size and composition of native beach material, if the deposited material provides excessive turbidity or if the depth of material deposited buries existing marine organisms.\n","9355:  Implementation Measures and Challenges Engineering studies over an extended time period are required to determine the rate and extent of shoreline erosion and the volume of beach nourishment required to address the sediment deficit.\n","9356:  For large-scale beach nourishment applications specialized equipment must be used.\n","9357:  Ongoing monitoring will be required to evaluate the success of the beach nourishment and when additional beach nourishment is required.\n","9359:  Advantages Disadvantages Beach nourishment provides sacrificial material to be eroded, effectively protecting landward areas from wave action.\n","9360:  This tool may provide an alternative to the use of hard protection such as groynes which can disrupt natural processes of sediment supply to a beach.\n","9361:  Beach nourishment can enhance the value of beaches by providing a more aesthetically appealing environment.\n","9362:  As sediment is redistributed by the natural forces or erosion, it may also have a positive effect on adjacent areas not directly nourished.\n","9363:  Beach nourishment may address multiple objectives, including environmental enhancement and protection, public and recreational access, and hazard reduction.\n","9364:  The use of beach nourishment is subject to a number of widespread limitations, including a consistent supply of correctly sized sediment for the long-term and a suitable foreshore profile.\n","9365:  Beach nourishment can become prohibitively expensive if a supply of sediment is not readily available.\n","9366:  The value of aggregate resources including sand is highly dependent on the proximity of supply sources to the locations in which they are needed.\n","9367:  Beach nourishment is not a permanent solution to shoreline erosion.\n","9368:  It will require regular monitoring and periodic re-nourishment depending on the rate of erosion that takes place.\n","9369:  Beach nourishment may affect the productivity of intertidal areas.\n","9370:  78 Non-Structural Tools (Soft Armouring) Combinations & Compatibility Combinations & Compatibility The 21 tools in this primer have been organized into five broad categories: planning, regulatory, land use change or restriction, structural and non-structural.\n","9371:  These five categories are intended to assist decision makers in the selection, application and combination of these tools.\n","9373:  At first glance, structural and non-structural adaptation tools may appear to represent opposing approaches;

Island Causeway.\n","9382:  80 The tools in this primer, individually or in combination, may be used to meet the four overall strategies for adaptation to sea level rise.\n","9383:  These strategies are not _pure_ approaches or mutually exclusive; in fact, a local government may undertake different strategies for different areas following an analysis of the varying conditions.\n","9384:  A protect strategy may be suitable for an historic area where all buildings and infrastructure would be frequently inundated without the installation of linear structural protection such as a dike.\n","9385:  An accommodate strategy may apply to a new development at the margins of an area at risk of coastal flooding.\n","9386:  An avoid strategy may be applied to prevent a proposed new residential development or a large commercial or institutional development in a previously undeveloped area at risk of flooding.\n","9387:  Finally, a retreat strategy may be suitable for a rural area where the Flood Construction Level is an entire floor above the ground elevation.\n","9388:  Over time, the choice of strategy for the same area may change due to changing circumstances, risk assessment or availability of resources.\n","9389:  For example, a protect strategy relying on dikes alone may represent the historic approach in a particular area.\n","9390:  With a new risk

stabilization shoreline alternatives, refer to the management of coastal areas in ways that protect, restore, enhance or create natural shoreline habitat.\n","9399:  Living shorelines have typically been designed and implemented using a collaborative approach; working with several levels of government, riparian property owners, nature trust organizations and other stakeholders.\n","9400:  One of the leading proponents of living shorelines is the State of Maryland.\n","9401:  Maryland has over 11,000 kilometres (7,000 miles) of tidal shoreline along Chesapeake Bay and other coastal watersheds.\n","9402:  The state faced an annual loss of over 235 hectares (580 acres) of coastal shoreline and a permitting issue wherein soft armouring was at a major disadvantage compared to structural protection.\n","9403:  Under the Living Shoreline Protection Act of 2008, the State of Maryland adopted non-structural _living shorelines_ erosion control measures as the preferred method to address the impacts of shore erosion induced by sea level rise wherever technologically and ecologically appropriate.\n","9404:  This legislation does not prevent the implementation of hard structural measures, but requires soft or non-structural measures be considered first.\n","9405:  Adoption of the Living Shoreline Protection Act followed more than 20 years of research on the effectiveness of non-structural erosion control in Chesapeake Bay and other sheltered areas.109 In Atlantic Canada, Nova Scotia and P.E.I.\n","9406:  now employ living shorelines approaches.\n","9407:  In B.C., communities on Vancouver Island and on the Sunshine Coast have used living shoreline approaches; on the west coast, living shores approaches are also known as _Green Shores_ projects.\n","9408:  Green Shores Examples from B.C.110 Green Shores is a trademarked program of the Stewardship Centre for British Columbia.\n","9409:  The Green Shores program consists of hybrid techniques that promote the sustainable use of coastal ecosystems through planning and design that recognizes their ecological features and functions.\n","9411:  A key program component is a Coastal Development Rating System intended for use by designers, builders and owners to guide Green Shores design and assess design performance.\n","9412:  110 109 110 (Management, Policy, Science, and Engineering of Nonstructural Erosion Control in the Chesapeake Bay 2006) (Stewardship Centre for British Columbia 2012) 83 Non-Local Government Adaptation Tools Non-Local Government Adaptation Tools Insurance and emergency management are also essential adaptation tools.\n","9413:  Insurance plays almost no role in Canada, but is widely used in other developed countries.\n","9414:  Emergency management is present in all provinces, but responsibility is shared with senior governments.\n","9415:  Insurance Insurance is widely used to encourage sea level rise adaptation in other developed countries with extensive shorelines and coastal areas at risk.\n","9416:  However, it is not currently a tool available to local governments, and its availability in Canada is very limited.111 Insurance premiums are commonly based on estimates of previous losses incurred.\n","9417:  While this approach can discourage asset investment within high-risk hazard areas, it also puts pressure on local, provincial and federal government to provide _protection_ against the hazard.\n","9418:  Flood insurance due to overland flows (such as storm surge or high river levels,) surface water flooding or flooding caused by groundwater is not available to homeowners in any province in Canada, though it is available for commercial development.\n","9419:  A 2004 survey of 2,100 homeowners by the Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction reported that close to 70% believed they were insured for flood damages.112 In Canada, provincial and federal governments provide financial support when uninsurable disaster-related property damage occurs.\n","9420:  A drawback to such government relief in contrast to private insurance is that it tends to create distance between a household_s actual exposure to risk and the household_s perception of risk.113 This distance between actual and perceived risk can encourage people to reside in flood-prone areas with the understanding that government will bear the cost of some flood-related damages.114 According to the insurance industry, certain conditions must be in place in order for insurance to be a viable tool; these conditions include: 1.\n","9421:  Mutuality _ a large number of people must combine to form a risk pool or community.\n","9422:  Need _ there must be a need for insurance to cover an anticipated risk such as flooding or erosion.\n","9423:  Ability to be assessed _ the peril must be measurable and quantified in terms of possible losses of economic value.\n","9424:  Randomness _ the risk must be independent of the will of the insured and the event must not be predictable, except in a general way.\n","9425:  Economic viability _ the risk community must be able to cover the anticipated losses.\n","9426:  Similarity of threat _ the risk community must be exposed to the same threat and the occurrence of anticipated damages must result in the need for funds in the same way for each member of the risk community.\n","9427:  The success of insurance depends on how these six conditions are addressed.\n","9429:  The biggest challenge to the introduction of flood insurance in Canada is mutuality.\n","9430:  The risk of flooding does not apply equally throughout a province or throughout most communities; it is limited to specific areas.\n","9431:  Property owners most exposed to a flood risk will be motivated to purchase flood insurance.\n","9432:  Demand for flood insurance 111 112 113 114 (National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy 2011) (Sandink, et al.\n","9433:  2010) (National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy 2011) (Hallegatte 2006) 85 will be low outside of risk areas.\n","9434:  For example, flood insurance would generate minimal demand in Regina, Saskatchewan compared to Ladner, B.C.\n","9435:  Economic viability is another challenge.\n","9436:  Economic viability is threatened when large losses affect an area with a large concentration of policy holders.\n","9437:  Flood insurance rates would be prohibitively expensive for those concentrated in high-risk areas.\n","9438:  Some, but not all, of this risk can be addressed through reinsurance (i.e., spreading the risk among insurance companies to other areas with different risks).\n","9439:  Both of these challenges are related to a problem called adverse-selection.\n","9440:  Demand for flood insurance is concentrated in areas with a high risk of flooding; few people would voluntarily purchase insurance specifically to protect against flooding if they did not live in a flood risk area.\n","9441:  Adverse selection violates a basic principle of insurance, which is to spread the risk.\n","9442:  Adverse selection results in insurance rates that are prohibitively high for homeowners.\n","9444:  By bundling flood insurance with other forms of insurance, such as fire and theft, insured risks are spread over a larger pool of properties, across different perils and different rating areas.\n","9445:  Bundling broadens the risk pool and is used to lower costs and increase insurance penetration rates.\n","9446:  Bundling insurance to include flood or erosion coverage can make it unavoidable, or effectively compulsory.\n","9447:  The United Kingdom uses this approach to overcome the challenges of flood insurance.\n","9448:  There, flood insurance, whether inland or coastal, is included with other insured risks and is required by mortgage companies.\n","9449:  Bundled coverage is also in place in Japan, Spain, Portugal, Switzerland and Israel.\n","9450:  Another approach is to subsidize the cost of flood insurance.\n","9451:  In the U.S.A., flood insurance is partially subsidized by the federal government.\n","9452:  Flood insurance is intentionally kept affordable in order to enhance participation rates.\n","9453:  Insurance premiums cover administration costs and operating costs in most years, but not the full cost of major disasters.\n","9454:  Flood insurance is widely used in developed countries with extensive coastal lowlands.\n","9455:  The following provides a summary of how flood insurance is used in the U.S.A., Germany and the United Kingdom.\n","9456:  United States of America The National Flood Insurance Program is administered through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in cooperation with private insurance agencies.\n","9457:  The National Flood Insurance Program was created by the U.S. Congress in 1968 to help provide a means for property owners to financially protect themselves.\n","9458:  Prior to that, private flood coverage was excluded from standard homeowner policies and the primary recourse of flood victims was government disaster assistance.\n","9459:  In its early years, even subsidized rates did not provide a sufficient incentive for homeowners to purchase flood insurance or for communities to join the National Flood Insurance Program.\n","9460:  Subsequent legislative changes in 1974 and 1994 required federally insured or regulated lenders to require flood insurance as a condition of granting or continuing a loan for a building located in the Special Flood Hazard Area of a participating community.\n","9461:  The federal government, through FEMA, sets flood insurance premium rates, identifies flood zones and risks and sets the standard for construction in floodplains.\n","9464:  Currently over 20,000 U.S. communities participate in the National Flood Insurance Program.\n","9465:  This program offers flood insurance to homeowners, renters, and business owners.\n","9466:  The incentive is affordable rates of flood insurance and coverage up to USD$250,000 for a residential building and up to USD$100,000 for personal property (i.e., contents).\n","9467:  In return, participating communities agree to adopt and enforce bylaws (referred to as ordinances in the U.S.A.) that meet or exceed FEMA requirements designed to reduce the risk 86 of flooding.\n","9470:  Mapping plays a multipurpose role.\n","9471:  Flood Rate Insurance Maps are used to identify communities at risk (i.e., areas subject to a 100 year flood), set insurance premiums and regulate development in floodplains.\n","9472:  In the 30 years since the inception of the National Flood Insurance Program, buildings constructed to federal standards have sustained 77% lower losses than buildings without such protection.\n","9474:  Low elevation properties located near the ocean are considered high risk due to storm surge flooding and hurricane risks.\n","9475:  The cost for the maximum available building (USD$250,000) and contents (USD$100,000) insurance in a coastal high risk zone is up to USD$6,410 annually.\n","9476:  This compares to similar coverage of USD$1,717 per year in a moderate to low risk area and as low as USD$365 per year in a preferred risk (i.e., low) area.\n","9477:  In 2011, under the National Flood Insurance Program, 5.5 million flood insurance policies were written, USD$3.4 billion collected in premiums and USD$1.43 billion paid out in flood claims.\n","9479:  In an attempt to reduce a deficit of over $25 billion in the National Flood Insurance Program, the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform and Modernization Act of 2012 mandated that some subsidies be phased out, resulting in a large rate increase for some property owners.\n","9480:  The resulting backlash led to a proposed four year delay in its implementation.\n","9481:  Germany Private insurance companies in Germany have offered insurance for natural hazards as a supplement to building and contents insurance since 1991.116 This supplemental policy is optional for property owners and covers losses due to flooding.\n","9482:  However, storm surge is an uninsurable risk and is excluded from supplemental policies.\n","9483:  The market penetration for building insurance is approximately 90%, as banks require this as a condition for obtaining loans; market penetration for supplemental hazard insurance is much lower (26% in 2010).\n","9484:  Germany does not have a national system of flood hazard mapping.\n","9485:  As a result, the German insurance industry developed an online risk assessment tool called ZURS Geo.\n","9486:  This geo-based data system uses property addresses to identify the risk of flooding in any geographical area and offers a risk-based insurance premium.\n","9487:  This tool uses a four zone system, with the lowest risk being less than a 1 in 200 year event and the highest being more than a 1 in 10 year event.\n","9488:  Following a major flooding of the Elbe River in 2002, the most expensive in German history, a widespread evaluation of the state of flood insurance took place.\n","9489:  Most private sector losses were not covered by private insurance.\n","9490:  This led to the consideration of mandatory natural hazard insurance.\n","9491:  The compulsory insurance option was rejected, largely due to a major concern that buyers would experience premium shock due to much higher reinsurance requirements.\n","9492:  Other options were pursued, including 2004 legislation passed by the German Parliament prohibiting development on flood prone land.\n","9493:  As a result, it has been estimated that 10% of the land area cannot feasibly be insured, although only 1.5% of the buildings are uninsurable.\n","9494:  The German model has been criticized for lacking incentives to strengthen private loss mitigation and insurance companies for doing little to encourage precautionary measures.\n","9495:  115 116 (U.S. Department of Homeland Security; and FEMA 2012) (Sandink, et al.\n","9496:  2010) 87 United Kingdom The United Kingdom has approximately 2.2 million homes at risk due to coastal or inland flooding.\n","9498:  Insurers have agreed to provide insurance in all areas where the flood probability is less than the highest risk threshold.\n","9499:  Where the flood probability is greater than 1 in 75 years and improved flood defenses are provided, flood insurance for households and small businesses will be maintained.\n","9500:  Where the flood probability is greater than 1 in 75 years and no flood defenses are planned, flood insurance for households and small businesses is considered on a case by case basis.117 Flood risk has been grouped according to three classes.\n","9501:  The low probability Zone 1 consists of lands with a less than 1 in 1,000 year flood risk.\n","9502:  The medium probability Zone 2 consists of lands with a probability of flooding from the sea of between 1 in 200 and 1 in 1,000 years.\n","9503:  The high probability Zone 3 contains land with a greater than 1 in 200 year probability of sea flooding (or greater than 1 in 100 probability of riverine flooding).\n","9504:  Under the policy, development should be steered away from Zones 2 and 3 and toward Zone 1.\n","9505:  This policy statement includes flood risk changes resulting from climate change, particularly those associated with sea level rise.118 Building insurance is not compulsory in the United Kingdom, but such insurance is generally required to obtain mortgage financing.\n","9506:  Flood insurance is bundled as part of standard home insurance and is included in the building and contents policy.\n","9507:  Insurers generally do not refuse flood coverage for residential property, regardless of flood risk, and as a result, the vast majority of households have flood insurance coverage.119 Key features of the U.K. approach to flood management include a bundled approach to flood insurance, a very high penetration rate of 95% for flood insurance, the option for insurers to exclude very high risk homeowners in order to avoid the problem of adverse-selection, risk-based flood insurance pricing, partial risk assumption by private homeowners through a system of deductibles, variable premiums and on-site risk mitigation.\n","9509:  The Association of British Insurers indicated in 2007 that annual flood defense spending needed to increase from _500 million to a minimum of _750 million in order to maintain design-specification levels of protection.120 The national government does not have statutory authority for the management of development in flood- prone areas.\n","9510:  These responsibilities have been delegated to regional and local planning authorities although they are permissive, not mandatory.\n","9512:  Until very recently the national government_s perspective was reflected in a series of Planning Policy Statements concerning town planning.\n","9513:  Planning Policy Statement 25 concerned national policy on development and flood risk in England.\n","9514:  This policy ensured that flood risk was taken into account at all stages in the planning process to avoid inappropriate development in areas at risk of flooding, and to direct development away from the areas of highest risk.\n","9515:  These Planning Policy Statements were replaced by a single document called the National Planning Policy Framework finalized in March 2012.\n","9516:  This document retains many of the previous risk management policies, although in an edited form.\n","9517:  117 118 119 120 (Sandink, et al.\n","9518:  2010) (Department for

called on to identify as a Coastal Change Management Area any area likely to be affected by physical changes on the coast and make clear what development will be appropriate in such areas and in what circumstances, as well as to make provision for the relocation of development and infrastructure where this is needed.\n","9520:  Another policy sets out recommended contingency allowances for net sea level rise that increase from 4.0 mm/year at present, to 8.5 mm/year after 2025, to 12.0 mm/year after 2055 and to 15.0 mm/year after 2085 for London, East England and Southeast England.\n","9521:  The Potential Role of Insurance in Adaptation There are several reasons why insurance may receive increasing attention in the future.\n","9522:  One is that the areas at risk of coastal flooding and subsequent damages are anticipated to increase exponentially over time.\n","9523:  The current cost of flood damage to private property is largely met by the provincial government and, for major events, the federal government through Disaster Relief assistance.\n","9524:  The expectation of guaranteed disaster relief also reduces the incentive to take precautions in the way of flood-proofing or hazard avoidance measures.121 Senior governments are aware of the rising risk and cost implications they will increasingly have to absorb under current provisions.\n","9525:  Second, the current approach involves a considerable degree of moral hazard.\n","9526:  This refers to the tendency to take undue risks because the costs are not borne by the party taking the risk.\n","9527:  If an area is subject to flood hazard, the property owner will suffer inconvenience in the event of a flood but little economic risk.\n","9528:  The current deductible is nominal and there is no economic incentive for a property owner to undertake proactive preventative action.\n","9530:  Except in the limited cases of improvement areas in rural areas, any off-site structural protection will likely be funded through the general tax base of a local government in association with senior governments.\n","9531:  Third, the nature of flood risk due to sea level rise varies considerably from one area to another.\n","9532:  Little of that risk is borne by property owners in the areas at risk.\n","9533:  Flood insurance can address all of these concerns to some degree, because it will transfer some of the risk away from senior governments and onto private property owners through insurance premiums.\n","9534:  With variable premiums, flood insurance provides an incentive for a private property owner to undertake proactive action to reduce on-site risk.\n","9535:  Flood insurance also provides an incentive for an avoid strategy by encouraging development in areas not at risk from coastal flooding and penalizing development in areas at risk (without including land use policy and Official Community Planning considerations).\n","9536:  From the case studies discussed above, two conditions are essential to the success of flood insurance.\n","9537:  One is that the use of flood insurance must have broad application to properties at risk, whether it follows the U.S.A. or the U.K. model.\n","9538:  Second, the utility and success of flood insurance is much higher if it complements other forms of risk reduction undertaken by property owners and local governments.\n","9539:  121 (National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy 2011) 89 Advantages and Disadvantages of Potential Insurance Tool for Adaptation to Sea Level Rise Advantages Disadvantages There is an expectation that government will provide protection against the consequences of natural disasters.\n","9541:  Administration of flood insurance claims in other jurisdictions is not without controversy.\n","9542:  Would better align risk management objectives.\n","9543:  Homeowners who choose to purchase in areas at risk would pay for the additional risk and those in low risk areas would benefit from risk avoidance.\n","9544:  Flood insurance provides an incentive for an avoid strategy.\n","9545:  Flood insurance premiums will spread risk with other geographical areas also subject to flood risk.\n","9546:  Owners of residential dwellings would be able to obtain insurance for the actual value of improvements (current Disaster Financial Assistance limit in B.C.\n","9547:  is $300,000).\n","9548:  Flood insurance could be linked with other forms of insurance commonly used in Canada (e.g.\n","9549:  house and mortgage insurance) Homeowners in high risk areas incur minimal risk at present.\n","9550:  Emergency Management Emergency and post disaster management refer to measures undertaken during and after a disaster.\n","9551:  Emergency Planning and Preparedness refer to measures undertaken in advance of a disaster and is discussed in the section on Planning Tools.\n","9552:  Emergency management is distinguished from the Emergency Planning and Preparedness for two reasons.\n","9553:  First, some emergency management functions are provincial or federal responsibilities (i.e., disaster financial assistance and declaration of provincial disaster) whereas emergency planning and preparedness is primarily a local government responsibility.\n","9554:  This Primer is intended to focus on tools available to local government.\n","9555:  Second, emergency management takes place during and after a disaster, and so cannot be considered a proactive adaptation tool like the utility tools in this Primer.\n","9556:  Emergency activities can be structured in four components: (1) preparedness; (2) response; (3) recovery; and (4) mitigation122 or adaptation.\n","9557:  The first is discussed under the Emergency Planning and Preparedness tool while the following two are discussed in this section.\n","9558:  Response refers to warning and evacuation measures.\n","9559:  Recovery refers to clean-up and compensation for losses.\n","9560:  The final component may include any of the tools in this Primer and demonstrates that the process is iterative.\n","9561:  Enabling Legislation In an emergency situation, federal responsibility (all departments and agencies), where applicable, is governed by the Emergency Management Act.\n","9562:  The Act also allows for the development of programs to deal with emergency events.\n","9563:  The federal government has exclusive responsibility for emergencies related to war, armed conflict and counter-terrorism.\n","9564:  The federal government also has responsibility for First Nations reserves through Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada.\n","9565:  This Act recognizes the interests of the provinces, territories and local authorities in relation to federal assistance provided during a provincial emergency.123 The Emergency Program Act is the applicable legislation in B.C.\n","9566:  Further information about this Act is provided under the Emergency Planning and Preparedness tool.\n","9567:  The provincial emergency flood response is detailed in the British Columbia Flood Response Plan, adopted in April 2012.\n","9568:  Dike Maintenance Act of 1996 describes the powers and duties of the Inspector of Dikes, orders that may be issued, consequences of failure to carry out an order, offences and appeals.\n","9569:  Diking 122 123 (Birch Hill GeoSolutions 2008) (Birch Hill GeoSolutions 2008) 90 Authorities own and operate the public diking systems in B.C.\n","9570:  and they are obliged to have a flood response plan, which should be integrated with the Local Authority Emergency Response Plan, and provide emergency response.\n","9571:  The British Columbia Flood Response Plan describes the methodology the Province will utilize for coordinating activities to manage response to a flood event, depending on its magnitude.\n","9572:  This includes the roles and responsibilities of other levels of government, provincial ministries and agencies and other stakeholder groups.\n","9574:  For example, in Nova Scotia, the Emergency Management Act is the governing legislation dealing with emergency management and emergency powers legislation.\n","9575:  The Act creates and gives powers to the Emergency Management Officer (EMO) to act on government_s behalf in an emergency.124 In Quebec, disaster relief funds from the Ministry of Public Security currently include support for damage incurred by major storm events, both for public infrastructure and for private property.\n","9576:  For private properties damaged or destroyed in coastal areas from storm surges, up to $150,000 in compensation can be paid out to those willing to relocate, under the following conditions: _ The property in question is the primary residence (secondary residences are not covered) _ The lot and remaining structure is sold to the municipality for $1 _ The municipality cannot erect any new construction, but can create a recreational area on such lands _ The home relocated to must fall outside the setback established by the provincial government for the region For the time being this mechanism is ad hoc, activated on a case-by-case evaluation of storm events undertaken between the Province and the impacted municipalities.\n","9578:  As noted in the section on the Emergency Planning and Preparedness tool, this includes the preparation of local emergency plans.\n","9579:  Should flooding occur, the local government is responsible for activating emergency plans and their emergency operations centre, notifying the provincial authority of local emergency response activities, issuing evacuation notices, as required, establishing local centres for public inquiries and providing post-flood information.\n","9580:  If the local government requires emergency powers within the Emergency Program Act, including the evacuation of residents, a state of local emergency should be declared.\n","9581:  The British Columbia Flood Response Plan details that province_s approach in co-ordinating the ministries involved in flood management during an integrated provincial response event.\n","9582:  Emergency Management British Columbia has the primary responsibility for co-ordinating the provincial management structure.\n","9583:  The Provincial Emergency Program (PEP), a division of the Ministry of Public Safety and Solicitor General, Emergency Management B.C., works with local governments year-round, providing training and support before, during and after emergencies.\n","9585:  _ Compensation and Disaster Financial Assistance Regulation, 1995 This regulation describes compensation and disaster financial assistance, eligibility for assistance and what is covered.\n","9586:  Disaster financial assistance may be claimed for eligible personal expenses (i.e., the principal residence of the owner of a structure damaged or destroyed in a disaster and _the necessities of life_ of a tenant, small business expenses, farm operation expenses, charitable or volunteer expenses and local government body expenses).\n","9587:  Assistance is limited to 80% of an accepted claim over a deductible of $1,000 up to a maximum of $300,000.\n","9588:  Financial assistance to repair or rebuild a structure may be denied if assistance has been provided on two previous occasions.\n","9589:  _ Local Authority Emergency Management Regulation, 1995 This regulation outlines the required contents of Local Emergency Plans and defines the powers and duties of a local authority under the Act.\n","9590:  As previously noted, Quebec provides for up to $150,000 in compensation for those willing to relocate.\n","9591:  Where the market value of the damaged property is less than $150,000, disaster relief has served its intended purposes of providing compensation for private losses and acquiring high risk property to ensure the Province is not subject to repeat claims for compensation.\n","9592:  A key challenge is where the value exceeds $150,000, since property owners lack a financial incentive to relocate or undertake additional protective measures; this leads to continued or increased vulnerability on the same site.\n","9593:  Disaster Financial Assistance Arrangements Disaster Financial Assistance Arrangements are designed to provide financial assistance from the federal government on a sliding scale where disaster damages exceed $1.00 per capita of provincial population.\n","9594:  For disasters below this threshold, no federal assistance is provided.\n","9595:  The federal contribution increases to 50% where damages are between $1.00 and $3.00 per capita of provincial population.\n","9596:  The federal contribution increases to 75% if the damages are between $3.00 and $5.00 per capita of provincial population and to 90% if they exceed $5.00 per capita of provincial population.\n","9598:  Each province is responsible for the development and implementation of disaster recovery assistance programs, for deciding when disaster payments are provided, and for determining the amount that will be provided in their jurisdiction.\n","9599:  A 2008 revision allowed for a 15% supplement of total disaster recovery payouts to provinces in order to mitigate the impacts of future hazard events.\n","9600:  The key objective of the revised program is to reduce or prevent the recurrence of damages.\n","9601:  92 The Cost of Sea Level Rise and Adaptation The Cost of Sea Level Rise and Adaptation The cost of coastal adaptation is considered to be the sum of all investments (and maintenance costs) necessary to protect coastline and human settlements located in at-risk areas.\n","9602:  The estimated annualized cost for optimal levels of protection can be modest, frequently less than 0.1% of national Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\n","9603:  However, adaptation costs may be high relative to the GDP of coastal areas, as there is no guarantee protection costs will be absorbed fully at the national level.125 The National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy released a report, _Paying the Price: The Economic Costs of Climate Change for Canada_ in September 2011.\n","9604:  The study noted that Prince Edward Island has the largest proportion of its land area at risk due to flooding by 2050 as a result of climate change.\n","9605:  B.C., on the other hand, has the lowest proportion of its land area at risk but the majority of dwellings at risk, due to the high housing density in the Lower Mainland, much of which is low lying.\n","9606:  The Lower Mainland, consisting of Metro Vancouver and the lower Fraser River Valley, is very vulnerable to sea level rise because of a 127 kilometre system of dikes, which were not built with sea level rise factored into the design.\n","9607:  This area also has very expensive real estate subject to flood risks.\n","9608:  The report examined coastal lands that would be at risk without sea level rise (baseline case) and the additional lands at risk due to climate change.\n","9609:  The report evaluated two adaptation strategies for coastal areas: climate related development planning and strategic retreat.\n","9610:  The first strategy prohibited future construction in areas expected to be at risk of flooding by 2050 in a high climate change scenario.\n","9611:  No additional growth would be permitted, but existing dwellings could be rebuilt following a storm surge.\n","9612:  The second strategy involves a gradual abandonment of newly flooded areas.\n","9613:  The National Round Table found that both strategies reduce the overall cost of climate change, but that strategic retreat produced benefits one order of magnitude higher than climate-wise development planning.\n","9614:  When pursued in combination, the two strategies could lower the cumulative cost by $1 to $6 billion over the next century.\n","9615:  Funding Projects Related to Sea Level Rise in Canada There is currently no national program for funding shoreline protection or for combating the impacts of sea level rise along the 243,000 kilometres of coastline in Canada.\n","9616:  Some funding for shoreline protection is provided via programs such as the Building Canada Fund, Gas Tax Fund, Disaster Financial Assistance Program, Small Crafts Harbour Program, Infrastructure projects, Highway funding programs, St. Lawrence Plan, Green Municipal Fund and other federal initiatives.\n","9617:  Funding is also available from Environment Canada, Environmental Damages Fund for the protection of and restoration of wildlife habitats in coastal areas.\n","9618:  Natural Resources Canada has also made funding available to help assess the impacts of climate change and how to mitigate and adapt to them.\n","9619:  The Regional Adaptation Collaborative program has contributed valuable funding to help provinces, local governments and individuals improve their decision-making in regard to adapting to sea level rise, storm surges, heavy to intense precipitation events, flooding and other events related to climate change.\n","9620:  125 (Hallegate 2011) 94 Major damage from the December 2010 storm in the Bas-Saint-Laurent Region, qC In December 2010, a major storm event in the Bas-Saint-Laurent Region, QC eroded seven metres of the shoreline and destroyed nearly 100 homes in the region.\n","9621:  In the absence of a regulatory framework for dealing with such natural disasters, the Minister of Public Security announced that the province would compensate property owners up to $150,000 toward rebuilding elsewhere on safer grounds.\n","9622:  The agreement required owners to sell their property to the municipality for $1.\n","9623:  The municipality, as owner of the land, was not able to build on the land but could use it for recreational purposes.\n","9624:  Eighty compensation packages were issued once evaluations were conducted by the provincial government.\n","9625:  Many owners refused the packages, as $150,000 was not enough money for relocation.\n","9626:  In some cases, residents unable to supplement the compensation were forced to remain in damaged homes in high-risk areas.\n","9627:  Given the lack of regulation on erosion in the area, construction and reconstruction permits are still being issued in high risk areas.\n","9628:  Recognizing that it would not be able to offer similar compensation in the future, in 2011 the province suggested the region adopt a 30m standard setback.\n","9629:  Neither the region nor any of its municipalities adopted this standard, and requested more detailed research be completed in order to establish setback lines per coastal zone based on regionally specific science (J.-p. Savard 2012).\n","9630:  Quebec is a province with significant funds available for adapting to seal level rise.\n","9631:  The financing available to municipalities for adapting to sea level rise comes via the Framework for Natural Disaster Risk Prevention Funds from the Ministry of Public Security.\n","9632:  In November 2006, the province designated $55 million to support municipal adaptation projects to climate change, with $26.6 million specifically earmarked for adaptation to coastal erosion.\n","9633:  Municipalities apply to the fund and contribute a portion of the total initial budget.\n","9634:  The provincial money represents a one-time investment _ the municipality is responsible for the cost of maintenance over time.\n","9635:  This fund is expected to be renewed under the 2013-2020 Climate Change Action Plan.\n","9636:  Under this program, Sept-_les was approved for a $6 million project to rebuild the sandbank on the east end of the city.\n","9637:  The municipality would have to contribute $2 million of the total budget, and would be responsible for all maintenance costs over time.\n","9638:  The local government had difficulty obtaining public support for the levy needed to raise funds, as it would have been applied to all residents while only the ocean-front property owners would benefit.\n","9639:  In the end, Sept-_les declined the grant, as it could not find a realistic means of coming up with their portion of the contribution required.\n","9640:  Municipalities in Atlantic Canada that own property or infrastructure along the coastline have taken action to protect their capital assets from sea level rise, storm surges and other climate events.\n","9641:  This includes installing shoreline protection systems at facilities such as waste water treatment facilities, streets, parks, recreational facilities, and other municipal infrastructure.\n","9642:  In 2011, Nova Scotia implemented a new requirement for Federal Gas Tax Reporting for the period 2010- 2014.\n","9643:  Nova Scotia municipalities must now prepare Municipal Climate Change Action Plans (CCAP) to access the Gas Tax funds.\n","9644:  These plans must be submitted by December 31, 2013.\n","9645:  Municipalities in British Columbia have also taken proactive action.\n","9647:  Federal-provincial cost sharing programs in B.C.\n","9648:  have played an essential role in the implementation of structural protection measures.\n","9649:  95 Funding Programs in Other Countries New Jersey Shore Protection Program The State of New Jersey provides an excellent example of innovative funding.\n","9650:  The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection has a Shore Protection Fund which dedicates USD$25 million annually _to protect existing development and infrastructure from storm surges, sea level rise and shoreline migration through dune creation and maintenance, beach nourishment projects, and construction and repair of shore protection structures._ The monies for this fund are generated from a realty transfer fee imposed on the recording of deeds transferring real property, calculated based on the amount paid in the deed.\n","9651:  Western Australia Coastal Protection Policy and Grant Program Western Australia_s Department of Transport provides up to 50% of the cost of planning, investigation, design and construction of emergency coastal protection works, public coastal protection works, necessary data collection and the maintenance of marine structures for permanent coastal protection.\n","9652:  Once structures are built, the local coastal managers have ownership of the structures and are responsible for ongoing repair and maintenance.\n","9653:  England _ Flood and Coastal Resilience Partnership Funding The United Kingdom allocates _2.1 billion of partnership funding annually for flood and coastal erosion risk management projects in England.\n","9654:  Funding levels are related to the number of households protected, the damages being prevented and any other benefits.\n","9656:  The schemes approved are intended to reduce the risk of flooding from rivers, seas, groundwater and surface water, and to reduce the risks from coastal erosion.\n","9657:  Netherlands _ Coastal Flood Risk Management In the Netherlands all funding for strengthening flood defences or nourishment comes from the national government, and from 2000-2006 averaged _550 million per year.\n","9658:  This amount includes funding from water boards, which fund maintenance costs via water board taxes.\n","9659:  In the Netherlands, a storm surge warning system has been developed for exposed areas, as forecasting times for coastal flooding from storm surges tend to be shorter than for river flooding.\n","9661:  The design of these flood defence structures are related to extreme storm surge levels.\n","9662:  For instance, in the provinces of Noord-Holland and Zuid-Holland, the structures are designed to withstand the effects of a storm with a probability of occurrence once in 10,000 years, which corresponds to a storm surge level of 5 m+ Dutch Ordinance Level (NAP).\n","9663:  The Dutch government has also made a policy decision to maintain the coastline at its 1990 position.\n","9664:  In the National Spatial Strategy of 2004, the Netherlands guarantee safety against flooding and the preservation of the spatial quality of the coastal zone.\n","9665:  96 Appendices Appendix A _ Glossary ADAPTATION means an adjustment in natural or human systems to a new or changing

increased both as a result of new research and through practical experience.\n","10959:  Canada_s climate is changing, with observed changes in air temperature, precipitation, snow and ice cover and other indicators.\n","10961:  Changes in climate are increasingly affecting Canada_s natural environment, economic sectors and the health of Canadians.\n","10963:  Adaptation is accepted as a necessary response to climate change, complementing global measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n","10964:  Adaptation enhances the social and economic resilience of Canadians to climate change impacts.\n","10965:  Adaptation is occurring with increasing frequency and enhanced engagement.\n","10966:  Continued action will help to build capacity, address information needs and overcome challenges.\n","10967:  Adaptation can sometimes turn risks into opportunities, and opportunities into benefits.\n","10969:  INTRODUCTION The climate is changing _ in Canada and throughout the world.\n","10970:  Globally, international assessments continue to identify rising air and ocean temperatures, shifting precipitation patterns, shrinking glaciers, declining snow cover and sea ice extent, rising sea level and changes in extreme events (IPCC, 2013).\n","10971:  While rates of change vary from one indicator to another, the directions of change are consistent with climate warming, and climate models project that many of the observed trends will continue over the coming decades and beyond.\n","10972:  Reducing greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs; mitigation) is necessary to lessen the magnitude and rate of climate change, but additional impacts are unavoidable, even with aggressive global mitigation efforts, due to inertia in the climate system.\n","10973:  Therefore, we also need to adapt _ make adjustments in our activities and decisions in order to reduce risks, moderate harm or take advantage of new opportunities.\n","10974:  All levels of government, researchers, the private sector and non-government organizations now view adaptation as an essential complement to mitigation.\n","10975:  In 2008, the Government of Canada released a national-scale science assessment of climate change impacts and adaptation (From Impacts to Adaptation: Canada in a Changing Climate).\n","10976:  That assessment used a regional approach to discuss current and future climate change impacts and vulnerabilities in Canada, as well as adaptation options.\n","10977:  It built upon the findings of Canada_s first national-scale assessment (The Canada Country Study, 1998) and drew conclusions from all available relevant literature.\n","10978:  This report _ Canada in a Changing Climate: Sector Perspectives on Impacts and Adaptation _ is an update to the 2008 assessment.\n","10979:  It focuses on new information and knowledge, assessing advances made in understanding climate change impacts and adaptation from a sectoral perspective, based primarily on literature published up to the end of 2012.\n","10980:  This synthesis draws from the individual chapters of the report, which include an overview of Canada_s changing climate (Ch.\n","10981:  2), thematic chapters focused on sectors (Ch.\n","10982:  3 to 8) and the concluding chapter on adaptation research and practice (Ch.\n","10983:  The key findings of chapters 3 to 9 are summarized in Box 1.\n","10984:  The rest of the synthesis is structured around high-level conclusions, supported by examples and insights from an integrative analysis across the report themes1.\n","10985:  1 This Synthesis does not repeat the references provided in the underlying chapters, but rather directs the reader to individual chapters of the report where specific references can be found.\n","10986:  Occasional specific references are included when the source was not cited within another chapter or to provide additional context.\n","10987:  2 Canada in a Changing Climate: Sector Perspectives on Impacts and Adaptation BOX 1 KEY FINDINGS FROM THE CHAPTERS Natural Resources (Forestry, Energy and Mining, Chapter 3) _ Climate change will exacerbate existing climate risks related to the planning and management of natural resources.\n","10989:  heat, cold, precipitation) and to gradual changes, such as permafrost degradation, sea level rise, and plant species migration.\n","10990:  Climate change will also present new opportunities for the natural resource sectors, particularly in relation to northern economic development.\n","10991:  _ Consideration of multiple stressors is critical to understanding adaptation in the natural resource sectors.\n","10992:  Climate change itself is rarely identified as a priority concern, with industry focused on other immediate stressors, such as economic drivers.\n","10996:  _ While awareness of climate change impacts and implementation of adaptation actions is most evident in sectors where there is a clear and direct relationship between climate and resource supply, notably forestry and hydroelectricity, the application of adaptive management approaches to address climate change impacts is seen across all natural resource sectors.\n","10997:  Food Production (Chapter 4) _ The impacts of climate change differ significantly between agriculture, fisheries, and non-commercial food supply, but common challenges include increased losses from invasive pests and diseases, and risks to transportation systems upon which the sectors rely.\n","10998:  _ The net medium-term outlook is for a likely modest increase in agricultural food production.\n","10999:  Longer and warmer growing seasons would allow higher-value warmer-weather crops to be grown further north (where soil conditions permit), lengthen outdoor feeding seasons for livestock, and allow the maple syrup industry to expand northward.\n","11000:  However, there will likely be new pests and diseases, as well as more severe outbreaks of current ones, and challenges associated with extreme weather events and the reduced predictability of inter-annual weather variability that could negatively affect production.\n","11002:  _ Canada is expected to remain a net exporter of aquatic foods at the aggregate level, with total biomass of production from wild, capture fisheries in Canada expected to increase due to climate-induced shifts in fish distributions.\n","11003:  Regional impacts from invading species, physical habitat changes and societal responses to shifts in availability and access to aquatic food resources will gradually determine future patterns of use and overall economic implications.\n","11004:  _ Aquaculture has a greater scope for adaptation to climate change than other fisheries, making it less vulnerable and better positioned to take advantage of opportunities than capture fisheries, and subsistence fisheries in particular.\n","11005:  Box 1 continued on next page Synthesis 3 Industry (Chapter 5) _ Industrial activity is sensitive to variations in weather and in extreme events, with considerable differences in the types and extent of impacts on production, operations, and revenue among and within sectors.\n","11006:  _ Changes in industry practices have been predominantly reactive, responding to variation in the weather or extreme events, rather than proactive anticipation of future climate change.\n","11008:  _ Adaptive actions implemented by industry vary by sector, and may be under-reported for strategic reasons.\n","11010:  _ There is little published research about indirect impacts of climate change on industry, such as changes associated with consumer demand, supply chains, real estate or other assets, adaptation by other sectors, legal liability or government regulation.\n","11012:  Biodiversity and Protected Areas (Chapter 6) _ Climate-related shifts in species distributions have already been documented for plants and animals in Canada.\n","11013:  In many locations, differential range shifts among species are likely to result in novel ecosystems that have different species assemblages, structural attributes, and ecological functions than existing ones.\n","11014:  _ For some species, the current and projected rates of environmental change exceed their natural ability to adapt, increasing stress and threatening biodiversity.\n","11015:  As a result, climate change is magnifying the importance of managing ecosystems in a manner that enhances resilience and preserves biodiversity.\n","11016:  _ Protected areas, including parks, wildlife reserves and marine protected areas will play an important role in the conservation of biodiversity by providing _refuge_ or migration corridors for native species, helping to maintain genetic diversity.\n","11017:  _ Many Canadian jurisdictions are expanding their parks and protected area systems as part of their overall management plans and climate change adaptation strategies.\n","11018:  Associated research, monitoring, citizen science, public awareness, and visitor experience programs build understanding, engage the public and help them contribute to meaningful participatory decision-making.\n","11019:  _ Ecological restoration can strengthen resilience to climate change.\n","11020:  Integration of climate change adaptation strategies into restoration decision-making in Canada, as elsewhere, is complex.\n","11021:  Human Health (Chapter 7) _ Stronger evidence has emerged since 2008 of the wide range of health risks to Canadians posed by a changing climate.\n","11022:  For example, climate-sensitive diseases (e.g.\n","11023:  Lyme disease) and vectors are moving northward into Canada and will likely continue to expand their range.\n","11024:  In addition, new research suggests climate change will exacerbate air pollution issues in some parts of Canada, although further reductions in air contaminant emissions could offset climate-related changes to ground-level ozone and particulate matter concentrations.\n","11025:  _ A range of climate-related natural hazards continues to impact communities, presenting increasing risks to future health.\n","11026:  Recent flood and wildfire events have severely impacted communities through destruction of infrastructure and displacement of populations.\n","11027:  _ Many adaptation activities are being taken from local to national levels to help Canadians prepare for the health impacts of climate change.\n","11028:  Adaptation planning considers the underlying causes of health vulnerability, which differ across urban, rural, coastal and northern communities.\n","11029:  Box 1 continued on next page 4 Canada in a Changing Climate: Sector Perspectives on Impacts and Adaptation _ Provincial, territorial and local health authorities are gaining an increasing knowledge of climate change and health vulnerabilities through assessments and targeted research, and some jurisdictions have begun mainstreaming climate change considerations into existing health policies and programs.\n","11031:  _ Adaptation tools and measures, such as heat alert and response systems, projections of vector-borne disease expansion and greening urban environments can help protect Canadians from the effects of climate change being felt now, and those from future impacts.\n","11032:  Water and Transportation Infrastructure (Chapter 8) _ Well-maintained infrastructure is more resilient to a changing climate.\n","11033:  This is especially true with respect to gradual changes in temperature and precipitation patterns.\n","11034:  Key vulnerabilities are associated with the impacts of extreme weather events, which can overwhelm the capacity of water infrastructure.\n","11035:  _ Over the past five years, the work of the PIEVC (Public Infrastructure Engineering Vulnerability Committee) has been an important driver of progress on understanding how to adapt Canada_s infrastructure to climate change.\n","11036:  The broadly applicable, risk-based assessment protocol developed by the PIEVC allows engineers and planners to view and address climate change as one factor among many affecting system resiliency, and plan accordingly.\n","11037:  _ Consideration of climate change as an element of adaptive asset management encourages consideration of climate factors as part of ongoing system monitoring, and informs decisions regarding the most cost-effective approaches for infrastructure design, operation and maintenance.\n","11038:  _ Codes, standards and related instruments (CSRI) are recognized as a potentially important driver of infrastructure adaptation, but there are few examples of CSRIs in Canada that considered historic changes or projected future changes in climate when they were developed.\n","11039:  Further assessment of current and future climate-related risks to infrastructure systems would help to inform appropriate adjustments to design codes and standards for addressing future climate.\n","11040:  Adaptation: Linking Research and Practice (Chapter 9) _ Adaptation is being undertaken in Canada to achieve a range of goals, such as increasing capacity to adapt, improving resilience to specific climate events (especially extremes), and enhancing ability to deal with different climate conditions.\n","11041:  Among sectors, those with a demonstrated high sensitivity and exposure to climate and weather are generally most active in taking steps to understand, assess and manage vulnerability and risk related to climate change.\n","11042:  _ Adaptation is not solely a local issue, although examples from the municipal level still appear to dominate.\n","11044:  _ Understanding of the barriers and challenges to adaptation has improved, with recognition that factors beyond the basic determinants of adaptive capacity need to be addressed.\n","11045:  As a result, understanding of how to overcome key barriers and enable adaptation has improved.\n","11046:  _ Adaptation implementation in Canada is still in its early stages.\n","11047:  Planning and policy exercises, and efforts to build capacity and raise awareness comprise much of the adaptation action documented, with relatively few documented examples of implementation of specific changes to reduce vulnerability to future climate change, or take advantage of potential opportunities.\n","11048:  _ Several factors can help accelerate the transition between awareness and action, including leadership, targeted awareness-raising and supportive strategies or policies.\n","11049:  Experiencing extreme weather events, as well as observing impacts of gradual changes (e.g.\n","11050:  sea level rise) also stimulates adaptation.\n","11051:  Synthesis 5 CANADA_S CLIMATE IS CHANGING, WITH OBSERVED CHANGES IN AIR TEMPERATURE, PRECIPITATION, SNOW AND ICE COVER AND OTHER INDICATORS.\n","11052:  FURTHER CHANGES IN CLIMATE ARE INEVITABLE (CHAPTER 2).\n","11053:  Over the last six decades, Canada has become warmer, with average temperatures over land increasing by 1.5_C between 1950 and 2010 (Figure 1).\n","11054:  This rate of warming is about double the global average reported over the same time period by Hartmann et al., (2013).\n","11055:  Warming has been occurring even faster in many areas of northern Canada, and has been observed in all seasons, although the greatest warming has occurred in winter and spring.\n","11056:  The annual number of extreme warm days has also risen, while the number of cold nights has declined.\n","11057:  Table 1 provides examples of documented changes in Canada for a variety of indicators of the physical climate system.\n","11058:  FIGURE 1: Patterns of

southern Canada, there has been a shift in precipitation type, with decreasing snowfall and increasing rainfall Observations suggest decreasing trends in maximum and minimum river flows over the period 1970-2005 in much of southern Canada, with increases in minimum flows in western Nunavut, Northwest Territories, Yukon and northern British Columbia Annual snowfall has declined over most of southern Canada and increased in the north over the last 6 decades Negative trends in snow cover extent have been observed during spring over the Canadian landmass, with largest declines observed in June Permafrost temperatures at numerous borehole sites across Canada have increased over the past two to three decades Global average sea level rose about 21 cm between 1880 and 2012 at an average rate of 1.6 mm/year Relative sea level rise of over 3 mm/year has been observed on coastlines of Atlantic Canada and the Beaufort Sea coast, with lower amounts along Pacific coastlines.\n","11063:  Relative sea level fall of 10 mm/year has been observed around Hudson Bay where the land is rising rapidly due to post-glacial rebound End-of-summer minimum ice extent has declined at a rate of 13% per decade over 1979-2012, while maximum winter sea ice extent has declined at a rate of 2.6% per decade A shift in ice cover from one dominated by thick multi-year ice (MYI) to one increasingly dominated by thin first-year ice (FYI) has been observed Declines in winter sea ice extent have been observed in the Labrador-Newfoundland and Gulf of St. Lawrence region Western Cordilleran glaciers are losing mass and shrinking rapidly to the smallest extents in several millennia.\n","11064:  Glaciers in British Columbia and Alberta have lost, respectively, about 11% and 25% of their surface area over the period 1985-2005, while glaciers in Yukon have lost about 22% since the 1950s Significant negative mass balances are evident from the early 1960s into the first decade of the 21st century.\n","11065:  The rate of mass loss for glaciers throughout the High Arctic has increased sharply since 2005, in direct response to warm regional summer temperatures Trends towards earlier ice-free dates (lakes) and ice break-up dates (rivers) have been observed for most of the country since the mid-20th century but are particularly evident in Western Canada Long-term changes in ocean temperature (increasing), salinity (variable sign), and acidity (increasing) have been observed in all three of Canada_s oceans.\n","11066:  Long-term decreases in subsurface dissolved oxygen levels

the country and for the nation as a whole (Figure 2).\n","11073:  Trends in annual precipitation have been less uniform across the Canadian landmass than those of annual air temperature.\n","11074:  While significant changes in extreme precipitation have been observed in some areas of the country, no consistent pattern is evident for the country as a whole.\n","11075:  There have also been observed trends in other climate indicators in Canada (see Table 1).\n","11076:  The Arctic has seen rapid declines in sea ice extent, both in summer and winter (Figure 3).\n","11077:  In addition, snowfall has decreased across southern Canada, while snow cover is melting earlier in spring, and glaciers in western Canada and the Arctic are shrinking.\n","11078:  At the global scale, sea level over the past century has risen in response to warmer ocean temperatures (thermal expansion) and to the melting of glaciers, ice caps and ice sheets.\n","11079:  Regional patterns of sea level rise along Canadian coastlines are strongly influenced by vertical land motion, with sea level rising rapidly at some sites where the land is subsiding, and falling in others where the land is rising (see

that, similar to other developed countries, adaptation in Canada is still in its early stages overall.\n","11199:  It is also recognized that the methodology of this assessment, with its focus on scientific literature, may result in an underestimation of the actual number of adaptation actions being undertaken in Canada.\n","11200:  Planned adaptation takes time.\n","11201:  Adaptation often

 While adaptation research and programming tend to focus on reducing vulnerability to negative impacts, some impacts of climate change could represent opportunities.\n","11212:  Capturing these opportunities requires appropriate adaptation.\n","11213:  This may be most evident in the tourism and agriculture sectors, which both stand to potentially benefit from longer summers.\n","11214:  With effective adaptation (e.g.\n","11215:  strategies to deal with potential water shortages), major warm-weather tourism markets in Canada could benefit from climate change, with the golf industry,

(e.g.\n","11217:  corn and soybeans in new areas in Quebec, canola in Prince George, BC, and spring seeded small grains in western Alberta and northeastern BC; Ch.\n","11218:  Producers would need to adapt their crop selections and timing (e.g.\n","11219:  seeding earlier in order to decrease exposure to drier late summer conditions) to take advantage of these opportunities.\n","11220:  In all cases, risks related to increased pests, heat waves and other extreme events will also need to be addressed.\n","11221:  In the North, changing climate and ice conditions bring potential economic opportunities related to natural resource development and tourism (Ch.\n","11222:  3, 5, 6).\n","11223:  However, in addition to presenting opportunities for employment and investment, such activities

1 INTRODUCTION _We are becoming more vulnerable to the impacts of climate variability and change because of increasing urbanisation, a growing and Aging population and deteriorating public infrastructure.\n","11346:  identify and prepare for some of the impacts of climate change.\n","11347:  It provides information on how you can use urban forests to manage some of the impacts of changing climates, and how to adapt these urban forests so that they survive and thrive in future climates.\n","11348:  This is a high-level overview that can be used by staff and elected officials in B.C._s communities_small and large, rural and urban_including those who do not have professional arborists or urban foresters on staff.\n","11349:  If you have comments or suggestions to improve this resource, please contact treesfortomorrow@gov.bc.ca.\n","11350:  Global Climate Change The Earth is heating up.\n","11351:  While natural causes have played a role, most of the atmospheric warming observed over the last 50 years is attributed to burning of fossil fuels, land clearing, and other human activities that have increased the concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\n","11352:  This has already changed climates in British Columbia and around the world, and scientists warn that further climate change is unavoidable.1 1 Climate change is not just about changes in temperature.\n","11353:  The warming of the atmosphere leads to long-term changes in rain and snowfall patterns, wind and ocean currents, ice and snow accumulation, and other aspects of climate.\n","11354:  It can increase the frequency of droughts, heat waves, heavy rainfall and snowfall, and other extreme weather events.\n","11357:  Such impacts will increasingly challenge the capacity of government, business, and community leaders to protect public safety, manage natural resources, and promote social and economic sustainability.\n","11358:  Climate Change Adaption Much emphasis has been placed on ways to mitigate climate change by reducing use of fossil fuels and cutting greenhouse gas emissions.\n","11359:  This remains of great importance.\n","11360:  However, even if all greenhouse gas emissions were to stop tomorrow, the excess greenhouse gases already in the atmosphere would continue to affect climate for the next 30_40 years.\n","11361:  In addition to reducing emissions, communities need to adapt to climate change impacts_to prepare for a different future.\n","11362:  _Business as usual_ is no longer an option.\n","11363:  Adaptation to climate change means making adjustments to minimize adverse effects and maximize opportunities.\n","11364:  It is sometimes also described as an ongoing process that involves: _ Assessment to identify relevant climate changes and impacts, vulnerabilities, and priorities for action; Implementation of these plans; and _ _ Monitoring results and updating plan(s) as new information becomes available.\n","11366:  For this reason, the Union of British Columbia Municipalities and Ministry of Community, Sport and Cultural Development prepared Planting our Future: A Tree Toolkit for Communities.\n","11367:  The toolkit helps communities_small and large, rural and urban_to maximize the values from their urban forests and to address challenges that they are facing.\n","11368:  This urban forest adaptation guide is a companion piece to Planting our Future.\n","11369:  Planting our Future includes information on the values of urban forests, issues and challenges, and tools and strategies to achieve a healthy and sustainable urban forest.\n","11370:  It is available from http://www.treesfortomorrow.gov.bc.ca/.\n","11371:  Urban Forests: A Climate Adaptation Guide 2 The communities that take proactive steps to adapt to climate change will be better prepared for its impacts.\n","11372:  The attention, time and money invested will produce valuable returns in terms of cost savings (e.g., related to energy, fire suppression or storm-clean up) and improved economic performance (e.g., through enhanced livability, business and staff recruitment, tourism, and property values).\n","11373:  Done well, steps to adapt to climate change could protect human life and property, avoid or reduce future costs, and exploit new opportunities related to changes in _Integrating climate change adaptation into decision-making is an opportunity to enhance resilience and reduce the long-term costs and impacts of climate change._ - Natural Resources Canada3 Mitigation refers to actions that reduce human- caused greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions into the atmosphere.\n","11374:  Adaptation refers to actions that better prepare communities and businesses for climate change and its impacts.\n","11375:  Adaptation actions typically reduce risks and increase opportunities related to climate change.\n","11376:  Sequestration refers to the removal of carbon from the atmosphere.\n","11377:  Trees and other vegetation sequester carbon as they grow, storing it in their trunks, roots, branches, and leaves.\n","11378:  local climate_making lemonade from climate change lemons!\n","11379:  Urban Forests and Climate Change Adaptation While there are many benefits to be derived from urban forests (see Planting our Future), this document focuses only on those related to climate change adaptation.\n","11380:  Equally, there are many ways to adapt communities to climate change, but this document focuses only the _tree-centric_ approaches (Figure 1).\n","11381:  However, this guide is linked to much wider thinking about climate change adaptation, including broader impacts on land use, infrastructure, and utilities planning.\n","11382:  Section 2 of this guide provides an overview of some of the impacts of climate change on communities and urban forests, such as more frequent heat waves and intense precipitation events.\n","11383:  Section 3 outlines ways that urban forests can help to manage these impacts, for example by providing shade and detaining stormwater.\n","11384:  Section 4 recognizes that urban forests themselves will be under stress from new climatic conditions and new pests and diseases, and looks at ways to manage urban forests so that they survive and thrive in future climates.\n","11385:  Introduction 3 Provincial Climate Action Initiatives The Province is undertaking a variety of initiatives to mitigate and adapt to climate change.\n","11387:  _ The Greenhouse Gas Reduction Targets Act (2007) set legislated targets of provincial emissions reductions of 33% below 2007 levels by 2020 and 80% below 2007 levels by 2050.\n","11388:  _ The B.C.\n","11389:  Climate Action Plan (2008) outlines strategies and initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n","11390:  _ More than 179 local governments have signed the Climate Action Charter, committing to carbon neutrality by 2012.\n","11391:  _ The Climate Action Toolkit is a website providing information and cases studies of local government _ initiatives towards climate action.\n","11392:  Preparing for Climate Change: British Columbia_s Adaptation Strategy (2009) outlines government_s approach to adaptation, builds on the Province_s past accomplishments, and provides a framework for future climate change adaptation initiatives.\n","11393:  _ The B.C.\n","11394:  Regional Adaptation Collaborative aims to advance adaptation decision-making in British Columbia.\n","11395:  One of its programs is developing tools and adaptation plans for communities.\n","11396:  _ The Ministry of Forests, Mines and Lands established a Climate Change Task Team to review potential impacts of climate change on provincial forest and range resources and identify knowledge gaps, with recommendations provided in Preparing for Climate Change: Adapting to Impacts on British Columbia_s Forest and Range Resources _ The Future Forest Ecosystems Initiative focuses on adapting B.C._s forest and range management framework so that it continues to maintain and enhance the resilience and productivity of B.C._s ecosystems as the climate changes.\n","11397:  _ The Zero Net Deforestation Act encourages an equal area of trees be planted for carbon storage to offset any forest land that is permanently cleared for another use.\n","11398:  _ The Community Energy and Emission Inventory is tracking land use change at the Regional District level, including an estimate of deforestation and the resulting CO2 emissions.\n","11399:  More information and links to these provincial initiatives can be found at http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/cas/ resources/reports.html and http://www.toolkit.bc.ca.\n","11400:  Urban Forests: A Climate Adaptation Guide 4 Figure 1: Climate adaptation and urban forests _Urban forests_ are the total collection of trees and their growing environments found within our communities and their surrounding areas, from villages to city centres.\n","11402:  They include cultivated landscapes, natural areas and, in some communities, local _working_ or managed forests.\n","11403:  Although they are referred to as _urban_ forests, this term applies equally to small and rural communities.\n","11404:  _Urban forestry_ is the deliberate management of these treed environments to provide a wide array of economic, environmental and social services to communities.\n","11405:  Urban forests can be a key asset in supporting more liveable, healthy, sustainable and economically vibrant communities.\n","11406:  Introduction 5 2 Climate Change and Your Comunuity From Impacts to Adaptation: Canada in a Changing Climate 2007 (Natural Resources Canada, 2007) includes a discussion of expected climate change impacts and case studies of responses.\n","11407:  Future climates and related impacts will vary from place to place, but all communities in B.C.\n","11408:  will be affected in some way.\n","11409:  This guide does not provide detailed information about future climate predictions for specific regions in B.C., but that information is available from the Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium4 (PCIC).\n","11410:  A good place to start is the PCIC Plan2Adapt website, which includes information on predicted impacts by regional district.\n","11411:  PCIC can also provide information tailored to your community.\n","11412:  Projected climate changes for British Columbia as a whole, and some of the ongoing and expected impacts, are described below.\n","11413:  Climate Change in B.C.\n","11414:  Places in the northern latitudes_such as British Columbia_ are expected to experience greater warming than the global average.\n","11416:  (Figure 2).\n","11417:  Winters will likely be wetter throughout the province, with

decades to come, and that climate will therefore change more rapidly than in the past.\n","11426:  These maps represent only one of a range of possible futures for British Columbia; while scientists can tell us a lot about what is likely to happen, there is still uncertainty in these projections.\n","11427:  One of the challenges of adaptation is to identify strategies that are robust across the full range of possible futures.\n","11428:  Changes to Forested Ecosystems Future forests will be different from those of today.\n","11429:  The climate _envelopes_ suitable for many tree species currently found in B.C.\n","11430:  are moving north and to higher elevations.\n","11431:  With even a 1_C increase in mean annual temperature, ecosystems are expected to shift up to 150 km northwards and 300 m higher.\n","11432:  These changes will have profound impacts not only on the trees, but on the associated plants, animals and ecosystem processes (e.g., pollination systems) that rely on B.C._s forests.\n","11433:  Many species of plants and animals will likely become endangered or perhaps even extinct.\n","11434:  B.C._s conifer species in particular are expected to lose much of their climatically suitable habitat.8 A study of future forest ecosystems in B.C.\n","11435:  predicts that in the 21st century, climatic suitability for spruce and Douglas-fir forests will Climate and Weather The weather varies from place to place, from year to year and even from decade to decade, subject to natural cycles such as the El Ni_o Southern Oscillation (ENSO).\n","11436:  For example, in 100 Mile House, an El Ni_o winter can mean winter temperatures 4_6_C warmer with 10_15% less precipitation, while a La Ni_a winter makes it 1_2_C cooler than average with 10_15% more precipitation.7 This is further complicated by a longer term natural cycle, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which can further affect annual and seasonal temperature and rainfall.\n","11437:  Climate is measured based on long-term averages of weather in many different places and environments.\n","11438:  Climate is always changing, even without human influence, as evidenced by past ice ages.\n","11439:  However, emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere are creating significant global climate warming that is superimposed on the _natural_ rate of change.\n","11440:  Moreover this anthropogenic (or humanly-modified) warming, and the changes associated with it, is occurring very quickly.\n","11441:  The long-term trend of global climate warming can be clearly seen, even though the weather will continue to vary from one place and time to another.\n","11442:  Climate Change and Your Community 9 Table 1 identifies some of the climate changes that have already occurred,

underway to curb greenhouse gas emissions, but unless concerted action happens soon, further and more extreme changes may become unavoidable.\n","12067:  More intense and frequent rain and wind storms are anticipated, and sea level rise will pose a significant challenge by mid-century.\n","12068:  Adaptation refers to actions taken to respond to the impacts of climate change by taking advantage of opportunities, or reducing the associated risks.\n","12069:  there is significant overlap between climate change adaptation, mitigation and sustainability measures including those designed to improve greenspace, foster urban agriculture and facilitate improvements in buildings and urban infrastructure.\n","12070:  Adaptation more explicitly engages a wider range of issues, particularly emergency management, health and the needs of vulnerable populations in a changing climate.\n","12071:  Many existing City actions are already forwarding adaptation, and the focus of the Climate Change Adaptation Strategy is to build on these actions and propose new _no regret_ actions _ those that benefit the community regardless of the extent of climate change we eventually experience.\n","12072:  Strategy development began last spring and loosely followed the iCLei _Changing Climate, Changing Communities_ guide.\n","12073:  the first step included working with the pacific Climate impacts Consortium at UVic to acquire a detailed understanding of anticipated changes to the regional climate.\n","12074:  Using these climate projections, impacts to the City were identified through interviews with general managers and working group meetings.\n","12075:  impacts were prior- itized through a risk and vulnerability assessment, and adaptation actions were devised and evaluated through staff workshops.\n","12076:  the Adaptation Steering Committee provided final review and comment on the Strategy.\n","12077:  implementation of the Strategy will be the responsibility of department staff with coordination and support from the Sustainability group.\n","12078:  the Strategy includes primary and supporting actions which are all detailed in a matrix in Appendix A, including accountability and priority.\n","12079:  proposed actions were evaluated based on their effectiveness; overlap with sustainability and mitigation goals; cost-benefit ratio; and time horizon for anticipated impacts.\n","12080:  they are prioritized into the categories of _must do_, _monitor_ and _investigate further_, with capital planning cycle integration for _must do_ items.\n","12083:  the Strategy is a living document and will continue to be revised and updated as climate change science and adaptation practice evolve.\n","12084:  As this is the first Adaptation Strategy for Vancouver, many of the proposed actions focus on increasing our understanding of coming challenges and integrating climate change into planning, design and emergency management.\n","12085:  1 the Strategy is a living document and will continue to be revised and updated as climate change science and adaptation practice evolves.\n","12086:  As this is the first Adaptation Strategy for Vancouver, many of the proposed actions focus on increasing our understanding of coming challenges and integrating climate change into planning, design and emergency management.\n","12087:  Successive iterations of the Strategy will yield more detailed actions.\n","12088:  Many adaptation activities are already in place at the City driven by the need to manage observed climate changes, or to meet sustainability imperatives such as water conservation.\n","12089:  this Strategy takes a _no regrets_ approach to climate policy by identifying actions that build on these existing activities to improve community resiliency and generate benefits whether the extent of anticipated climate change materializes or not.\n","12090:  the Strategy begins with an overview and context for adaptation in Vancouver including adaptation basics and Vancouver_s future climate (chapters one to three).\n","12091:  Chapter four focuses on understanding the impacts and the cross- cutting issues they represent.\n","12092:  Chapter five identifies the primary and supporting actions with a companion comprehensive action matrix located in Appendix A.\n","12093:  A brief description of plan implementation and maintenance procedures conclude the plan.\n","12094:  iNTrODuCTiON ClimaTE ChaNGE iS clearly supported by both observed trends and peer reviewed scientific research.\n","12095:  Some climate change is now inevitable and there is evidence the world over that changes are already taking place.\n","12096:  global mitigation efforts are underway to curb greenhouse gas emissions, but unless concerted action happens soon, further and more extreme changes may become unavoidable.\n","12097:  preparing for these changes _adapting to climate change _ is a warranted and complementary strategy.\n","12098:  the City of Vancouver is a recognized leader in climate change mitigation, and adding adaptation to our business will ensure that we can continue to meet City goals cost effectively over time.\n","12100:  More intense and frequent rain and wind storms are anticipated and sea level rise will pose a significant challenge by mid-century.\n","12102:  Without action, these risks threaten a wide spectrum of City goals from economic prosperity to liveability.\n","12103:  Vancouver is joining a group of leading cities in europe, Australia and the United States that have developed and implemented climate change adaptation actions.\n","12104:  Vancouver_s Adaptation Strategy is a priority action in both the greenest City plan and the Corporate Strategic Business plan.\n","12105:  the City joined the iCLei Climate Change Adaptation initiative pilot in late 2010 along with a cohort of local and regional governments across Canada.\n","12106:  participants work through iCLei_s five milestone methodology with the goal of developing and implementing a climate change adaptation strategy over two years.\n","12107:  this Adaptation Strategy focuses on understanding the climate impacts today and how they are expected to change in the coming century.\n","12108:  it provides a framework for identifying and prioritizing vulnerabilities and risks and then exploring measures to reduce the risk imposed by climate impacts.\n","12109:  it will guide development of policies and programs to build resiliency into everyday operations and short and long-term infrastructure investments.\n","12110:  Accountability for the actions lies primarily with the City but also with external partners.\n","12112:  2 ViSion, PrinCiPleS anD goalS Strategy ViSion: to ensure that Vancouver remains a liveable and resilient city, maintaining its values, character and charm in the face of climate change.\n","12113:  guiDing PrinCiPleS: _ Use the best science available at the time of planning and review regularly.\n","12114:  _ promote flexible and adaptive management approaches that leave a range of future options available.\n","12115:  _ give priority to adaptation strategies that build on existing programs or policies and provide co-benefits with mitigation and sustainability goals.\n","12116:  _ Aim for integration into department business, _mainstreaming_, versus entirely new-staffed projects.\n","12117:  _ establish and maintain strong networks with First nations and other levels of government as well as with partners such as the port, the Board of trade and the Vancouver economic Commission.\n","12118:  _ Adaptation efforts should be mindful of, and include, planning to meet the unique needs and conditions of people who are most vulnerable.\n","12119:  goalS: development and implementation of this strategy will: _ increase the resilience of City infrastructure, programs and services to anticipated local climate change impacts.\n","12120:  _ promote and facilitate the incorporation of climate change information into City business.\n","12121:  _ improve awareness, knowledge, skills and resources of City staff.\n","12122:  _ enhance opportunities for coordination and cooperation through the development of networks and partnerships.\n","12123:  3 CHApter 1 aDaPtation in VanCouVer 1.1 mitigation anD aDaPtation ClimaTE ChaNGE miTiGaTiON refers to the ongoing attempts to prevent significant climate change through the reductions of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\n","12124:  the City of Vancouver has been a leader in mitigation for over a decade.\n","12125:  in 1990, the Clouds of Change task force was created by Council to study issues related to atmospheric change.\n","12126:  one of their recommendations was to study adaptive measures and begin planning long- term measure to adapt to possible consequences of climate change.\n","12127:  in 2003, the Cool Vancouver task force connected government, industry, citizens and non-government organizations working toward the common goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in Vancouver.\n","12128:  the greenest City Action team, charged with making Vancouver the greenest city in the world by 2020, was formed in 2009. the resulting greenest City plan, released in July, 2011, includes mitigation actions and an action directing development of an adaptation strategy under the Climate Leadership goal.\n","12129:  mitigation prevent climate change aDaPtation respond to the impacts of climate change figure 1: mitigation and adaptation to Climate Change the City of Vancouver_s mitigation commitment is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the community by 33% below 2007 levels by 2020. the reduction pathways identified include energy efficient buildings, district energy, transportation and vehicle changes, reduced landfill waste and clean electricity.\n","12130:  Adaptation refers to actions taken to respond to the impacts of climate change by taking advantage of opportunities or reducing the associated risks.\n","12132:  Mitigation and adaptation are not mutually exclusive, with many actions contributing to both goals.\n","12135:  integration of the Adaptation Strategy with greenest City plan actions was completed in development of this strategy.\n","12136:  1.2 role of loCal goVernment in aDaPtation it is widely recognized that adaptation is most effective at the regional and community scale.\n","12137:  exposure to hazards, vulnerability, adaptive capacity and risk are all place-based in nature and many of the impacts anticipated from climate change will affect the services and infrastructure for which local governments have the primary responsibility.\n","12139:  Local governments also invest in capital projects and programs that are expected to serve the City over many decades.\n","12140:  given current replacement rates, new buildings will account for an equal or greater fraction of building stock within climate change timeframes.\n","12141:  the cost of no action, both from a future retrofit and public safety perspective, could be much higher than proactively planning infrastructure to be resilient to future climate.\n","12142:  the cost to build a new house, bridge or trans- mission line that is adapted to climate change for its lifecycle will only add 0% to 5% to

DefinitionS: adaptation: in human systems, adaptation is the process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects, in order to moderate harm or exploit beneficial opportunities.5 Adaptation is a function of Vulnerability and risk.\n","12156:  Vulnerability: is the degree to which a system is susceptible to, or unable to cope with a particular climate change impact.\n","12157:  it is a function of the character, magnitude and rate of climate variation to which a system is exposed; its sensitivity and its adaptive capacity.6 Vulnerability = exposure x Sensitivity x adaptive Capacity exposure and Sensitivity: are almost inseparable properties of a system (or community).\n","12158:  A coastal community like Vancouver is exposed to sea level rise while an okanagan community may be ex- posed to drought.\n","12159:  Sensitivity is the degree to which the system is affected.\n","12160:  At the municipal level, iCLei suggests assessing sensitivity by considering existing stresses that make a department sensitive and how much the performance or function of an area may be affected by a climate change impact.\n","12161:  adaptive Capacity: is similar to, or closely related to, a host of other commonly used concepts, including adaptability, coping ability, management capacity, stability, flexibility and resilience.\n","12163:  Adaptive capacity is context-specific and varies from community to community and among social groups and individuals, and over time.7 Vulnerability assessment: the process to prioritize climate change risks focusing on where we are the most susceptible.\n","12164:  Vulnerability is a key determinant of potential impacts and disasters.\n","12165:  For example, a heat wave can have very different impacts on distinctive populations depending on their vulnerability.\n","12166:  Climate Change risk: is a combined function of the probability of a hazard (an event with the potential to cause harm, e.g.\n","12167:  floods, droughts) occurring and the magnitude or severity of its potential consequences (injury, damage, loss of habitat etc.).\n","12168:  8 risk = likelihood (probability) x

study the climate are projecting further changes over the next decades.\n","12962:  Preparing for these changes and the impacts they will have on natural systems and human communities is usually called _climate change adaptation,_ and is the subject of this guide.\n","12963:  Understandably, much attention has been focused to date on _climate change mitigation,_ or efforts to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the atmosphere and help slow the rate of climate change.1 How- ever, no matter how successful we are at reducing GHG emissions, we still face climate change impacts linked to past and ongoing GHG emissions that will be present in the atmosphere for many years to come.\n","12964:  This means that both types of climate action are necessary: mitigation to avoid even more dangerous impacts, and adaptation to deal with the inevitable level of change that scientists advise we will continue to face for the next century or longer.\n","12965:  Preparing for Climate Change: An Implementation Guide for Local Governments in BC is designed to assist local government elected officials and staff, including planners, en- gineers, chief administrative officers, financial officers and others, to plan and act in ways that will make their communities more resilient to the impacts of climate change.\n","12966:  The effects of a changing climate vary and will continue to vary significantly from region to region in BC, from sea level rise and flooding in some areas to drought and increased risk of wildfire and invasive species in others.\n","12967:  Local governments can access information about regional climate change impacts in BC through Plan2Adapt http://pacificclimate.\n","12968:  org/tools-and-data/plan2adapt, the website specially developed for BC communities by the Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium based at the University of Victoria.\n","12969:  As well, a num- ber of publications and approaches have been developed to assist local governments in understanding the risks they face, how vulnerable they are, and how to set priorities for action.\n","12970:  This guide also provides a very brief overview of processes for assessing risk and vulnerability to climate change impacts and prioritizing actions, but it is expected that local governments will rely on other resources to guide them in these areas.\n","12971:  Appendix A offers information on further resources on all of these topics.\n","12972:  This resource identifies the tools that local governments can use to implement climate change adaptation strategies.\n","12973:  Preparing for and responding to climate change impacts will, in most communities, engage a wide range of existing local government services 1 Resources to help local governments reduce their GHG emissions can be found in the BC Climate Action Toolkit www.toolkit.bc.ca.\n","12974:  This guide identifies the tools that local governments can use to implement climate

transportation systems, infra- structure, emergency response planning and delivery, community services, corporate servi- ces and management, financial planning and asset management.\n","12977:  Wherever possible, this guide provides concrete examples, drawing on the growing experi- ence of local governments in BC, and also some examples from outside the province.\n","12979:  These benefits may assist local governments in developing a _business case_ for climate change adaptation action.\n","12980:  For example, using green infrastructure solutions like topsoil requirements, rain gar- dens, bioswales and other measures can provide greater resilience with respect to increased precipitation.\n","12981:  At the same time, in some instances they can also save local governments money as a result of the reduced life cycle costs associated with these measures compared to traditional pipe and drain infrastructure.\n","12982:  There is no one way to prepare for climate change, however there are emerging practices that can be followed or modified to fit local circumstances.\n","12983:  It is hoped that this guide will help local governments better understand the scope and nature of the challenge that a changing climate presents, and how they can use existing tools and resources to implement climate change adaptation strategies.\n","12984:  7 PREPARING FOR CLIMATE CHANGE: An Implementation Guide for Local Governments in British Columbia PARt 1 Understanding climate change adaptation setting the context: A chAnging climAte in Bc Climate is usually defined as the _average weather_ in a given location, over a period of time ranging from months up to thousands of years.\n","12985:  Temperature, precipitation, humidity, cloudiness, air pressure and wind are some of the aspects of climate that are measured.\n","12986:  _Climate change_ refers to a change in the mean state of the climate, or in climate variabil- ity, that persists for decades or longer.\n","12987:  Thus climate change can mean general warming in mean annual air temperature, or warmer winters, but also changes in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, including heat waves, heavy rain and snow storms, and drought.\n","12988:  The global climate has changed over long periods of time as a result of natural causes.\n","12989:  However, more recent and rapid climate change is being attributed to human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and land use changes.2 Historical measurements indicate that British Columbia_s climate has changed over the past century: average annual temperature increased by 0.6oC on the coast, 1.1oC in the interior and 1.7oC in northern BC.\n","12990:  Much of the warming was likely due to an increase in nighttime minimum temperatures.3 Lakes and rivers now become free of ice earlier in the spring, on average, and two large BC glaciers have each retreated by more than a kilometre.\n","12991:  The Fraser River discharges a larger share of its total annual flow sooner in the year, and has warmer water in summer.\n","12992:  Since the beginning of the 1900_s, average sea levels have risen by 4 to 12 centimeters along most of the coast, with maximum levels up 16 to 34 cm in the Vancouver area.\n","12994:  Extremely warm temperatures will become more frequent.\n","12995:  A warmer climate will result in more growing degree days and frost free days _ increasing the potential for plant growth.\n","12996:  At the same time, in winter, 2 Core Writing Team, Pachauri, R.K. and Reisinger, A.\n","12997:  ), Climate Change 2007 _

impact, but there is an important distinction between deciding not to act, and not acting because of inertia or failing to consider alternatives.9 A strategic, or planned approach to climate change adaptation has a number of key benefits for local governments: _ Greater opportunities for adopting measures that have co-benefits and align with other community goals can be explored; _ _ _ _ Time can be taken to evaluate and address potential insurance and liability issues arising from climate change impacts; Cost savings can be realized by considering climate change impacts in the regular maintenance/updating/renewal schedule of existing infrastructure and by planning for new infrastructure to avoid expensive upgrades later; Adaptation measures that have unintended adverse impacts are more likely to be avoided if they have been identified and evaluated in advance; Emergency needs can be identified and prioritized in advance of crises; _ Opportunities for cooperation with other governments and agencies can be explored; _ _ _ Communities can be consulted and engaged in developing and implementing responses; Steps can be taken to enhance the resilience of vulnerable ecosystems before environmental thresholds are reached; and Local governments can avoid committing to development patterns or development in areas that will pose significant risks for inhabitants over the longer term as a result of climate change impacts.\n","13062:  The table on the following pages is based on materials from Canada_s National Assessment for British Columbia and a format prepared for King

 Making a connection between local knowledge and higher-level scien- tific information will both enhance understanding of the impacts of a changing climate and help to engage the community in considering adaptation strategies.11 Uncertainty about the rate of climate change, and severity of impacts There are two main sources of uncertainty in scientific climate projections.\n","13095:  First, climate change is linked to the concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and future levels depend on how successful the global community is at reducing greenhouse gas emissions in coming years.\n","13096:  Second, scientists obtain information about future climate change from computer models of the global climate system, and these models, though sophisticated, may not fully reflect the intricacies of the climate system.\n","13097:  Despite the uncertainty in projections of future climate, most experts agree there is enough informa- tion for decisionmakers to start to prepare.\n","13098:  The uncertainty is not whether the climate is changing, but how rapidly.\n","13099:  It is important to view adaptation as a process; as new information becomes avail- able or

identifying and evaluating adaptation options After assessing risk and vulnerability, the next stage is to identify and evaluate com- munity adaptation options, strategies, and actions.\n","13107:  It should be emphasized that the scientific information about climate change in a region or local area will not in itself determine the action that needs to be taken.\n","13108:  As with any matter

to implement effective adaptation actions.12 Most practitioners and experts working in this field seem to agree that it is useful to con- sider how local government services and functions can continue to be delivered in the face of a range of plausible climate change outcomes.\n","13137:  As one commentator has observed, the question to ask is not _What are all the changes that will happen and how can we respond?_ but _What do we do, and how should we adjust that for the reality of climate change._ The idea is to integrate climate change adaptation into existing activities.13 Once they have assessed risk and vulnerability to impacts, it may be useful for local govern- ments to undertake a _capacity assessment._ This can look at adaptive capacity both from a broader community perspective, as well as with respect to the main institutional bodies in a community, including local government.\n","13138:  An example is the Atlin Adaptive Capacity As- sessment.14 In looking at ways to strengthen adaptive capacity, communities might want to consider how they responded to events in the past that were similar to those expected in the future, such as natural hazards like flooding or wildfire.\n","13139:  It is important to build on existing strengths and programs within the community.\n","13140:  Three related approaches that can help strengthen adaptive capacity across local gov- ernment are discussed below: _mainstreaming_ climate change adaptation into local government planning and decision-making; adaptive management, a way to incorporate innovation and responsiveness into planning and decision-making; and cooperating and collaborating.\n","13141:  mainstreaming _Mainstreaming_ adaptation means ensuring that planning and decision-making take climate change impacts and vulnerability assessment into account wherever relevant.\n","13142:  It puts in place an integrated response to a changing climate, assists in ensuring that op- portunities to address vulnerabilities are explored, and also helps to avoid policies and projects that have an adverse effect on adaptation because climate change impacts were not considered.\n","13143:  Mainstreaming will not happen overnight, but it is an open-ended process that can be improved over time.\n","13144:  COMMUNITY ADAPTATION PROJECT ATLIN ADAPTIVE CAPACITY ASSESSMENT MARCH 2011 The Atlin Climate Change

the relevant climate information in a form that can be used by local government staff and decisionmakers; _ Developing adequate knowledge and understanding of climate change impacts on the part of local government land use and financial planners, engineers and decisionmakers in relation to their areas of responsibility.\n","13152:  This will likely mean consulting with climate scientists and other scientific and technical specialists who have relevant expertise; _ _ _ Creating appropriate triggers in planning and decision-making processes _ for example, including climate change impacts on development checklists, or having a certain level of investment in infrastructure trigger a requirement that any climate change impacts be considered in the context of infrastructure vulnerabilities.\n","13153:  Even where climate change impacts have already been identified, these types of triggers are important to ensure that current measures are periodically reassessed in the context of updated climate science; Carrying out robust community consultation processes so that businesses, households, individuals and community groups understand the basic science and will participate to some degree in developing and implementing adaptation strategies; and Cooperating and collaborating with other local governments, provincial and federal governments, government agencies, First Nations, and local associations to access adequate resources and capacity to assess climate change impacts and implement effective responses.\n","13154:  PREPARING FOR CLIMATE CHANGE:

plan to revise policies on a regular basis using updated information about per- formance as well as about external circumstances that affect performance.\n","13155:  It is sometimes referred to as _learning by doing._ Adaptive management was developed to accommodate the complexity and uncertainty associated with natural systems.\n","13156:  It may be a useful approach to help better meet management objectives over time in the context of a changing climate.\n","13157:  For adaptive management to work, practical and contextual information needs to flow to man- agers that are designing policies so that guidance for operational-level decisions can be improved.\n","13158:  For example, in terms of climate change, as more information about climate change impacts be- comes available, this could be used to adjust and refine policies.\n","13159:  Adaptive management is already being applied in the development of green infrastructure.\n","13160:  While the expected performance of

have a lot to consider in order to ensure that their communities are prepared for climate change.\n","13184:  The good news is that a number of BC local governments have already begun to take action to address the impacts of a changing climate, and local governments that are just getting started have a growing number of examples to consult.\n","13185:  The information that is provided in this

to future climate change impacts raises questions about capacity and vulnerability, patterns of development and green infrastructure options, costs of maintenance, operation, upgrading and replacement, options for financing, and operations during emergencies.\n","13203:  Some communities have found it useful to develop a climate change adaptation committee or team that can explore how to identify and manage climate change impacts and responses across a local government.\n","13204:  Building communities that are resilient in the face of future changes will require internal cooperation and collaboration in addition to the external collaboration described in Part 1.\n","13205:  In terms of adaptation strategies themselves, several themes emerge from practices and experience to date: _ _ _ Approaches that maintain and enhance the interconnectedness of communities with natural systems _ low impact development, green infrastructure for rainwater management, protecting ecological values within urban boundaries _ seem to offer increased resilience to a changing climate as well as important co-benefits; Strategies that emphasize more efficient use of resources and operation of equipment and facilities are also important for improving resilience where the impacts of climate change may result in shortages of resources such as energy or water, or increased demands on infrastructure during extreme weather event; and The need to adapt to a changing climate points towards regional scale responses in certain areas: for example, watershed management, food security and emergency planning and response.\n","13206:  All of these themes are illustrated with references to examples from BC and in some cases elsewhere in Canada.\n","13207:

ways to support action: _ When a local government has already assessed its risks and vulnerabilities to climate change impacts, or is prepared to undertake this process together with a significant revision of its OCP, there is the possibility to address climate change adaptation comprehensively across the policies and objectives within the OCP, and mainstream associated action throughout all guidelines and regulations; or _ _ For local governments that are just beginning to look at climate change impacts and the risks and vulnerabilities in their community, and have limited resources, the OCP can be used to frame specific climate change adaptation objectives to advance climate change assessment and planning, and/or to modify specific policies and objectives to incorporate adjustments to climate change impacts where there is enough existing information to do so; or For local governments that develop stand-alone plans the OCP will need to be amended to include the appropriate

view of legal liability.\n","13780:  Liability for local governments in the context of climate change impacts is most likely to arise in the form of claims against the local government for negligence or nuisance.\n","13781:  A local government can be found to be negligent if it can be shown that, in exercising its powers, it failed to exercise reasonable care towards people to whom it owes a duty of care.42 A key consideration is whether the harm in question was reasonably foreseeable.43 While there is still some degree of uncertainty associated with future climate change, the scientific evidence and related information that is now available make a range of climate change impacts increasingly foreseeable for local governments.\n","13782:  Accordingly it is becom- ing less likely that a local government would be able to successfully defend a negligence claim if it failed to take those impacts into account when exercising its statutory authority.44 Local governments can also be exposed to nuisance claims, which are based on an inter- ference with the use or enjoyment of private property.45 A typical example is where a local government sewerage or drainage system fails and causes property damage.\n","13783:  With climate change posing increasing challenges for local government infrastructure, there may be more nuisance claims of this type arising.\n","13784:  42 While the courts have made a distinction between policy and operational decisions, holding that only operational decisions attract liability, this is a relatively complex area of law and the subject of

pending on local weather patterns, natural features, settlement patterns, economic activities and other factors.\n","13862:  Local governments can help prepare their communities for climate change impacts over both the short and long term by making sure that decisions about land use in their jurisdictions take these impacts into account.\n","13863:  This can be accomplished most effectively by integrating climate change adaptation into existing regulatory tools and policies.\n","13864:  What is new about climate change adaptation is the need to look at longer term horizons, and to add climate experts and additional public consultation to existing planning processes.\n","13866:  To be effective, adaptation strategies need to be integrated across local government areas of responsibility and service, and mainstreamed into practice.\n","13867:  It is important for local governments to recognize that the uncertainty associated with climate change, as well as the need to fully consider the consequences of climate change impacts in their communities will necessarily make local government analysis and decision-making more involved than in the past.\n","13868:  Three land use scenarios that look at land use planning in the context of climate change are provided below: 1.\n","13869:  Mainstreaming climate change adaptation into land use planning _ Example: District of Elkford 2.\n","13870:  Incorporating climate science about natural hazards into land use planning _ Example: City of Prince George 3.\n","13871:  Using innovative tools to engage the community in

mAinstReAming climAte chAnge AdAPtAtion into lAnd use PlAnning One way for a community to be more prepared for a changing climate is to _mainstream_ climate change adaptation into key community planning documents such as the Official Community Plan (OCP).\n","13872:  The OCP is a forward-looking document prepared by local governments that sets out over- arching policies and objectives that apply to land use and development within their jurisdictions.\n","13873:  Once the OCP has been adopted in a bylaw, all other bylaws must be consistent with the OCP, such as land use and zoning bylaws, for example.\n","13874:  The OCP also creates development permit areas (DPAs) where specified guidelines for development must be followed.\n","13876:  Some local governments that have developed or revised their OCPs in recent times have begun to expand the timeline covered by the OCP beyond the five- or 10-year planning horizon that has previously been more typical.\n","13877:  It is possible to consider timelines of 50_100 years.\n","13878:  This recognizes that decisions about land use, for example, have long term impacts in a community and can benefit from a long term vision.\n","13879:  This approach is very compatible with preparing for the impacts of climate change, which may also be gradual, but significant over the longer term.\n","13880:  For example, it is important that planning protect the community in areas that may be subject to increased risks of flooding or sea level rise over the longer term as a result of climate change.\n","13881:  Using an OCP to help mainstream climate change adaptation into land use planning by a local gov- ernment is more likely to be successful when climate change adaptation is fully integrated into the OCP, and the process and the product linked to different policy areas and objectives.\n","13882:  It may be useful to discuss climate change adaptation in the opening section of the OCP, to indicate that it is a priority across all relevant policies and objectives contained in the OCP.\n","13883:  A stand-alone section with climate change adaptation goals and policies can provide additional direction.\n","13884:  Source: District of Elkford WILDFIRES Elkford Impacts and Opportunities 82 PREPARING FOR CLIMATE CHANGE: An Implementation Guide for Local Governments in British Columbia Another critical part of the mainstreaming process is educating local government councils or boards, staff and the community about the projected climate change impacts in their community, and having them motivated to develop responses and able to implement them.\n","13885:  The consultation undertaken as part of the process to revise or develop a new OCP needs to be broadened to include education around climate change projections, impacts and strategies, and to include access to cli- mate scientists and local experts.\n","13886:  Example: District of Elkford Official Community Plan 20101 In 2008, the District of Elkford, a small mountain town in the Eastern Kootenays, was undertaking a revision of its OCP.\n","13887:  The District decided to integrate climate change adaptation planning

Impacts Consortium, and used this information to gather fur- ther scientific information about how Elkford and region could be affected by climate changes.\n","13889:  The next step was to develop _impact pathways_ showing the chain of impacts that could result from climate change and how Elkford could be affected.\n","13890:  These impact pathways helped to illustrate how many different departments and service areas within Elkford would be affected, and that they all needed to be involved in evaluating impacts and developing responses.\n","13891:  Results were presented to the community, and three priority areas were identified: wildfire, flooding/stormwater management, and water supply.\n","13892:  This was followed by a vulnerability and risk assessment, and then action planning to develop an adaptation strategy.\n","13893:  The consultation undertaken by Elkford was significantly more extensive than what would have been considered typical for the development of an OCP.\n","13894:  It was felt that this was important for building understanding and acceptance in the community and on council for integration of climate change adaptation into the OCP.\n","13895:  Some of the outreach activities included displays at the mall that included a quick survey, a paper and web-based survey, facilitated kitchen table meetings, and an open house that was attended by members of the community as well as a number of current and local council candidates running for election.\n","13896:  The Elkford OCP explicitly references the integration of the climate change adaptation strategy for the community into that document, and notes that the OCP __guides development for at least the next 10-20 years and effectively addresses sound science regarding future changes in local weather patterns and climatic variables in the District._2 The Elkford OCP defines climate change adaptation and integrates adaptation goals and objectives throughout the plan, across nearly all areas of policy and decision-making.\n","13898:  The Elkford OCP also lists bylaws and other District plans and processes that need to be updated and harmonized with the OCP, as well as proposing a number of new actions and studies that would assist in implementing the OCP and achieving climate change adaptation goals.\n","13899:  Specific monitoring and evaluation of climate change adaptation in the District is also identified as necessary.\n","13900:  84 PREPARING FOR CLIMATE CHANGE: An Implementation Guide for Local Governments in British Columbia lAnd use scenARio 2: incoRPoRAting

property in the face of natural hazards.\n","13901:  Some of the projected climate change impacts for BC, which vary by region, that may be relevant for local governments to consider in relation to natural hazards include:3 _ _ _ _ _ _ Increased risk of wildfires; Increased risk of flooding; Increased risk of landslides on steep slopes; Sea level rise; Increased incidence of invasive species; and Increased incidence of extreme storm events.\n","13902:  To prepare for natural hazards in the context of climate change, local governments need to obtain the climate information relevant for their region, quantify risk and assess their vulnerabilities, and then determine appropriate responses.\n","13903:  Local governments can obtain information about projected climate impacts for their regions from Plan2Adapt, by contracting specifically with the Pacific Cli- mate Impacts Consortium, by working with BC universities, through reviewing scientific literature, by enhancing staff capacity through training and collaboration, by hiring technical consultants, and other sources.\n","13904:  Applying the information about local risks and vulnerabilities to land use planning is in some ways very similar to conventional planning for natural hazards by local governments: land use needs to be determined so that the risks faced by different geographic areas within the community are accept- able in terms of the type of development and permitted uses in that area.\n","13905:  Where risks are inevitable, planning needs to ensure that emergency responses can be carried out as effectively as possible and that key infrastructure functioning is maintained.\n","13906:  What is different about preparing for climate change is that assessments of risk and vulnerability based on historical events will not be good predictors of the risks faced in future, unless they factor in climate change projections.\n","13907:  As well, risks and vulnerabilities should be periodically reassessed to incorporate evolving and updated information about climate change impacts.\n","13908:  3 The risks related to natural hazards associated with climate change will be different for every region, and each local government should assess its own risks and vulnerabilities, incorporating climate information from sources such as Plan2Adapt http://pacificclimate.org/tools-and-data/plan2adapt 85 PREPARING FOR CLIMATE CHANGE: An Implementation Guide for Local Governments in British Columbia Example: City of Prince George Prince George is a northern BC community that faces significant impacts associated with a changing climate.\n","13909:  It is located at the confluence of the Nechako and Fraser, with significant development within the floodplain.\n","13910:  It is also surrounded by forests that have been severely affected by mountain pine beetle.\n","13911:  The Nechako River has historically been subject to ice jams that can cause flooding in Prince George.\n","13912:  In the winter of 2007/2008 there was a 35 km long ice jam that caused extensive flooding.4 Prince George is also in a region affected by the mountain pine beetle epidemic, and both surrounding forested lands and trees within municipal boundaries have been damaged.\n","13913:  Faced with questions and potential challenges related to climate change, Prince George has been working with the Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium and researchers from the University of North- ern BC5 to assess the climate change impacts faced by the City, and to develop adaptation priorities.\n","13914:  Over the next 50 years, annual temperatures in Prince George are projected to increase by 1.6_C to 2.5_C, and precipitation is projected to increase by 3% to 10%.\n","13915:  The changes are expected to be more dramatic in winter, and more precipitation is expected to fall as rain.\n","13916:  The result is likely to be more flooding and more extreme events such as wildfires, windstorms and extreme precipitation events.6 Based on these projections Prince George has been taking action to explore and address flooding and wildfire risks.\n","13917:  In 2009 Prince George hired technical consultants to prepare a flood risk evaluation that included cli- mate change projections.\n","13918:  While a number of flood control options were identified for Prince George, including enlarging existing side channels, building dikes and flood-proofing buildings, changing land use in flood prone areas was found to be a potentially cost-effective solution in certain cir- cumstances.\n","13919:  Public consultation about flood control options demonstrated that there was public support for proactive measures, largely because of the extensive damage that Prince George had experienced in past flood events.\n","13920:  In 2011 Prince George adopted a new Flood Plain Regulation Bylaw Downstream view of the Nechako River during winter 2007/08 showing the ice-related flooding of the industrial area

periodically reviewed and updated.7 As a result of the mountain pine beetle epidemic, Prince George has been working to adapt to the impacts of climate change in its forest management and operations for more than a decade.\n","13928:  Since 2006 it has had a Community Forest Agreement with the provincial government, which has allowed it to manage areas of forested Crown land within City limits.\n","13929:  The City has engaged in fuel treatment activities including salvage harvesting and thinning operations to reduce wildfire hazards, and has funded these activities through grants from NRCAN and UBCM.\n","13930:  Prince George has also developed a Community Wildfire Protection Plan that includes measures such as guidelines for new develop- ments, identifying fire hazard areas and public education.8 While it has been an early leader in climate change adaptation at the local government level, Prince George is continuing to develop and implement strategies to address the changing climate.\n","13931:  7 8 Ibid.\n","13932:  A short video about Prince George_s climate adaptation actions with respect to flooding is found here:

scenARio 3: using innovAtive tools to engAge the community in undeRstAnding And ResPonding to climAte chAnge Robust community engagement in developing and implementing climate change adaptation strat- egies is important, because some of the responses will require significant investment of tax dollars and local government resources.\n","13933:  Citizens and elected officials will need to have a basic understand- ing of the climate change projections and impacts in their communities so that they can make informed decisions.\n","13934:  There may also be cases where priorities with respect to land uses are at issue.\n","13935:  In areas subject to increased risks with respect to natural hazards as a result of climate change, for example, a community might need to weigh the costs and benefits of protection versus relocation.\n","13936:  However, the implications of climate change at the local level can be complex, and challenging for communities to understand.\n","13937:  The Collaborative for Advanced Landscape Planning at the University of British Columbia9 has developed an innovative visioning tool that has proven effective in helping communities to under- stand the impacts of climate change in their region, to appreciate the urgency in certain cases, and to prioritize actions.\n","13938:  The tool brings together climate data with visual representations of local geography and neighbourhoods, and allows community members to see vivid representations of potential climate impacts.\n","13940:  The tool has been used in interactive public settings in a number of BC communities, and has received very positive feedback from community members.\n","13941:  There is a guidance manual for the tool for BC local governments that is available free of charge.\n","13942:  The tool can be used with existing planning resources including Google Earth, GIS and CommunityViz capabilities.10 Three additional training modules for the use of the tool are being developed.\n","13943:  Example: City of Kimberley The City of Kimberley in southeastern BC is a small community that relies on tourism and outdoor recreation.\n","13944:  It faces potential climate change impacts that include flooding, wildfire, water supply issues, and others.\n","13945:  As part of the Kimberley Climate Adaptation Project supported by the Columbia Basin Trust, Kim- berley worked with CALP to pilot a climate change visioning process, that _use[d] tools such as GIS mapping and 3D visualizations to localize, spatialize and visualize climate change impacts and solutions._11 In particular, the visualizations gave community members the opportunity to ask _what if_ questions and see the outcomes modeled before them.\n","13946:  9 With support from the Ministry

Implementation Guide for Local Governments in British Columbia The mapping and visualizations that were produced included vulnerabilities to wildfire and flood- ing.\n","13948:  Options for reducing vulnerabilities or adapting to changes were also provided.\n","13949:  A summary of the visualizations was presented to an open house in Kimberley.\n","13950:  The strongest audience response came from the virtual fire tour which situated the projected forest fire season extension under climate change within a localized _fire story_.\n","13951:  First, a 3D historical fire map showed the last 100 years of fires around Kimberley.\n","13952:  Further mapping displayed in the virtual globe illustrated that the forest ecosystems around Kimberley are both fire-dependent, and heavily fuel-loaded due to fire suppression.\n","13953:  Then, fire modeling results for a simulated current forest fire that starts southwest of the City were shown: each hour of the fire was layered on the virtual landscape in a time sequence, showing the fire cutting off the Highway access in three hours and reaching the City of Kimberley in four hours.\n","13954:  The audience visibly responded by sitting up and there was an audible intake of breath in the room.\n","13955:  The virtual tour then illustrated how the fire season could extend under climate change: currently starting in May, it could be starting as early as mid-March by the 2040s, and mid-February by the 2080s.\n","13956:  Again, the time slider in Google Earth was used to show the possible future shift, and again the audience visibly and audibly reacted as they absorbed the information.12 Surveys conducted among attendees following the Open House indicated that the visualizations had been useful in helping people to understand the link between climate change and land use decisions.\n","13957:  Reduction of wildfire risk and a fuel treatment program were among the recommended actions in the report prepared for the

CLIMATE CHANGE: An Implementation Guide for Local Governments in British Columbia APPendix c Developing Climate Change adaptation Strategies: Checklist for local governments The purpose of this checklist is to assist local governments in exploring the entry points for integrat- ing climate change adaptation into policy and operations, as well as the scope of responsibilities that may be affected.\n","13960:  It is meant to trigger further investigation and discussion about adaptation options and strategies.\n","13961:  Occasional references to further resources are included.\n","13962:  Because adaptation is an ongoing process, many of these questions will ideally be revisited over time.\n","13963:  This checklist is meant to be a practical supplement to the information provided in Part 1 of this guide, and to help local governments move to the stage where they are ready to implement climate change adaptation strategies as discussed in Part 2.\n","13964:  As described in Part 2, the Official Community Plan (OCP) will be one of the main tools used to imple- ment adaptation strategies, together with a number of local government bylaw powers and other activities that can be used to make communities more resilient to a changing climate.\n","13965:  However, prior to updating an OCP it is important to start assessing potential climate change impacts, as well as options for addressing impacts based on community vulnerability, resources, capacity, local context and other factors.\n","13966:  Even where local governments have limited resources available for climate change adaptation, there are ways to begin preparing, as described in Appendix D _ Considerations for Local Governments with Limited Resources.\n","13967:  While efforts have been made to include as many useful questions as possible, the checklist is not exhaustive.\n","13968:  Extra space has been provided so that users can add their own questions.\n","13969:  There will be overlap among the topic areas set out below.\n","13970:  A good way to start a review of the check- list is to establish an inter-departmental committee, have a meeting, and go through the questions together in order to explore different viewpoints and start to understand the linkages.\n","13971:  It is also use- ful to review the questions for each of the different types of impacts and to ask _what if__ questions.\n","13972:  90 PREPARING FOR CLIMATE CHANGE: An Implementation Guide for Local Governments in British Columbia MAKING THE MOsT OF THE CHECKLIsT: uNdERsTANdING CLIMATE

operations might be affected by climate change.\n","13981:  The questions below are aimed at helping local governments begin to work through this process, and explore some of the options for adapting.\n","13982:  It is important to plan for multiple events, e.g.\n","13983:  unusually high temperatures and power outages.\n","13984:  See Appendix A: Further resources for help with assessing risks and vulnerability.\n","13985:  Note: Understanding that the past will no longer be a good predictor of the future is a key part of adapting to climate change.\n","13986:  Local government staff and elected repre- sentatives will need to be aware of the _new normal_: the climate of the future will be different than the climate of the past.\n","13987:  For example, extreme weather events such as heat waves, drought and storms may become more frequent and more severe.\n","13988:  Flooding and wildfires may be more frequent or extensive, or both, than previously experienced.\n","13989:  As a consequence, it is important to recognize that what worked in the past to address these types of challenges will not necessarily work for the future.\n","13990:  91 PREPARING FOR CLIMATE CHANGE: An

likely has a low vulnerability to coastal erosion.\n","14230:  By contrast, a community with low-elevation coastal areas may be extremely vulnerable if faced with the same risk.\n","14231:  Review land use development patterns, locations of key facilities (e.g.\n","14232:  hospitals, emergency facilities, works yards etc.\n","14233:  ), transportation/ emergency routes and check for
