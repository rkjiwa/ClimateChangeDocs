From these changes, \n\nresources, watershed health, and community \nhealth and sustainability.\nCommunities rely on water and watersheds for \nseveral immeasurable values including:  A safe, secure, and adequate supply of water \n for domestic, agricultural, commercial, industrial, \n recreational and tourism uses;\n  \nA receiving environment for wastewater \ndischarges; \n  \nProvision of ecosystems services including \n\n sedimentation processes;\n  \nA host of other social, cultural, economic and \nspiritual values.Planning plays a critical role in how communities \n \nachieve that vision. Planning can be reactive or \nresponsive, helping to make course corrections \nin response to existing issues and challenges. It \ncan also be proactive in anticipating emerging \nissues on the horizon and helping communities to prepare for and manage those issues. When \nit comes to communities and watersheds, there \nmay be as many different approaches to planning, \nas there are communities. \nHowever, there are many common principles, \npractices and desired outcomes across the \nspectrum of different planning processes used in \nBC and beyond. These are discussed in further \ndetail in the sections that follow. \nSection 2 of this guide provides an overview of \nplanning for water and watersheds. The rationale \n\nare described, and examples of the desired \n\nguidelines for designing a planning process are \ndescribed as well as some general challenges and \nopportunities associated with watershed planning \nprocesses. Ten different planning processes are \n\n\nlater sections of the guide (5, 6, 7). See section \n8 for a more detailed discussion about several \nconcepts that are relevant to planning for water \nand watersheds, including integrated watershed \nplanning, water centric planning, design with \nnature and the soft path approach.\nSection 3 provides general information about \nthe impacts of climate change on water and watersheds in BC.

They will be better able to manage in the face of those pressures. \nFor example, population growth projections can inform the potential for growth in water \nuse and demand relative to available supply. Similarly, future climate scenarios can help \nusers understand if future water supplies might decrease. By exploring future climate, \npopulation, and development scenarios, planners can identify when water use might \nbe projected to exceed supply and can help make the case for water conservation \nand other strategies to contain demand within supply limits. There can also be public \n\nsupport in implementing plans and any associated strategies.The following section will explain what water and watershed planning is, why it is important, when it is needed and the range of options available in BC. Sections 5, 6 and 7 then describe in more detail the characteristics and requirements associated \nwith different planning options.\n A community vision for a sustainable watershed commonly includes one or more of \nthe following desired outcomes:\n  \nManaging water uses and rates of consumption within available water supplies \nseasonally, annually and over the long-term \n  \nDeveloping and managing water supplies in ways that do not compromise the health \n  \nManaging the allocation of water in ways that support a variety of high-value water \nuses, including human consumptive and non-consumptive uses as well as instream, \nenvironmental uses \n Supporting a wide variety of economic development activities \n  Managing wastewater discharges within the capacity of receiving waters to absorb \nand assimilate those wastes  Supporting renewable energy sources while minimizing impacts on the environment\n  \nManaging human development patterns in ways that stabilize rather than destabilize \nthe hydrologic cycle\n  \nManaging development in ways that reduce rather than increase the vulnerability of \n\n  \nMaintaining and strengthening community resiliency and preparedness for change, \nincluding changes in climatePlanning can be reactive and responsive to longstanding issues and challenges.

These in turn contribute to a variety of impacts on communities \nand ecosystems. Scientists project that more changes will come. Identifying, \nunderstanding and preparing for these changes (sometimes referred to as climate \nchange ‚adaptation™) should become an important component, or a relevant lens to \napply, within water and watershed planning processes.\nIn sections 5, 6 and 7 of this guide the following approaches to planning for water \n\n Water Conservation Plans\n Drought Management Plans\n Water Use Plans\n Water Allocation Plans\n Well/Aquifer Protection Plans\n Drinking Water/Source Protection Plans\n Assessment Response Plans Water Management Plans (Water Act, Part 4)\n Watershed Management Plans\n  \nLiquid Waste/Integrated Stormwater \n Management PlansThe suitability of these plans for a community, \n\non the nature and scope of the issues that need to \nbe addressed.

Planning \ncan be initiated either through voluntary means or \nby regulation. According to the Canadian Institute of \n\nand orderly disposition of land, resources, facilities \nand services with a view to securing the physical, \n\nof urban and rural communities.2 The goals of planning are oriented towards the future. \nTherefore, planning is an ongoing, dynamic process \nthat needs to be attuned and adaptive to changing \nenvironmental conditions, social outlooks and \ncommunity visions. \nThe Planning ProcessApproaches used in planning processes vary greatly. \nSome processes follow a rigid schedule of meetings, \n\nThe approach selected is determined, in part, by the \n\nbeing addressed, the needs and interests of the \ncommunity, and the individuals involved. Planning for \ncomplex environmental, social or economic problems \ntypically requires a process design that integrates \nmost, if not all, of the following steps: 3, 45', '  \nInvolve key decision makers and partners. \nConsider who should be engaged in the process \nin order for it to work. Strong partnerships make \nfor a strong plan.\n  \nCharacterize the area / issue to identify problems. \n\nsolutions may be overlooked.  \nModel or analyze the situation or problem. It is \nimportant to understand the causes of the problem, \nas well as the dynamics that may help solve it.  \nSet goals and identify potential solutions, \nincluding resource requirements, and \nimplementation and feedback procedures.\n  Evaluate potential solutions in terms of technical \nfeasibility, cost effectiveness, probable effects \n and political acceptability  \nMake decisions and design an  implementation program.\n Implement solutions and take action.  \nMonitor and evaluate the success of the plan and \nits implementation. Modify the plan as required.\nPlanning with water in mind, or water centric planning, is a primary objective of Living Water \nSmart, British Columbia™s Water Plan. Historically, \nthe provincial government coordinated planning \nfor water resources. More recently, First Nations, \nlocal governments, stewardship groups and \nother community stakeholders have shared \nthis responsibility. Examples of collaborative \n\nthis guide. Living Water Smart advocates for \nwater and watershed planning to continue to be a shared, collaborative endeavour.\nThere is no absolute template to follow for water \nand watershed planning. Every planning process \nand every plan is different. There are, however, \nmany elements that are critical to the success of \nwatershed plans. With this in mind, recommended \nguidelines for watershed planning processes \ninclude the following: \n  Develop a clear vision, goals, objectives and action \nitems; and set priorities among these.  \nSeek involvement and support from elected \ndecision-makers and those with legislative or \nregulatory responsibilities. The relevant decision \nmakers have much to offer towards a plan that \ncan be implemented.  Ensure full representation of all affected parties, \nwhile keeping the size of the process workable. \n  \nEnsure that the planning process is understood, \nused and broadly supported.\n  \nProvide access to appropriate technical and \nanalytical skills and information resources.\n Obtain sustainable funding.  \nStrive for planning that is done before \n further development will undermine the \neffectiveness of the plan. \n  \nFactor in the impacts of climate change and \ninterception activities (e.g., farm dams and forestry) \n\n  \nInclude socio-economic analyses to \n inform planning.  \nConsult with those affected to improve the \nquality of decisions and build community \n\n  \nGive high priority to ensuring that the values and \ninterests of indigenous peoples are included.\n  \nDevelop capacity for learning and improving over \ntime and the ability to evaluate the process.\n  \nProvide adequate resources to develop \n and implement water plans and evaluate \n their outcomes.  \nImprove monitoring and compliance of the use \nof water and other watershed resources. \nIdeally, watershed plans and the organizations \ninvolved in implementing the plans should \nemerge from the planning process with:\n  \nImproved understanding of the watershed \n and how it functions  \nClear objectives of how to manage the water sustainably and in an integrated manner \nenvironmental outcomes\n  \nDecisions that are based on the best \n available information  \nAdequately resourced management \n and implementation  \nGood integration with other regional and \nresource-based plans\nIt should be acknowledged that planning would \nnot solve all of the water-related challenges \n\nimportant component of the management and \ngovernance of water resources and watersheds.\n2.3 AN INTRODUCTION TO WATERSHEDSEverything in the natural world is connected to \nother parts. Changes made to one element of \na system affect many other elements and/or \nprocess throughout the system. A watershedŠ\nan area of land that contributes runoff to a lake, \nriver, stream, estuary or bayŠis a complex \nand dynamic natural system. Changes to land \ncover in upland regions of a watershed affect \ndownstream hydrology; waste inputs from \none community can affect water quality further \ndownstream. Impacts to an aquifer, such as \n\nand health of a nearby stream. The various \nresources that interact within a watershedŠthe \nland, the surface and ground water, the air and \nthe organisms within the watershedŠcannot \nbe considered in isolation. By recognizing the \ninterconnections between the components of a \nwatershed and by integrating this understanding \ninto planning and decision making within and \nacross watershed boundaries, negative human \nimpacts on watershed health are more likely to \nbe more effectively managed. \n6', 'Understanding the hydrologic cycle is critical to understanding how \na watershed functions. While both salt water and freshwater are \nessential parts of the water cycle, the freshwater that we use on a \ndaily basis for drinking water, irrigation, andother uses comprises only \n1% of all water on Earth. This small proportion of water is ﬁrecycledﬂ \nthrough the hydrologic cycle, year after year, through oceans, rivers, \nrain and the atmosphere (Figure 1).\nWhen water falls to the earth as either rain or snow, it either:\n Soaks into the ground\n  Flows over the surface of the land into a stream, lake, \n wetland or the ocean, or \n Returns to the atmosphere through evaporation.\nfactors, including soil permeability, rate of precipitation and the \namount and type of vegetation cover on the land surface.

Some of the most familiar climate parameters are temperature, precipitation, humidity, \ncloudiness, and wind. Climate change refers to a change in the state of the climate which \npersists for a period of decades or longer. \n2   Climate change science suggests that by the middle of the century (2050s), mean annual temperatures across BC will be 1-3° C warmer on average. Extremely warm temperatures \nwill become more frequent. A warmer climate will increase growing degree days and frost \nfree days Œ increasing the potential for plant growth. In winter, most parts of BC will receive \nup to 20% more precipitation. In summer, northern BC will be up to 10% wetter, and \nsouthern BC will be up to 15% drier.

Therefore, we need to consider these impacts within water and watershed plans to \nstrengthen the ability of communities to manage such impacts. Projected changes are highly \ndependent upon location, topography, and watershed type. Some examples of impacts \nrelated to climate change are:\n \nwater users and between human consumption and water uses within the natural environment;\n  \nDegraded water quality, which may impact the suitability of water for drinking and for \nagricultural, commercial, industrial, recreational and environmental water uses; and\n \n\nimpact water supplies, drainage infrastructure, other critical infrastructure, public and \nprivate property, andŠin extreme circumstancesŠ human health.\nThese and other climate-related impacts will be discussed in more detail in Sections 3, 5, 6 \nand 7 of this guide, along with suggestions on how to integrate and address these issues \nwithin water and watershed plans. As expressed in Living Water Smart, British Columbia™s Water Plan,\nﬁwe need to design \nour communities to adapt to our changing climate while thinking long term to revitalize \nour natural systemsﬂ. At a 2008 conference \nof the BC Water and Waste Association, Jim \nMattison, former Assistant Deputy Minister, \nWater Stewardship Division, BC Ministry of \nEnvironment, spoke to water managers about the \ntwo responses to climate change: mitigation and \nadaptation.ﬁMitigation and adaptation are both \nnecessary and complementary strategies to cope \nwith the climate change challenge. If mitigation \n(alleviating the effects of climate change through \nreducing greenhouse gasses) is about carbon, \nthen adaptation (preparing for the changes that \noccur) is about waterﬂ. 4 While human systems \nwithin impacted watersheds ﬁmay adapt to climate \nchange, albeit at some cost, natural ecosystems \nand wildlife cannot adapt very quickly to a sudden, \nlarge change and hence are at risk.ﬂ\n 5  Climate change impacts on water resources, \nwatershed health, and communities are \nare expected to vary for different regions of \nthe province. Projected changes are highly \ndependent upon location, topography, and \nwatershed type. In general there are four different \ntypes of watersheds with different hydrological \nregimes, and differences in how these \nwatersheds are affected by climate change need \nto be considered within water, watershed, and/or \nadaptation planning: Rain-dominated watersheds Snow-dominated watersheds Transition watersheds\n  Coastal watersheds (rain and transition, but with \nadded the impact of sea level rise).The range of potential climate-related impacts on \nwater, watersheds and communities across BC \ninclude the following (see also setion 9.

The \nsections that follow provide additional information \n\ncontext of water and watershed planning.3.2.1 LEARNING ABOUT REGIONAL \nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPAC\nTSWhat are the impacts of climate change on water \nand watersheds in my region?\nInformation about climate change and its impacts \non water and watersheds in BC is available, \nalthough the amount and level of detail varies from \none region to another. \nInformation about changes in climate, changes in \nhydrology, and changes in aquatic and terrestrial \necosystems in BC during the past century is \navailable from reports published by the BC Ministry \nof Environment, Natural Resources Canada, and \n\nand Resources for links to key publications.\nThe planning tool Plan2Adapt provides a good \nstarting point for learning about future climate. \n It provides regionally relevant information about \nprojected climate for 2020s, 2050s, and 2080s, \nbased on a standard set of climate model \nprojections. It presents this information in the form \nof simple-to-understand maps, graphs and text.  \nUsers can view the information online as well as \ndownload material for use in presentations and \nreports. Users with more technical knowledge can \nalso download the data used to create the maps \nfor further analysis. See http://plan2adapt.ca/.It™s not enough to know what future climate will \nlook like. Equally important is to understand the \nimplications of future climate to future stream \n\nplanning region. Much of the existing information on \nthese topics is provincial in scope. There are only a \nfew regions Œ including the Okanagan, the Columbia \nBasin, and the Lower Mainland Œ for which detailed \ninformation on water and watersheds exists. Not \nall of the existing information is written in simple \nlanguage.  Section 9 Tools and Resources provides \nlinks to key sources of information about impacts on \nwater and watersheds.Where detailed local or regional information \nabout future climate or hydrology is not readily \nClimate Impacts Consortium, or by working with academic researchers and students.  \nWhile many communities believe they need accurate information about future climate and future \nimpacts on water and watersheds, in many cases general information about the direction of these \nimpacts will be adequate for initial planning purposes. The following information, for example, can \nguide water and watershed management decisions:  Whether or not regional snowpack (a low-cost water storage mechanism) \n will likely decrease in future;\n \n\n \n \n\n turbidity Œ are becoming more frequent.\n3.2.2 EXPLORING LOCAL AND REGIONAL VULNERABILITY \n TO CLIMATE CHANGEHow will the impacts of climate change affect water supply, demand, quality and watershed \nhealth in my region?\nScience alone cannot provide all the information water and watershed planners need to prepare \nfor climate change. In many cases it is local people who are in the best position to identify the \nwater and watershed values they care about, how sensitive those values are to year-to-year \nchanges in climate, and local capacity to address existing problems.\n\nof this guide) describe two types of assessment: vulnerability assessment and risk assessment. \n\npressures related to climate. Questions for water and watershed planners to consider in assessing \nvulnerability related to climate change are:\n  \nWhat aspects of climate are currently important to our water supply or our \n watershed? In particular, how have extreme weather events affected our water \n supply or watershed in the past?  \nGiven projected climate change and related impacts: Is the community water supply likely \n to increase or decrease? Is damage to water infrastructure likely to increase or decrease?\n  \nHow prepared is our community to projected changes? Are we resilient or vulnerable?\nIn many cases, climate change will exacerbate existing management challenges, such as \n\nthings that communities are already struggling to address.\n11', '3.2.3 EVA\nLUATING LOCAL AND REGIONAL RISK RELATED TO CLIMATE CHANGEWhat climate-related risks are priorities for my community in terms of the hazards \n and consequences? Many communities are familiar with risk assessment and risk management. \nPreparing for climate change can be approached as just another aspect of risk \n\ndrought, water contamination, landslide) occurring, and the consequences of \nexposure to that hazard. Communities can manage risk by reducing exposure to a \nhazard or by minimizing its consequences. \nSometimes climate change will introduce a new hazard (for example sea level rise, \nglacier loss), or a new consequence (for example new, invasive species). More often, \nclimate change will increase or decrease the likelihood that a hazard will occur.\nWater and watershed planners can use their knowledge of regional climate changes \nand its impacts to inform a basic risk assessment. Planners should also consider whether climate change presents new hazards or consequences relevant to water \nand watershed planning.3.2.4 IDENTIFYING CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES \nWhat are the most important short, medium and long-term strategies that my \ncommunity can implement to reduce the risks and impacts of climate change?\nOnce communities have a deeper understanding of past and future climate change, \npotential impacts, local vulnerabilities, and priority risks, they will be in a good position to identify, evaluate and select strategies that will minimize local or regional climate-\nrelated risks. Most of these strategies will look familiar.\nWhere climate change will likely reduce supply, communities can:\n  Develop water conservation and/or drought management plans.\n \n\n  \nExpand the storage capacity of existing water supplies.  \nDevelop new water supplies or retention structures.\nWhere climate change will have negative effects on Water Quality, communities can:\n  \nChange design capacity of drainage infrastructure such as storm sewers, catch basins, \nand erosion protection structures.\n  \nManage rainwater on-site to ease demands \n on drainage infrastructure.\n  \nWhere climate change will negatively affect Other Water and Watershed Values \ncommunities can: Protect wetlands and other sensitive habitats.\n Restore riparian and instream habitat.\nCurrently, there is no list of ﬁbest practicesﬂ for adaptation. This is because climate \nchange and its impacts vary from one location to another, and communities vary in \ntheir exposure and ability to cope. In addition, vision, values, risk tolerance, priorities, \nresources, and other factors vary from one community to another, so even those facing \nsimilar risks and opportunities may make different adaptation choices. Thus, while many \nadaptation options are theoretically possible, communities should evaluate to the extent \n\nthey wish to implement. \nWhere climate change exacerbates existing management challenges, such as water \n\nconsideration must be given to the degree to which climate change is compounding \n\nadditional pressures related to climate change. ﬁNo regretsﬂ actions that address both \ncurrent and future risk are particularly popular.\n12', '1  Centre for Indigenous Environmental Resources (2010).

The Province is \nthe lead jurisdiction for setting policy, legislating \nprices, permitting uses, and managing water sources in BC. Provincial jurisdiction includes \npublic lands, municipal institutions, local works and undertakings, non-renewable resources, \nproperty and civil rights, and shared jurisdiction \nover agriculture.\n1 Typically, the Province devolves \nthe responsibility of community-scale water \nmanagement to municipalities or other local organizations such as water suppliers. In British Columbia, the BC Water Act (administered by the \nMinistry Forests, Lands and Natural Resource \nOperations) and the Drinking Water Protection \nAct (administered by the Ministry of Health) \nprovide the basic regulatory framework for water \n\nmanagement. The following are some of the \nkey provincial roles and responsibilities in water \nmanagement and planning.Ministry of Environment (MoE)The MoE provides leadership for water \nstewardship and promotes responsible water \nuse, community health and safety, maintenance \nof terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, and other \npriorities. The Ministry applies a stewardship \napproach based on the principles of integrated \nwater resource management. The Ministry of \nEnvironment works in partnership with other \nagencies (such as the Ministry of Forests, Lands \n\nand Natural Resource Operations) to deliver this \nmandate and ensure the health of the province™s \nwater resource.

For \nexample, refer to: Federal Water Policy. The following are some of the key federal roles and \nresponsibilities in water management and planning:\nEnvironment Canada   \nOperates hydrometric, climate and water quality monitoring \n networks in partnership with the provincial ministry of environment; \n  \nUndertakes research on water quality and quantity, watershed \n management and climate change.Fisheries and Oceans Canada \n\nAboriginal Affairs & Northern Development Canada  \nManages water on indian reserves jointly with First Nation governments.\nHealth Canada  \nSets drinking water standards for canadians.\nAgriculture and Agri-Food Canada  \nConducts research and provides information on water use in \n agriculture and agricultural impacts on the water resource.\nTransport Canada Regulates transportation on water.\nNatural Resources Canada  \nConducts research on groundwater and hydrologic impacts of climate change.\nOver the years, the federal government has also had roles in funding infrastructure, including \n\nwas completed, these functions were implemented through the Building Canada Fund, \nadministered by Infrastructure Canada.\n4.3 FIRST NATIONS GOVERNMENTAt present, the roles of First Nations in water planning, management and governance relate \nto legally assigned responsibilities in the administration of federal water policies, and the \nmanagement of provincially or federally assigned roles. While Aboriginal rights to water \nhave not been eliminated, and governance (i.e. jurisdiction) of water resources is a goal \nfor many BC First Nations, few if any existing forums formalize Aboriginal rights to, and governance of, water. \nFirst Nations hold more than 700 active provincial water licences for a wide range of \npurposes associated with Indian Reserves. These licences are held either by a First Nation \nor jointly by the First Nation and Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada.\nLegally, the protection and provision of water to First Nations is a responsibility of the federal \n\nBand Councils, AANDC and Health Canada share responsibilities for providing water services \nto Aboriginal communities. Band Councils are responsible for ensuring that drinking water \nsystems are run in accordance with the Protocol for Safe Drinking Water in First Nations \nCommunities (developed by AANDC), and for implementing drinking water monitoring \n\nCanada works with communities to ensure water quality monitoring programs are in place, \ntrains the monitors, and provides community-based education on water issues.\n3 However, \nconcerns about the extent to which the federal government has met these responsibilities \nare well documented. Many First Nations have \nbeen left with limited capacity to manage water \nresources, and as a result, their populations are \ndisproportionately vulnerable to water-borne \ndiseases, drinking water advisories and health \neffects associated with poor water quality. \n4  Legally, the provincial government is obligated \nto consult with First Nations on water use decisions that might affect them.

In BC, local government includes municipalities, regional \ndistricts, and improvement districts. In order \nfor local governments to have jurisdiction over \nfrom the Province under the Community Charter \nand the Local Government Act. It is important to \nnote that municipalities and regional districts have \nsomewhat different jurisdictions and procedures. \nFor example, for some water-related functions \n\nfunction and service delivery area following a \n\nIn BC, local governments are gaining more \ndiscretionary powers over local matters, as \ndemonstrated by changes to the Community \nCharter.\n6 The following are some of the key local \ngovernment roles and responsibilities in water \nmanagement and planning:  Development and management of municipal water \nsupplies, including treatment and distribution \nsystems. This includes provision of safe drinking \nwater in accordance with the public health act;\n  Development and management of municipal \ndrainage and wastewater treatment systems;\n \n\n\n Delivery of local water conservation programs;\n  \nResponsibility for local land use planning and \ndevelopment on private lands, including the \nprotection and management of riparian areas, \nwetlands and other sensitive habitats;  \nResponsibility for the operation and maintenance \nareas; and,\n Water and watershed planning.\n17', 'Local governments have contributed to water \nmanagement planning across the province by \ninitiating, managing and participating in various \nactivities related to water management and \nplanning, including:  \nDeveloping water conservation plans \n and drought management plans;\n  \nParticipating in or leading multi-sector \n water planning initiatives; \n\n plans and strategies;  \nDeveloping liquid waste management plans \n and integrated stormwater management plans; \n  \nDeveloping integrated watershed \n management plans; and \n\n regional growth strategies.\n 7  Local governments also promote community and \neconomic development, which has the potential to \nimpact water resources. \n8  In addition to the planning processes listed \nabove (and those discussed in Sections 5 through 7 of the guide), local governments across \nBC are drawing on other innovative tools and \napproaches to help protect watersheds and plan \nfor water resources. \n4.5 OTHER ORGANIZATIONSMany other organizations have important roles \nto play when it comes to water. The following are \nsome of these organizations and their roles and \nresponsibilities in water management and planning:\nIndustry  \nRelies on water as a vital component of \nproduction; and,\n  \nDevelops plans, policies, procedures and \n\nwastewater for individual business operations.BC Hydro  \nIs licensed to use the largest amount of surface \nwater in the province, with operations that depend \non reliable, carefully managed water supplies;\n  \nWorks to reduce the need to expand hydropower \noperations by encouraging consumer energy \nconservation; and,  Develops water use plans, which modify \nhydropower dam operations to mitigate their impact \n\nAcademic Institutions  \nConduct critical research on topics such as water quality and \nquantity, impacts of climate change, watershed functioning, \ngroundwater and aquifer function, governance policy, demand \nmanagement; and,  \nProvide education and training to future water managers.\nProfessional Associations  \nProvide policy advice, planning support, technical support, \nknowledge sharing and a wide range of services related \nto water planning, management, and operations (e.g. BC \nWater and Wastewater Association, the BC Ground Water \nAssociation, and the Canadian Water Resources Association, \ngeo scientists, engineers, planners, biologists, geographers \nand many other professionals.\nCommunity Organizations and Individuals  \nProvide vital services through outreach, conservation, \nrestoration of source water, and maintenance or restoration \n of aquatic habitat;  \nAre enabled to take greater responsibility for water stewardship \nthrough new, collective shared stewardship approaches; and,\n  \nWork to advance sustainability across local and regional \n\npublic about water issues.4.6 MOVING FORWAR\nD IN WATER PLANNING, \nMANAGEMENT & GOVERNANCEAs will become evident in later sections of this guide, a wide array of planning processes have been developed to assist \nlocal governments and other organizations in navigating the \nchallenges of water management. In some regions of the \n\ndecision-making regarding watershed health in the face of \neconomic and environmental change. As policy makers analyze \nand adjust management strategies with the current social, \npolitical, economic and environmental context, and as managers \n\nneeds, communities are learning to live water smart. The \noutlook is encouraging. In addition to the emergence of a new Water Act for BC, an overarching provincial policy framework \npresently exists comprised of Living Water Smart and the Green \nCommunities Initiative, two complementary initiatives. Living Water Smart provides the vision of the framework, and the Green \nCommunities Initiative complements the Local Government \nAct tools to enable the vision. As a package, the framework provides guidance for aligning local actions with provincial and \nregional goals to \nﬁdesign with natureﬂ\n, in order to create greener \ncommunities, live water smart and prepare for climate change.

Common \npressures throughout BC include population growth, land use practices, \ncommunity and economic development, climate change and other \nchanges in ecosystems (such as the Mountain Pine Beetle infestation). \nTherefore the extent of existing water use requirements and the \nhydrological characteristics of watersheds are important considerations in \nmanaging supply and demand. \nBC communities are adopting a wide range of strategies to manage \nwater. Water planning processes can help communities understand \nchallenges by improving knowledge about water supplies and demands \nincluding sharing the allocation of water across various human activities \n\nmet. For a comparison of three water management techniques (supply \n\nside, demand management, and the ﬁsoft pathﬂ approach) see the 2005 \nPOLIS publication At a Watershed. These approaches can be especially \n\nand drought. The process of water management planning also serves to \nincrease awareness in a community, and stakeholders will be more likely \nto promote responsible water management practices in their homes, \nbusinesses and neighbourhoods.Water supply, demand and allocation management are primarily about \nbalancing water use. These include human water uses for domestic, \nagricultural, hydroelectrical, commercial and industrial consumption, \nas well as natural system water uses to support healthy ecosystems, \n\nhuman use without compromising the environment. Desired outcomes \n\nof water planning may include:  Managing water use and consumption rates to account for seasonal and \nannual changes (e.G.

Water infrastructure is very expensive \nto replace and upgrade, and often water \nconservation is viewed as a preferable alternative \nto increasing capacity. Because of the wider \n\n\nwater infrastructure Œ for water supply and \ndistribution, wastewater treatment, drainage and \n\ntypes of infrastructure for limited capital funds. \n21', 'Climate ConsiderationsClimate change is impacting, and will continue to impact, many aspects of water supply and management in BC. Reduced annual and seasonal precipitation, reduced snowpacks, \nloss of glaciers, changing surface and groundwater hydrology, increased drought and \nincreased demand for irrigation are just a few \nexamples. These and other climate-related \n\nimpacts should be addressed in plans that aim \nto consider medium to long-term pressures \non water supply and demand. The plans should develop solutions for dealing with those pressures. See sections 3 and 9 of this guide \nfor information, tools and resources about \nclimate change impacts on water, related \n\ncommunity vulnerabilities and risks, as well as considerations about how climate impacts can be managed through adaptation and water \nand watershed planning. 5.1 WATER CONSERVA\nTION PLANSWater conservation planning is receiving \nmore and more attention in BC. There is a \ngrowing appreciation of the limited availability \nof water supplies, and an increasing concern \nabout the impacts of climate change on water supply and demand. Water conservation is \none of the best mechanisms to manage water demand within existing supplies, and avoid \nthe cost of developing additional supplies. Rainwater harvesting, leak detection and repairs, and greywater recycling are just a \nfew water conservation strategies that can \nConservation is particularly important in areas \nthat are experiencing population growth, \n\neconomic development and other changes that lead to increased demand for water. \nWater conservation is important in areas where \nthere may be a reduced water supply in the \nfuture as a result of climate change. \nWater conservation plans focus on managing \n\nwater demand, reducing consumption, and \n\nextend beyond household water savings to \ninclude industrial, commercial, institutional and \nagricultural water users. The plans, are relevant \nto both surface and groundwater sources.\nWater conservation plans can help \ncommunities manage the impacts of water shortages that are less severe than drought \nconditions. These plans can also deliver \n\nexperiencing water shortages. Through \nconservation, water suppliers can reduce the \ncosts associated with developing new water supplies, drinking water treatment, drinking \nwater distribution, wastewater treatment and \nassociated pumping and energy costs. Local governments in BC are now required to \nhave water conservation plans to be eligible for \nprovincial capital grant funding for drinking \nwater and wastewater infrastructure.\nWater conservation plans are typically \ndeveloped at the geographic scale of a community or region. It is important \nto consider all water users (residential, \n\nagricultural, industrial), all water supplies (surface and groundwater) and how these \nusers and supplies interact with, and affect, each other. Therefore, the use of \na holistic approach or ﬁwatershed eye-\nviewﬂ to water conservation planning is \nentire watersheds in the decision-making \nprocess, and integrating all aspects of \nwater management into the plan.  Key Elements and StepsThe following are some of the key \n\nelements and steps in preparing a Water \nConservation Plan:  Developing a comprehensive community \n\namounts of water used by different \nsectors (such as household, industrial, \nagricultural, municipal and other use);  Forecasting future water supplies \n and demands;  Developing a future vision of water \n use and supply for the community;  Quantifying and understanding the impacts of different water conservation \n\nmeasures; and,\n  Integrating the water conservation plan with other plans (e.g., Regional growth \n\n\nland use plans, transportation plans, \nintegrated community sustainability \nplans and watershed plans).The POLIS Project on Ecological \nGovernance is a BC-based organization \n\nwater issues and has recently published a \nguide on water conservation planning. \nPOLIS characterizes a strong water \nconservation plan as having: At least a 20Œ50 year time frame;  A comprehensive and thoughtful rationale \n for water conservation;  An integrated approach to water \nconservation, which is linked to other plans such as wastewater, land use, and asset \n\nmanagement plans; and An effective implementation strategy.\nPOLIS characterizes an excellent water \nconservation plan, as one that goes further to: Place ecological health at its core;\n  Be tailored to a community™s watershed \ncontext and consider the community™s impact \non the watershed;  Blend innovative legal tools such as water restrictions and land use planning bylaws \n\nwith practical measures such as rebate and \nmetering programs;\n  Make managing demand a part of daily business rather than a stop-gap measure \ndesigned merely to buy time needed to \nincrease supply;\n  Build in measures that are geared towards \nrainwater capture and wastewater \n\nreclamation, reuse and recycling to better \nmatch water quality to end uses;  Implement outreach and education programs \nthat go beyond information dissemination to engage and inspire citizens to permanently \nchange behaviour; and,   \nUse a ﬁtriple bottom lineﬂ approach to \n valuing water. \n2While it may not be possible or practical in \nall cases for communities to achieve these \ncharacteristics, it is important to consider them during the development and implementation  of water conservation plans to ensure the \nplans are effective, comprehensive and \nsuccessfully implemented.5.2 DROUGHT MANAGEMENT PLANS\nperiod of sustained low precipitation and high \n\n\ngroundwater levels, and water shortages. \n22', '\n\naccumulation, hot and dry weather or a delay in rainfall. Hydrological drought is associated \n\nwith the effect of low precipitation on water levels in rivers, reservoirs, lakes and aquifers. \nHydrological drought affects uses which depend on ground and surface water levels and \n\n  ŒLiving Water Smart\n 3   BC communities have experienced drought in the past and will continue to do so in \n\nthe future. Drought is a projected impact of climate change in BC so communities \n\nmight experience more frequent or severe drought conditions than in the past. Drought \ncircumstances can have profound impacts on the socio-economic and environmental \n\n\nare also affected by drought conditions. When water availability is very low, there can also \nbe concerns about water quality, because pollution levels are relatively concentrated, and \nmore bacteria can survive in warmer water. Lower water availability can also lead to higher \ncosts of water, and restrictions on water use. Water use restrictions can in turn impact \nbusiness operations, employment, personal use and tourism. There is a strong rationale for \n\nundertaking a broad assessment and analysis of overall water allocation in a community or \nregion to help inform the development and implementation of a Drought Management Plan. \nDrought management plans are an important means of minimizing the impacts of water \n\nshortages and drought in a region. Similar to water conservation plans, they focus on \n\n\nconservation plans, effective drought management plans need to consider all water uses \n\n(including household, industrial, commercial, institutional and agricultural). These plans \nplace an emphasis on reducing water demand but are developed to address the extreme \ncircumstances associated with drought. \nDrought management plans are typically developed at the community or regional scale. It is \nimportant to consider all uses of a particular water supply such as a watershed or aquifer, and \nthe interactions between water supplies. A watershed-based approach is particularly relevant \nbecause a drought event typically affects a large area and all types of water supplies.\nA key characteristic of drought management plans is that they identify drought stages \nand trigger appropriate response actions. The Province of BC uses a four level drought \n\n\n\nresponses to these drought stages and triggers (e.g., limiting lawn watering if a reservoir \n\nDrought management plans should be developed before conditions require their use. \nBecause of the potentially severe socio-economic and environmental impacts of droughts, \nemotions can run very high during these events. Therefore, planning well in advance of a \ndrought will allow more time for thoughtful, rational and comprehensive planning than when \na community is already experiencing a drought situation. A proactive approach also enables \n\nfarmers, ranchers, other businesses, institutions and households to assess the plans in advance of a drought and offer feedback. These groups of stakeholders can also take \nmeasures to prepare for the challenges and opportunities associated with implementing \n\ndrought management and water conservation measures.\nKey Elements and StepsThe Dealing With Drought Handbook Œ \npublished by the BC Ministry of Environment in \n2004 and available online Œ provides a common \ntemplate for developing Drought Management \nPlans. The following are some of the key \nelements and steps in preparing such a plan:\n Establish a local drought management team;\n  Document the membership and  operating procedures of the local drought \n\nmanagement team. \n  Evaluate the potential impacts of drought \n on the region™s economy;\n  Evaluate the potential impacts of drought \n on the social & environmental well-being \n of the region;\n  Identify data requirements, frequency of data \ncollection and reporting protocols on local \n\nwater supplies and climate; \nand corresponding local responses; and\n Prepare communications plans. \nThe province of BC has established a Drought \nManagement Framework Œ refer to Drought \nInformation, for information on:  Drought Advisories;\n  Levels of Water Shortages and \n Drought Conditions;\n The Provincial Drought Response;\n Individual Drought Response Measures;\n Resources; and\n  Snow Surveys and Additional Important Info.5.3 WATER USE PLANSWhen it comes to water planning and \nmanagement, a wide variety of human uses \nand instream environmental needs must be \nconsidered and balanced. Water use planning \nis one approach to achieving this balance \n\nor water facility such as a reservoir. To date, \nWater Use Plans (WUP) have for the most part \n\nbeen associated with waterpower licences \nthat are held by BC Hydro. The Comptroller of \nWater Rights or other appropriate authorities \nunder the Water Act may require that a WUP \nbe prepared for any existing licence. Expected \npriorities for the completion of plans are power \ndevelopments, municipal water systems, and \n\nlarger-scale industrial operations. WUPs may \nalso be required for other water control facilities \n\naquatic habitat, or other important values. While \nWUPs for existing licences may be required as \n\n\nas a condition of proponents seeking new \nlicences for larger-scale operations (industrial, \nagricultural, municipal, or other facilities), or \nfor works located on particularly valuable or \nsensitive streams.\n23', '\n\n\n\nﬁa better balance between competing uses of water, such as domestic water supply, \n\nwhich are environmentally, socially and economically acceptable \nto British Columbiansﬂ.

This Water Use Plan is about how the reservoirs and \ndams are operated, how water is released from the reservoirs and how \n\n\npower generation)... The planning process will explore whether and how \nhydropower generation from existing reservoirs can be accommodated \nwithin Metro Vancouver™s commitment to: continue to supply clean, \n\nclimate change. Other community interests such as recreation, culture \nand heritage, and safety, will be reviewed within the context of the \n\nplanning process.ﬁ\n (Metro Vancouver Water Use Plan).\nTo date, all Water Use Plans have been prepared for surface water \nresources. This type of planning process is unlikely to be applicable \nto groundwater resources within current contexts. Although the Water \nAct vests ownership of both surface and groundwater to the province \nof British Columbia, the Act does not require a licence to withdraw \n\nand use subsurface water. However, groundwater regulation is within \nthe scope of the Water Act Modernization initiative. Assessing the role \n\nsurface water values is extremely complicated. Therefore, Water Use \nPlans may be an inappropriate or impractical approach to planning \nfor groundwater resources at this time. However, some of the other \n\n\nadapted to plan for and manage groundwater resources. Facilitating \ncollaborative, multi-sector planning to achieve a balance across multiple \nwater users and management goals is a key attribute of Water Use \nPlans that could be adapted to groundwater strategies. \nAs of 2010, 24 Water Use Plans had been completed for BC Hydro \nfacilities. For more information on these plans see: Water Use Planning \n\nor BC Hydro Water Use Planning \nwww.bchydro.com/planning_\nregulatory/water_use_planning.html?WT.mc_id=rd_wup.\n Key Elements and StepsThe following are some of the key elements and steps in \n preparing a Water Use Plan:\n  Develop the plan in accordance with the provincial water \n use plan guidelines;  \n  \nDevelop the plan through an inclusive, consultative, multi-stakeholder \nplanning process associated with a water act licence, and include \n\n\n\nindustrial users, water licence holders and other interest groups;\n  Undertake hydrological studies, modeling, and assessments \n\n\ncharacterizes water supply and demand within the planning area;\n \nto-day operations of hydroelectric or other water storage facilities;\n  Under the water act the comptroller™s responsibility relates \nto amending waterpower licences and issuing orders to help \nimplement: ﬁoperational changes, monitoring studies and physical works outlined in the planﬂ; and,  Implement the plan in accordance with conditions stated in the \nwater licence renewal or amendment, or through an engineers™ \n\norders under the water act.\n5.4 WATER ALLOCATION PLANSWhen planning for water allocation, a wide variety of human and \nplanning is an approach to achieving this balance in the future for \n\nthe Lemieux Creek Water Availability Report - 2004 is a water \navailability study that is used to some extent as a WAP. It is very \nimportant to undertake this type of planning before a watershed \napproaches its limits of available supply relative to future demands, \n\nand before drought or other extreme conditions threaten good \nrelationships between stakeholders.\n\nas a means to facilitate making water allocation decisions by the Regional Water Manager under the Water Act. WAPs for other \nregions of the province may follow. See Water Allocation Plans.\nThe Ministry of Forests, Lands and Natural Resource Operations \n\n(MFLNRO) may lead or provide assistance to the WAP planning \nprocess. The plan allows for information about the Ministry™s position \non water allocation decisions to be made available to future water \nlicense applicants and the public. By providing greater clarity, \nconsistency and transparency regarding water allocation decisions, \n24', 'Water Allocation Plans can help avoid or reduce potential \n\nWater Allocation Plans are considered regional policy, \nand the MFLNRO uses these plans while exercising its \nauthority (e.g. issuing water licences) under the Water Act. \nThe plans are operational tools developed and used by the \nMinistry to help determine the quantity of water required in \n\na watershed to protect ecosystem health, and the quantity \nof water available to be allocated for human use. \nWhere developed, these plans have improved the \n\nassisted government agencies and water licence \n\napplicants as they ensure that their applications and \nactions align with environmental laws. \nThe Shawnigan-Goldstream Water Allocation Plan \ndescribes these plans as ﬁa means of anticipating and planning for water uses, identifying water demands and ensuring that water use is compatible with the goals of a \nsustainable environment. \nAdvantages of Water Allocation Plans include:\n  The provincial government™s position on water allocation \ndecisions is available to applicants and the public;  Response time for a water license application  is reduced;\n  The need for individual studies and reports on \n each water licence application is eliminated;  Decisions are made more consistently, and \n \n  There is no need for referrals on individual water \n license applications.ﬂ  As of March 2011, 23 WAPs have been completed and \nthree water management plans have been developed \nfor watersheds on Vancouver and the Gulf Islands. \nOne water availability study (to inform water allocation \ndecisions) has also been completed for a water source \nin the Southern Interior. To view a list or to access the plans, visit \n \nwww.env.gov.bc.ca/wsd/water_rights/wap/index.html. \nTo date, all Water Allocation Plans have been prepared for surface \nwater resources. As with water use plans, WAPs are unlikely to be \napplicable to groundwater resources because of the complexity of \ngroundwater resources and because the Water Act does not presently \nrequire a licence to withdraw and use subsurface water. Therefore, \n\nWater Allocation Plans may be an inappropriate or impractical \napproach to planning for groundwater resources. However, some of \n\narea-based planning and consideration of future water demand, can \nbe adapted to plan for and manage the allocation of groundwater \nresources. In addition, groundwater regulation is within the scope of \n the Water Act Modernization initiative.\nKey Elements and StepsThe following are some of the key elements and steps in preparing a \n\nWater Allocation Plan:\n  Planning is initiated by the regional water manager (or equivalent) of \nthe ministry of forests, lands and natural resource operations;\n  The planning process is led by ministry staff when a business case \n\nlicence and allocation decisions;  Assessments are conducted on a watershed basis to identify the \n\n\n\n\ndirection regarding future water licence allocations;\n \ninformation, undertaking assessments, and working with agencies and \nstakeholders to develop the plan;  The WAP\n is submitted to the regional water manager for approval;\n  The WAP\n becomes regional policy upon signature by the regional \nwater manager; and  The WAP\n is reviewed when the regional water manager feels that it is \nappropriate to update or amend the plan.\n1  Brandes, O.M., 2005.

Also under the Drinking Water Protection Act, an \n\norders a water supplier to prepare an assessment where potential threats \n\nsupply. Well Protection Plans, which may also be a requirement under the \nDrinking Water Protection Act, are developed to minimize impacts of land \nuse activities on groundwater supplies that are used by community wells. \nWell Protection Plans can be expanded to the protection of entire aquifers, \nor perhaps multiple aquifers. For this reason, these plans are referred to as \nWell (Aquifer) Protection Plans in this guide. Section 7 of the guide explores \nthe scope and value of water, watershed and storm water management \n\nplans, which are also relevant to the protection of water quality.\nWhy Plan for Protecting Drinking Water Quality?In anticipation of and/or response to mounting challenges, pressures \n\nand changes in their watersheds, it is important for BC communities to plan for protection of their drinking water. Water planning can help BC \ncommunities understand and address current and expected challenges \nby improving knowledge about threats to water quality. Protecting source \nwater and drinking water quality is primarily about ensuring that point and non-point sources of pollution do not adversely impact water for \nhuman consumption. Source water includes surface waters, aquifers, or \n\ngroundwater recharge areas. \nFor an overview of roles and responsibilities for the protection of drinking water \nquality see the Ministry of Health website for Drinking Water Quality.\nConsiderable time, money and effort go into treating water and wastewater \nto protect water quality for various uses. Recently, attention has turned to \n\nthe importance of protecting water sources as a fundamental approach to \nmanaging water quality. Source water protection seeks to identify means of \npreventing, minimizing, or controlling potential sources of water pollution. It is \n\n\nfunctions, and a variety of social, economic, cultural and spiritual values. Figure \n2 illustrates different components of a multi-barrier approach to protecting \n\ndrinking water. For information on the multi-barrier approach see the Interior \nHealth Authority website on Drinking Water Source Protection and Multiple \nBarriers of Drinking Water Health Protection.\n127', 'In many cases other water uses, such as those related to agricultural, commercial, institutional \nand industrial operations, are connected to drinking water supplies. In addition, there are many \necological, recreational and other non-consumptive water uses that must be managed along with \n\nto environmental, cultural, spiritual and aesthetic values.\nDesired outcomes of water quality planning may include:\n  Ensuring a safe, secure supply of quality water for a wide variety of uses;\n  \nEnsuring that water supply is robust and resilient to climate change impacts and other factors;\n  \nManaging wastewater discharges to be within the capacity of receiving waters to absorb \n and assimilate wastes;  Managing land and resource development practices (and day to day human activities) \n in ways that maintain and protect water quality; \n  Practicing urban and rural development in ways that do not adversely affect natural \n \n \nsuch as sediment transport); and  Raising public awareness of the value and importance of fresh water.\nBecause these planning processes consider threats to water quality, they present opportunities \nto consider the impacts of climate change along with other pressures on water quality.\nCommunity Watersheds (CWs) are another potential watershed planning unit for consideration \nin some areas. The province has established 467 CWs in response to the Forest and Range \nPractices Act, (Government Action Regulation) which provides an added level of protection for \nwater quality in association with forestry operations. However, more research may be required to \ndetermine whether there are CWs with completed watershed plans, or there is a desire, capacity \n\nFigure 2.

All BC \nHealth Authorities are required to meet or exceed \nthe Guidelines for Canadian Drinking Water \nQuality. The Vancouver Island Health Authority \ndeveloped its own interpretation of the guidelines \nwith the introduction of the 4-3-2-1 Initiative. This \n\ninitiative is now used by Health Authorities across \nBC to ensure compliance. In some communities, \ncompliance with the guidelines will require the \ninstallation of new treatment plants, which \ncan be a considerable added cost. Because the pressures on water quality are so diverse, \nultimately it is everyone™s responsibility to take \n\ncare of our water resources, including protection \nof water quality at the source.\nBoil Water Advisories\nBoil water advisories are issued to residents \nand other water users when a drinking water \nsource is contaminated or there is a known \nrisk of contamination. Advisories consider the \nwater source, water quality, and distribution \n\n\nquality of drinking water sources in the area and \n\nthe adequacy of treatment systems to provide \nclean water. Over the past decade, the number \nof boil water advisories in BC has increased. This \nmay be due to several reasons related to actual \ndeterioration of water quality, or greater focus on \nmonitoring and attention to risk. In 2008, the BC \nMinistry of Health documented 530 boil water \n\nadvisories. Most of those advisories were on \nsmaller water systems that were serving between \n15 and 5000 people. 2 Land Use and Non-Point  Sources of Pollution \nUrban, industrial and agricultural activities can pose \nserious threats to water quality. These land uses \nare associated with a variety of pollutants including \nnitrates from manure and synthetic fertilizers \napplied to agricultural lands, sedimentation from \neroding soils and stream banks through urban \ndevelopment, and toxic chemicals from a variety \nof industrial, commercial and household sources. \n\nDevelopment activities near shallow wells or above \n\nan impermeable layer above them to protect the \nwater from surface pollutants), increase the risk of \ncontamination, and are of particular concern. \nVulnerable Aquifers\nPresently, no permits are required to drill a well or \n\nextract well water in BC. This lack of groundwater \nregulation is a key challenge; however, this may \nchange with modernization of the Water Act. Drinking water quality concerns may be elevated \nin communities that rely primarily on groundwater sources. This is because groundwater \n\nwithout anyone knowing about it, and because they require more time for natural recycling \n\nand replacement of water than do surface water sources. Therefore, once water quality is \ndegraded, it takes much longer for contaminants to be diluted or removed. This is a concern \nto communities such as Langley BC, which sources 80% of its drinking water from wells.\nSource Protection and Upstream Activities\nIn many cases, resource-related activities on private and Crown lands, such as forestry, \n\nranching, agriculture and mining, can effect nearby or downstream community water \nsupplies. Often these activities take place ﬁupstreamﬂ of community water supplies, \nand may be outside of the jurisdiction of local or regional governments. Typically, local \ngovernments do not have the authority to regulate or stop these resource practices. There \nis also a limitation of government authority when it comes to agriculture even within local \ngovernment boundaries. For example, farm bylaws require approval by the Province of BC \nbefore coming into effect.\nClimate ConsiderationsClimate change is impacting, and will continue to impact, water quality through a variety of \n\n\n\nand increased erosion, turbidity and sedimentation are just a few examples. These and \nother climate-related impacts should be addressed in plans that consider medium to long-\nterm pressures on water quality. The plans should develop solutions for dealing with those \npressures. See sections 3 and 9 of this guide for information, tools and resources about \nclimate change impacts on water, related community vulnerabilities and risks, as well as \n\nconsiderations about how climate impacts can be managed through water and watershed \nplanning as well as adaptation. 6.1 WELL (AQUIFER) PROTECTION PLANSWell Protection Plans can be developed to provide protective measures for minimizing and \npreventing undesirable impacts from land use activities on subsurface community water \nsources. Many wells that provide water to communities or municipalities are located in areas \nwhere human activities can affect water quality. The impact is most severe where these \nﬁcommunity wellsﬂ draw water from shallow aquifers that are vulnerable to contamination \nfrom land use activities and non-point sources of pollution. Protecting source water through \na well protection plan is one of the steps in the multi-barrier approach to drinking water \nprotection. Approximately 40 Well Protection Plans have been established in BC. The \n\nMinistry of Environment is the lead agency for the Well Protection Toolkit.\nWell or aquifer protection plans focus on protecting groundwater quality from potential \n\npollution sources. These sources of pollution may come from the land above or near to the \n\nplans examine water quality threats from a variety of sources, including residential, industrial, \ncommercial, institutional and agricultural land uses as well as natural resource development. \n\na plan that is focused on an individual well without looking at the broader connections of \nmultiple wells and pollution sources across an entire aquifer.\nIn BC, Well Protection Plans may be required under the following circumstances:\n  By health authorities when they review an operating permit for a large drinking \n water system that includes wells;  \nBy the provincial government as a condition of granting infrastructure funding for \n new municipal/regional district wells; and,\n  \nAs a condition of a provincial environmental assessment for proposed large withdrawals.\n3 Well protection plans are developed for an area that includes the recharge area for a well or \naquifer. It is important to consider all land uses and associated threats to groundwater quality. \nTherefore, the use of a holistic approach to planning is encouraged. A more holistic approach \nmay aim to address multiple aquifers within a region or community and it may also aim to \naddress both quality and quantity issues.

Water providers often do not \nhave any control over land uses in the watersheds from which they get their drinking \nwater. They may not be aware of natural conditions or human activities within a \nwatershed that affect surface and subsurface water quality. Proper assessments can \nhelp identify opportunities for preventative or remedial action, and give both the water \n\n\npriority in the region. \n\nmay order a water supplier to complete a water source and system assessment.        \nThe purpose of the assessment is to:  Assess the drinking water source in relation to land uses within the \n watershed and activities that may affect the source;\n  Inventory the water supply system, including treatment options and \n operational procedures;\n  Assess the monitoring requirements for the drinking water source and \n water supply system; and;  Identify current and potential future threats to drinking water. \nThe Ministry of Health has produced both the Source to Tap Screening Tool, which \ncan be used to used as a secondary method for assessing risk in drinking water systems, and the Comprehensive Drinking Water Source-to-Tap Assessment \n\nGuideline, which serves as a tool to help water system managers develop a better understanding of the risks to drinking water safety and availability. The guideline \nprovides a structured and consistent approach to evaluating and managing risks to \ndrinking water. The outcomes of a Source Water Assessment determine whether or \nnot an Assessment Response Plan is required. \n6After reviewing a completed source and system assessment, a drinking water protection \n\n\nunder Section 22 of the Drinking Water Protection Act.

The plans are \n\ndrinking water supply, such as a watercourse, \nwatershed, reservoir or aquifer. Therefore, they \nare relevant to area-based planning for both \nsurface water (watersheds) and groundwater \n\n(aquifers), where the threats to water quality and \nquantity are dispersed across a wide landscape. \nWithin these plans, it is important to consider all \npotential threats to the water source; therefore, a \nwatershed-based approach Œ at the appropriate \nscale Œ is particularly relevant. \nAs of 2011, no DWPPs had been completed \nor designated in BC. They are considered \nto be a last resort because of the stringent \nrequirements associated with them, and should \nonly be considered where it can be established \nthat regulatory tools are required to achieve \nthe planning objectives. DWPPs should only \n\nbe required when other plans fail to address or \nprevent a threat to drinking water. However, there \nare circumstances where threats to drinking water \ncould lead to negative consequences (such as a \nhealth hazard) where no other measures under the \n\nDrinking Water Protection Act would prevent the \nhealth hazard from occurring.\nDWPPs are authorized under Part 5 of the \nDrinking Water Protection Act and are intended \nto address concerns about water quantity and \nwater quality.

Integrating Water, \n Land & Watersheds\nThere are many diverse pressures and challenges on water resources and watersheds in BC.\n\nand explore the value of adopting an integrated approach to planning and \n\nof issues that were raised in sections 5 (water supply and demand) and \n\nplanning considers issues related to watershed functions, ecosystem \nhealth, connections between land use and water, as well as water quality \n\n\npopulation growth, community and economic development, and a wide \n\n\nincreasingly important to consider the impacts of climate change when \ndeveloping planning processes, implementing those plans and making \nAs noted in section 6, healthy watersheds, riparian areas, wetlands, \n\n\n\n\n\nwatershed is compromised by human activities, integrated approaches to \n\n\ninterconnections between water quantity and quality are widely distributed \n\n\n\ncomplex water and land use issues is pointing to the need for an integrated \n\n\nwater quantity, water quality and other watershed issues, as well as the \n\n Water Management Plans (Water Act, Part 4)\n Watershed Management Plans\n Stormwater (Rainwater) Management PlansTypes of Integrated Water & Watershed Planning\n\n\napproaches and can help to address a variety of water supply, demand, \nand quality issues, and include: \n32', 'Why Undertake Integrated Planning  for Water, Land and WatershedsBC communities are undertaking integrated \nwatershed planning and are adopting a wide \nrange of strategies to manage a multitude of current and future challenges, pressures and \nchanges in watersheds. Many of these pressures \nmay be effectively addressed within plans that \nrecognize the interconnections within a watershed \nsystem, including: surface water and groundwater connections;\n water quantity and quality connections; land and water connections; and community and watershed connections.Watershed planning can help BC communities \n\nunderstand and address these challenges by \nimproving knowledge about the current and future \nthreats to water quantity and quality for human \nand environmental uses, and threats to overall \nwatershed health and community sustainability.\nThe desired outcomes of integrated planning for \nwater, land and watersheds may include:\n  Managing water uses and rates of consumption within available water supplies seasonally, \nannually and over the long term;  Developing and managing water supplies in ways \nthat do not compromise the health and biodiversity \n  Managing the allocation of water in ways that support a variety of high-value water uses, including human consumptive and non-consumptive uses as well as instream \nenvironmental uses;\n  Ensuring a safe, secure supply of water for a \nwide variety of uses;  Managing wastewater discharges within the capacity of receiving waters to absorb and \nassimilate those wastes;  Managing land development and resource \nmanagement practices (and day to day human activities) in ways that do not adversely impact water quality;  Managing human development patterns in \nways that stabilize rather than destabilize the hydrologic cycle;\n  Managing human development patterns in ways \nthat reduce rather than increase the vulnerability \nof communities to water-related hazards, such \n\n  Maintaining and strengthening community \nresiliency by preparing for climate change and its \nimpacts on water and aquatic ecosystems.Challenges and PressuresIntegrated water and watershed planning is \nimportant in communities, particularly where \nthere are multiple threats to, or pressures \non, the quantity and/or quality of community water supplies, where infrastructure capacity \nis limited in relation to those threats, and where the health of \naquatic ecosystems is threatened by multiple pressures on water \nquality or quantity. Depending on the community or region of the \nprovince, and on land and resource uses, climate change impacts \n\nfollowing are a few examples of the challenges experienced in \ncommunities across BC where integrated approaches to planning \n\n\nGrowing Demands on Limited Water Supplies\nA variety of land and water uses can impact water supply and \n\ndemand, stream hydrology, groundwater tables, surface and \ngroundwater quality, and the overall health of watersheds. For \nexample, in the Township of Langley, multiple community wells \n\nand private wells withdraw water from the same aquifer. Managing \ndemand within the available supply requires an integrated approach \nto understand the complexity of the challenges associated with water \n\nuse and groundwater recharge, particularly in relation to population \n\ngrowth, economic development and climate change impacts.\nChanges in Land Use and Land CoverIn many communities across BC, changes in land cover due to \n\nactivities such as forestry, and increased imperviousness as a result \n\nhydrology and increased rates of erosion and sediment transport. \n\nFor example, in watersheds with reduced forest cover or increased \nimpervious surfaces, a greater proportion of rainfall quickly enters \nstorm sewers, drainage ditches and streams, resulting in high \n\n\n\nof BC, the mountain pine beetle (MPB) outbreak has resulted in \n\n\n\nand sedimentation, aquatic habitat, and overall watershed health. Many see the MPB outbreak as being caused or exacerbated \nby climate change because average winter temperatures have \n\nwarmed. Historically, cold winters have kept mountain pine beetle \n\noutbreak. Over the long term, forest cover may return to more \n\nnatural conditions and watershed health may recover; however, \nin the interim, communities may need to manage the impacts associated with these pressures. In the case of urban development, \n\nhuman intervention may be required to restore watershed health. \n\nWith respect to the effects of BC™s MPB infestation on hydrology \nnote the 2008 Ministry of Environment report: Mountain Pine Beetle \nInfestation: Hydrological Impacts.\nClimate Considerations Climate change is impacting, and will continue to impact, many aspects of water, land and watersheds in BC. Some of the most \n\ninclude reduced annual and/or seasonal precipitation, reduced \nsnowpack, loss of glaciers, changing surface and groundwater \n\nhydrology, increased frequency and severity of drought and \n\nreduced dilution / assimilative capacity of receiving waters, and \n\nincreased erosion, turbidity and sedimentation. These and other \nclimate-related impacts should be addressed in plans that aim to \nconsider medium to long-term pressures on water quantity, quality, \n\nand ecosystem health. The plans should develop solutions for dealing with those pressures. See sections 3 and 9 of this guide \nfor information, tools and resources about climate change impacts \n\non water, related community vulnerabilities and risks, as well as \n33', 'considerations about how climate impacts can \nbe managed through adaptation and water and \nwatershed planning.The need for a watershed approach is made \neven more evident when compounded by current \nand expected impacts of climate change. For \nexample, the Okanagan, Thompson and Cariboo-Chilcotin regions can expect hotter, drier summers; \n\nextended growing seasons with the potential for \nnew crop production; and increased demand for \nirrigation and livestock watering. Because this will \n\n\n\n\nin this section (water management, watershed management and stormwater management) may consider existing and future watershed processes \n\nand functions, they provide opportunities to \nconsider climate change and its impacts, as well as other pressures, on watershed health. It should \n\nbe noted that although this guide focuses on planning and climate change adaptation for water and watersheds, climate change impacts will \nundoubtedly have a variety of other impacts on terrestrial ecosystems such as forests, grasslands \nand alpine ecosystems. These impacts on the \nwatersheds. However, these land-based climate \n\nimpacts are beyond the scope of this guide.\n7.1 WATER MANAGEMENT PLANS \n(WATER ACT Œ PART 4)Water Management Plans, which were \n\nintroduced under Part 4 of the Water Act in \n2004, involve a comprehensive and integrated \napproach to water and watershed planning. \n\nThis planning process is enabled only if the \nMinister of Environment determines that such \n\n\n\nneeds, or risks to water quality. \nAlthough the Township of Langley has completed \nthe draft of a WMP, to date there are no approved \n\nWMPs in effect in British Columbia. Therefore, \nthe operational compatibility of this planning tool \nwith other Acts and regulations cannot be fully \n\ndetermined, nor can its effectiveness in improving \nwater quality. However, it has been suggested \nthat Water Management Plans hold potential \nas a mechanism for protecting groundwater, as \nwell as for establishing authority for source water \nprotection. Unlike other water planning tools, when \nWater Management Plans are implemented, they \ncan place restrictions on the drilling or alteration \nof groundwater wells and the installation of well \npumps. The plans may also affect other statutory \ndecisions. However, there may be exceptions \n\nwhere the application of a WMP could be limited \nsuch as the Forest Act, Range Act, Forest \nPractices Code of BC Act, and the Forest and \nRange Practices Act. 1, 2 \n  Water Management Plans may provide a good \nstructure for developing valley-wide response plans \nfor severe water shortages because they provide more authority to bring water licence holders \nto the table and hold them to the agreements that have been developed. The plans may also \nbe useful for providing water managers with tools to reduce activities and development in \nwatersheds, thereby addressing the common challenge of managing water resources on private \nas well as Crown lands. In 2009, the Township of Langley submitted a Water Management \nPlan: Final Report to the Minister of Environment for review. As of 2011, TOL is the only local \ngovernment that has been designated by the Minister of Environment to do so. \n2Water Management Plans are applicable to both water quantity and quality issues. In this \nregard, they are relevant for source water protection and for managing demand in relation to \nwater supply. They may also be relevant to both surface water and groundwater sources. \nWater Management Plans are also relevant for area-based planning. They apply to a \ndesignated water management plan area where the water interests are dispersed across \na wide landscape and where many water licensees, groundwater users and land-based \nactivities may be included in the plan. A Water Management Plan could apply to a watershed, \n\naquifer, or another regional scale that is relevant to managing the water resources of a \nparticular community.\nWater Management Plans should be considered where regulatory tools are required and will \nprovide an opportunity to achieve the planning objectives. Upon completion and approval by \n\nresources may be required to develop and implement this type of plan. Therefore, this \n\napproach to planning may not be feasible for some communities.\nWater Management Plans are similar in scope to Drinking Water Protection Plans, which are \nestablished under Part 5 of the Drinking Water Protection Act (see Section 6 in this guide). \nBecause there is potential for the two types of plans to overlap, the Drinking Water Protection \nAct and Water Act state that if both types are to be initiated within one particular area, they \ncan be developed jointly.\nKey Elements and StepsThe following are some of the key elements and steps in preparing a Water Management Plan:\n  The plans are requested by letter to the regional water manager or to the \n comptroller of water rights;\n \n and the province;\n  \nThe plans are initiated & have their terms of reference established by an order of the minister;\n  \nThe plans are required to consider existing provincial or local government strategic, \noperational, and land use or water use planning processes;\n Preparation of the plans must include an extensive public consultation process;\n  Consideration must be given to the results or progress of provincial or local government \nstrategic, operational and land use or water use planning processes within the \ndesignated area;\n \n  The plans are brought into effect by the creation of a regulation that is designed to implement \nthe plan, approved by the provincial government by the lieutenant governor with advice from \n\ncabinet; and,  The plans are implemented through regulation (the plan implementation regulation) \n issued by the lieutenant governor in council.\n7.2 WATERSHED MANAGEMENT PLANS\n\ninvolvement and management actions that are supported by sound science and technology. \nThe watershed planning process works within this framework by drawing on a series of \ncollaborative, iterative steps to characterize existing conditions, identify and prioritize problems, \n\nand adapt selected actions when necessary. The outcome of this process is a watershed plan, \nwhich is a strategy that assesses the state of a watershed and presents detailed management \n\ninformation in terms of analyses, actions, participants and resources required for developing \n\naddresses problems within a watershed in a holistic manner and actively involves stakeholders in \nidentifying management strategies.34', 'BC has no formal requirements or stipulations \nfor undertaking watershed planning processes \nbeyond the provisions under the Water Act \nto develop a WMP, with approval from the \nprovincial government. There is no standard \ntemplate to follow. Nonetheless, many \ncommunities across the province have \ntaken the initiative to complete watershed \n\nmanagement plans by developing their own \napproach to address key concerns in their \nrespective watersheds.\nEvery watershed is unique in terms of its \nfeatures, and every watershed planning \nprocess is unique in terms of the issues being \naddressed and the people involved. Across \nthe province, watershed management plans \ntake different names and different forms, \nincluding watershed strategies, watershed blueprints, watershed recovery plans and \n\nwater use management plans. Despite these differences, several traits are shared by most \nwatershed planning processes. Typically, \nwatershed planning is: An iterative and adaptive process;\n A holistic process;\n  Integrated with other planning processes; and\n A collaborative and participatory process. \n4Conversations with local governments and BC \ncommunities suggest that many critical factors work together to enable a watershed-based approach to planning. These include:\n  A burning issue within the watershed that \ndemands attention (e.G., Water health issue, \n\n  An awareness and recognition of the \n importance of watersheds  An understanding of a variety of planning issues;  \nA political will that aligns with staff capacity \n and commitment;  A willingness to work with neighbouring municipalities in shared watersheds\n \n(where appropriate);\n  A designated body to coordinate the \n effort (e.G., Regional district, okanagan \n basin water board), with funding from \nparticipating municipalities;  A strong stewardship ethic within the \ncommunity; and  A watershed that is at a scale that is  practical and reasonable to work with.\nKey Elements and StepsThere is no absolute template to follow for \nwatershed planning. Every planning process \nand every plan is different. However, many \nelements are critical to the success of \nwatershed plans. Recommended guidelines for watershed planning processes include \n the following:    Develop a clear vision, goals, objectives  and action items;  Seek political endorsement. The relevant \ndecision makers must be willing to consider implementing the plan;  Ensure full representation of all affected \nparties, while keeping the size of the  \nprocess workable;\n  Ensure that the planning process is \nunderstood, used and broadly supported;\n  Provide access to appropriate technical and \nanalytical skills and information resources;\n Obtain sustainable funding;  Ensure planning is done before further \ndevelopment activities (e.g. urban \ndevelopment) will undermine the \neffectiveness of the plan;\n \nand recharge of climate change and activities \n\nand physical works that intercept water (e.g., \n\nfarm dams and forestry);\n  Include inputs from socio-economic analyses \nand incorporate consultation to improve the \nquality of decisions and build community \n Ensure that the values and interests of \nindigenous peoples are considered;\nFigure 3.

All communities in BC are subject \nto rainfall events and need to provide adequate \n\nrecognized that urban development can increase \nimpervious surfaces, impacting the hydrology of \nlocal streams. Rural resource activities such as \n\n\nimpact, hydrology.\nProjections of increased stormwater runoff as a \nresult of climate change and urban development \nhave led some municipalities to seek additional \nfunds for infrastructure upgrades, while other \n\ncommunities are examining alternative approaches \nto managing rainwater. In addition to, or instead \nof, building bigger pipes, ditches and pumps \nto convey water from bigger storms, some \ncommunities are taking the approach of ﬁstore it, \nspread it, and sink itﬂ. Rainwater and stormwater \ncan be viewed as a valuable resource that can \n\nbe stored in wetlands and detention ponds and \n\nThis can reduce or avoid many of the economic \nand environmental costs associated with the \ntraditional model of conveying rainwater as quickly \n\nas possible from roads, rooftops and parking lots \ninto storm sewers, drainage ditches and streams. \nUrban stormwater runoff can adversely impact \n\nhealth by eroding stream banks, by causing water \nturbidity and siltation of spawning and rearing \nhabitat, and by introducing other pollutants, such \n\nas oil from roads, into the system.\nUnder the Local Government Act, municipalities \nare responsible for the provision of drainage, \nand in some cases, Regional Districts may \nalso have associated responsibilities. How we \nhandle stormwater has a huge impact on aquatic \n\necosystems. Integrated stormwater management \nplanning is a proactive process that utilizes land \nuse planning tools to protect property and aquatic \n\ntime accommodating urban growth. Ideally, the aim \nof these plans is to ensure that stormwater runoff \nresembles natural runoff patterns (i.e., volume \n\nand timing of surface water runoff), and does not \ntransport pollutants or sediment from the land into \nwatercourses. Stormwater management plans are \ntypically completed at the local government level, \nwith guidance from the Province.\n 5BC™s Stormwater Planning Guidebook, \n \nreleased in 2002, is premised on the idea that \nland development and watershed protection \n can be compatible. It assumes that municipalities exert control over runoff volume through their \n land development and infrastructure policies, \npractices and actions. Integrated Stormwater Management Plans (ISMPs) are required to be developed and \nimplemented by Metro Vancouver™s member \nmunicipalities in accordance with the Integrated \nLiquid Waste and Resource Management Plan. To help facilitate \nthis, Metro Vancouver developed a comprehensive ISMP \n\nTemplate (consistent with the provincial guide) to guide member \nmunicipalities with this process. The updated LWMP is pending \napproval from the Minister of Environment.\nOutdated approaches to stormwater management, which fail to \nrespect natural systems and water cycles, have been accused \nof being one of the largest water pollution challenges in the \nprovince. In recent years, rainwater management has emerged \nas a new way of thinking about the precipitation that falls on the \n\nthat is best solved by piping water away from properties into \nstreams, rainwater management considers the dynamics of \n\nﬁgreen infrastructureﬂ to maintain natural systems and protect \n\nbuildings. Green infrastructure is a concept that emphasizes \nthe importance of the natural environment in decisions about \nland use planning. For example, the installation of permeable pavements, rain gardens, bioretention ponds and constructed \nwetlands help reduce the volume of runoff that enters sewer \n\nsystems and increase absorption. Instead of relying heavily on \npipes and concrete, green infrastructure takes advantage of the \nthat nature provides. As opposed to the quick, high-impact \n\nmanagement, lower impact green development seeks to mimic \n\nthrough the ground and slowly release into the watershed. \nThe release of Beyond the Guidebook: Context for Rainwater \nManagement and Green Infrastructure in British Columbia \nin 2007 has helped shift the focus of traditional stormwater management to the integrated, holistic approach that rainwater \nmanagement embodies. Climate changeŠand in particular the potential for more \nfrequent and more intense extreme precipitation eventsŠis \nan important consideration in this type of planning. Urban in Canada, and is a priority of the insurance industry. For \nmore details refer to Hazard Perceptions: Public Education \n\nCan Help Snap Flooding, from the Institute for Catastrophic \nLoss Reduction. There is limited science on which to base \n\n\nprecipitation based on the best science available. For example, \n\na planning contingency of a 15% increase in frequency and \n\nduration of winter storms for the next 100 years. These contingencies should inform decisions about which stormwater management techniques to adopt and what the management goals should be in terms of rate of runoff.\nUnder the Environmental Management Act (Municipal Sewer \nRegulation), stormwater management planning is a formal \nrequirement of Liquid Waste Management Plans, which is one of \nseveral mechanisms used by the Province to regulate stormwater \nin BC. Although municipalities are generally not required to have \nLiquid Waste Management Plans, they often opt to complete \nsuch plans because the plans allow a suitable length of time to \ndevelop and implement effective and affordable solutions. \nThe outcome of integrated stormwater planning includes regional \nor watershed level objectives and priorities, integration of these \nobjectives into community planning, and implementation of on-site practices that reduce volume and rate of run-off and improve \n36', '\n Plans and zoning bylaws that regulate the location of development and density of use. \n5 completed plans include: \n \n \n\n  \nProtection of water supply (e.g., groundwater recharge areas); \n  \nManagement of erosion and sedimentation processes; and\n  \nProtection of aesthetic values and recreational uses of water.\nKey Elements and StepsThe Stormwater Planning Guidebook provides a detailed explanation of the various \n stages of preparing a plan. It outlines three key steps and associated methods that \n \n principles to uphold in the process, as outlined below. They include the following:\nStormwater Planning Steps\n1.

Learning From Experience This section provides a synthesis of several relevant \nissues or themes to consider in relation to water and \nwatershed planning.Several common themes emerged from the literature that was \nreviewed during the preparation of this guide, from discussions \nwith project advisors, from interviews with practitioners and \ncommunity representatives and from research about water \n\nexplored in this section and shared to help communities build a \n\n\n\nplanning process and for any individual or organization involved \n \n\n Re-thinking Watersheds and Planning\n Community Collaboration and Engagement Regional Approaches\n \n 38', '8.1 RE-THINKING WATERSHEDS AND PLANNING Œ JOHN MUIR, Naturalist, ConservationistHistorically, the traditional approach to water management has been fragmented, not integrated to \n\nseparately, and decision making around water resources has been governed more by political \nboundaries than by natural ones. More recently, however, watersheds have received renewed attention \nas an important unit for planning, and there is wide acceptance that the management and planning \nof water should occur at a watershed level. For example, at a national level, Canada™s Federal Water \nPolicy adopts watersheds as the preferred spatial unit for water resource planning.  \nAn integrated approach to watershed planning considers the interactions between the biophysical, \nconstructed and human landscapes within a watershed (Figure 4). An integrated approach \nrecognizes the interdependencies in both natural and human systems, as detailed in the table below.   \nIntegration in the Natural System Integration in the Human SystemBetween land and water use\n  \nMainstreaming water in the national economy\nBetween surface water and groundwater\n  \nEnsuring coordination between sectors\nBetween water quantity and quality\n  \nEnsuring partnership between public and private sector management\nBetween upstream and downstream  \nInvolving everybody\nBetween freshwater and coastal waters\n Integrated watershed planning provides a means for coordinating decisions among government and \n\n\nresolution of these issues is typically done through multi-stakeholder collaborative planning; through \nmonitoring, research and consultation; by negotiating consensus; and by ensuring accountability \nthrough open communication, education and public access to information. Integrated watershed \n\n\n\nIntegrated watershed management is also \nreferred to in some regions as ecosystem-based \nmanagement. By this approach, \nﬁinstead of \nmanaging a watershed as an adjunct to the \nwater supply, maintaining healthy watersheds is \nconsidered a prerequisite to water management; \n\nwater allocations are constrained by the larger \nneed to ensure that the natural processes are \nmaintainedﬂ.1 More recently, the terms ﬁwater \ncentric planningﬂ, ﬁdesign with natureﬂ, and the \nﬁsoft pathﬂ approach have been used in BC to \ndiscuss and promote the concepts embedded in \nintegrated watershed management. Water centric \nplanning is described next. See the web version \nof this guide for information on design with nature \nand the soft path approach.\n39Watershed\nIntegrated\n Watershed\n ManagementBuildingsHumansLandscape\nFigure 4 Œ Components of Integrated \n Water and Watershed Management\n', '8.1.2 WATER CENTRIC PLANNINGWater centric planning refers to planning with a view \nto water, on any scale. The underpinning premise \nof water centric planning is that resource use, land \nuse and community design will be done with an eye \ntowards their potential impact on a watershed. This \napproach puts water stewardship and sustainability \nat the centre of land use, development, or resource \nplanning initiatives. Water centric decisions consider \n\nthe amount of water available, the amount of water \n\nquality of water leaving an area, how rain and snow \nwater are managed, and the impact of development \non the natural environment. As such, it requires \nthat missions, mandates and accountabilities of \nparticipating agencies be ultimately integrated. \nWater centric planning is founded upon an earlier \nconcept used in BCŠ the watershed landscape-based approach to planning. Water centric planning \ncan be used at the watershed, sub-watershed, or site \nlevel. Its objectives include:  Protection of people and property from \n natural hazards;\n  \nPreservation and conservation of \n self-sustaining ecosystems;  \nContinuation and growth of resource-based \neconomic activity; and  Provision of an affordable, sustainable \n and maintainable infrastructure.\nMany policies and tools are available to local \ngovernments to implement water centric \n planning, including: \n  Regional conservation strategies that identify land \nand water to be protected;\n \npermit areas around all types of watercourses and \nassociated habitats;  Liquid Waste Management Plans that have an \nincreased emphasis on non-point source pollution \n\nand water;  Zoning bylaws that promote high-density \ndevelopments; Regional Growth Strategies;\n  Regulatory bylaws, such as watercourse protection \nbylaws and subdivision bylaws; Watershed and Well (Aquifer) Protection Plans;\n \n  Infrastructure funding directed to designated growth \nareas; and, \n  Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design \n(LEED) Green Building Rating System. \nThe water centric approach also builds on lessons \nlearned from past and recent practices related \nto integrative planning and implementation \nof planning decisions. It operates within the \n\ncontext of existing regional and municipal \nstrategies, such as Regional Growth Strategies \n\ninter-municipal cooperation where watershed \nboundaries cross local government boundaries.\n 3The South Okanagan Regional District™s Regional Growth Strategy (RGS) was used as a \n\npilot for water centric action in BC. The policy clearly recognizes the relationship between \nland and water, both in terms of water use and water runoff. A toolkit was developed to \naccompany the RGS and to guide decision making on the ground in terms of how land \nwill be developed and water will be used, and to assist with benchmarking, monitoring and measuring key objectives within the policy.   \n8.2 COMMUNITY COLLABORATION AND ENGAGEMENTﬁThe hope for achieving sustainability in water management lies in the establishment of \n\ninterdependent, community-based partnerships and increased stakeholder involvement.ﬂ \n ﬁSimply put, transformational change will result when decision-makers in government \ncollaborate with grass-root visionaries in the community to create a legacyﬂ\n  The value of collaboration among, and engagement with, different orders of government, \ndifferent water use sectors, stewardship organizations, and the multitude of community \n\nstakeholders is a recurring theme throughout this guide. Collaboration is often cited as \na key success factor in watershed planning. Basically everyone has a role to play, and a \n\n\nengagement and collaboration include:  Stronger relationships between participants in terms of trust, respect, information sharing, \nand improved negotiation; \n  More comprehensive and widely accepted land use decisions as a result of improved \ncommunications, demonstrated commitment, and information sharing;  Greater likelihood of successful implementation of the plan as a result of the involvement of \n\n  Greater accountability of all community members involved in the planning process with \nregards to their own actions and behaviours in a watershed. \n\neffective planning and implementation.\nThe sections that follow identify some key aspects of collaboration in water and watershed \nplanning in BC. Recommendations for developing collaborative planning processes with local \ngovernments in BC are provided, the importance of working with First Nations is discussed, \n\nconcerns, challenges and barriers associated with collaborative planning are highlighted, along \nwith some of the opportunities or breakthroughs that BC communities have experienced when \n\nnavigating through these challenges.\nMultiple Planning Partners of Local Governments in BCA growing interest and willingness within BC communities to get involved in watershed \n\n\nbroader regional land use considerations, collaboration is becoming a preferred model of \ndecision making in many parts of the province. At the community level, a greater emphasis on \ncollaborative planning for watersheds has put local governments in touch with a wide range \nof partners from different government organizations as well as representatives from both the \nbusiness and stewardship communities. The following are a few examples of the partners that \nwork with local governments in planning as well as some common roles these partners play. \nThis information is from 21 in-depth interviews with local government staff from across BC. \nSee also Section 4 of this guide for information on roles and responsibilities in water planning, \nmanagement and governance.\n  Federal Departments (Environment; Fisheries and Oceans; Health; Aboriginal Affairs and \nNorthern Development and others)\n Œ Regulatory and/or approval roles; infrastructure funding; \n\nadvisory roles; monitoring and reporting; research and educational roles.\n  Provincial Ministries (Environment; Health; Forests, Lands and Natural Resource Operations \nand others) Œ Regulatory and/or approval roles; water licenses and allocation; infrastructure \n\nfunding and planning grants; advisory roles; monitoring and reporting; research and \n\neducational roles.\n  First Nations, Municipalities and Regional Districts Œ Provision of water services and \nrelated infrastructure and/or service agreements (drinking water, wastewater treatment, \n\nstormwater/drainage); advisory roles; monitoring and reporting; coordination and liaison; \nshared planning and co-management; funding partners; information sharing; and research \nand educational roles.\n40', '  \nAcademic Institutions Œ Research roles including research funding and student support roles.\n  \nIndustry and Businesses Œ Advisory roles; monitoring and reporting; funding partners; research and educational roles.\n  \nCommunity Œ Community members are engaging in various aspects of planning and management such as:\n Attracting landowners to planning tables; Gathering information on watershed history and resource use;\n Identifying community and watershed values and identifying priorities; Collecting input, feedback and advice on key issues and documents; Organizing special events and open houses; Collecting resource data;\n Reporting violations; and, Managing communications and media relations.\nGood Practices for Collaborative Multi-stakeholder ProcessesBringing the right people together to discuss the myriad of issues within a watershed is no easy task, but when done well, it can be an \n\nmulti-stakeholder process; however, a broad set of principles, or good practices, that contribute to successful outcomes of collaborative \n\nengagement for successful watershed planning.Criterion    \nDescriptionPurpose and incentives    \nThe process is driven by a shared purpose and provides incentives to participate and to work towards achieving consensus in the process. \nAll participants should agree on the types of issues to be addressed by the planning process. A clear ﬁterms of referenceﬂ may allow groups \nto decide whether to participate or not. \nStakeholder participation \n     \nAll parties with a signi˜cant interest in the issues and outcome are involved throughout the process. These could include residents, farmers, \nranchers, businesses, industries and others. Representatives should be selected in a fair and open manner by each of the groups that have \nan interest in the outcome. Timelines for the planning process need to accommodate stakeholder participation and engagement.\nVoluntary participation and commitment\n  \nParties, who are affected and/or interested, participate voluntarily and are committed to the process.\nSelf-design    \nThe parties involved work together to design the process to suit the needs of that process and its participants.\nClear ground rules\n    \nAs the process is initiated, a comprehensive procedural framework is established which includes clear terms of reference and operating \n\nprocedures. This part of the process can also help to clarify realities and expectations in terms of roles, responsibilities and limitations.\nEqual opportunity and resources  \nThe process provides an equal and balanced opportunity for effective participation of all parties. \nPrincipled negotiation and respect\n   \nMulti-stakeholder planning proceeds from the assumption that everyone has something to gain by reaching agreement. The process \noperates according to the conditions of principled negotiation, including mutual respect, trust and understanding.\nAccountability\n    \nThe process and its participants are accountable to the broader public, to their constituents, and to the process itself.\nFlexible, adaptive and creative\n  \nFlexibility is designed into the process to allow for adaptation and creativity in problem solving. \nHigh-quality information\n    \nThe process incorporates high-quality information into decision-making. All participants should share information and cooperate to gather \n\nwhat information is needed for effective planning. \nCooperation\n    \nCooperation and working relationships between participating groups is improved both during and after the process is completed. \nTime limits\n    \nRealistic milestones and deadlines are established and managed throughout the process.\nCommitment to implementation and monitoring\n The process and ˜nal agreement include clear commitments to implementation and monitoring.\nEffective process management\n  \nThe process is coordinated and managed effectively. \nIndependent facilitation\n    \nThe process uses an independent trained facilitator throughout. This may not be necessary in all cases, particularly where the planning \n\nissues may be less con˚icted, where the community is not polarized, or where the lead facilitator of the planning process has established \ntrust and credibility within the community. \nAdapted from both WCEL (2010) and Frame et al. (2004)\n41', 'Collaboration with First NationsIntergovernmental relations around water and \nwatershed management are challenging, and \nthe case is no different with First Nations. A \nkey observation that emerged from workshops \nheld with First Nations in the summer of 2010 is \nthat ﬁFirst Nations are often not consulted, not \nconsulted enough, or not consulted soon enoughﬂ. \nIn some cases, this is attributed to existing policies \n\nand structures that limit participation by First \nNations, and there is a sense that addressing \nFirst Nations™ rights can slow down a planning or \ndecision-making process.\n\nthat ﬁalthough First Nations across Canada are \nalready experiencing the impacts of climate \nchange, they are often left out of policy discussions \nthat will affect water health and security in their \nterritoriesﬂ. 8 Although stakeholder engagement \n\n\nNations input some Bands have indicated the need \nfor more direct participation in the modernization of \nBC™s Water Act.\nIn some cases, limited participation by First Nations \nrelates to limited capacity within their communities. \n\nIt can be challenging for smaller First Nation \ncommunities who have limited resources to keep \nup with government invitations to participate in \na multitude of referrals, and other planning and \ndecision-making processes. There is also concern \nthat participating in such processes can sometimes \nbe misinterpreted as\n ﬁrepresenting the First Nation \ncommunityﬂŠa mandate that may not actually be \nafforded to one individual. \n8Working towards more effective collaboration \nwith First Nations requires building government-\nto-government relationships that acknowledge \nAboriginal title and rights. To foster these \nrelationships, it is important to develop a shared \nvision that celebrates differences as well as areas \nof common ground. A shared vision enables the \n\n\nplans, and a commitment to shared decision-\nmaking. Through trial and error, experiences \n\n\nFirst Nations. A series of recommended best \nmanagement practices for building successful and \npositive relationships between First Nations and local \n\ngovernments was developed at a workshop with \nregional districts in 2005. Many of these practices \nalso apply to other relationships within collaborative \ndecision-making processes:\n Establish a relationship before there is a problem;\n  Respect each other™s differences \n (i.e., do not try to change each other);  \nRecognize and understand that history and \n past experiences impact current perceptions \n and opinions;  \nFocus on learning about each other™s history \nand initiate information-sharing events early in \nthe process to learn about the respective roles, \n\nresponsibilities and history of each \n other™s organizations;\n Recognize the importance of a First Nations Chief and Council;  Focus on slow, incremental steps and recognize that success \n cannot be measured in the short term;\n  \nWork towards the project agenda after individual relationships are \n \nunderstanding of each other™s needs and the reason for interaction);\n Focus on areas of common concern or interest;\n  Identify the elements of uncertainty and work towards addressing \n them before they create friction in the relationship;\n Be prepared to resolve disputes and agreements;\n Establish a process and forum for communication and dialogue;\n  \nExchange staff lists to allow for quick and effective contact between \norganizations; and, \n \nLeadership and Local Champions\nleadership. Having a champion behind a planning initiative can really \nhelp motivate a group, and keep it focused on the end goal. This can \nbe particularly important to sustaining interest, support and momentum \nover the long term during the development and implementation of the plan. Planning can take time, patience and persistence, and a committed and passionate champion can help build and maintain the necessary momentum. This is especially important during periods of \nA widely respected and credible leader can also inspire broader \nparticipation and collaboration within a planning process. For example, \nsomeone who has the respect of farmers, business owners and \ncommunity activists can strengthen the credibility of a planning process, \nand thus inspire these and other stakeholders to participate in it. A leader \n\nmay be a mayor, chief, or chair of a regional district or other prominent \nboard. However, local champions can also be highly respected citizens, \nvolunteers, retired professionals, or other community leaders with less \n\nIf there is no apparent single leader within a process, it can be helpful to \nbring in people from around the region and/or country who have relevant \n\nexperience and expertise on key issues. For example, in the early stages \nof developing the planning process for the Coquitlam River Watershed \nStrategy, people from outside the watershed were invited to share their \nsuccesses and failures with their roundtable processes. This helped \nset the bar and create inspiration within the planning group. From this \nfoundation, leadership emerged from different factions of the community, \nincluding government and beyond. \n8.3 REGIONAL APPROACHESBeing proactive by planning for watersheds and climate adaptation can \n\nbe especially challenging for communities that have limited human and \nor a lack of expertise. Changing the ﬁold way of doing businessﬂ does not happen overnight, and achieving water sustainability is less likely to \nhappen if communities work in isolation of each other. \nIn some cases, local leadership can be supplemented and/or strengthened \nwith collaborative approaches at the regional scale. This can be particularly \nappropriate when implementing a watershed-based approach and an \nintegrated approach. For example, Convening for Action on Vancouver \nIsland, the Okanagan Basin Water Board and the Fraser Basin Council \noffer several opportunities to collaborate at regional scales to strengthen \ncommunity resiliency, protect watershed health, prepare for climate change \n\nand advance sustainability. \n42', '8.3.1 CONVENING FOR ACTION ON VANCOUVER ISLANDConvening for Action on Vancouver Island (CAVI) is an exciting initiative that has \nemerged in response to the need to plan for sustainable water resources within the \ncontext of a rapidly growing population. CAVI is not a formal organization; rather, it could \nbe considered as an ﬁad hoc groupﬂ designed to provide leadership, coordination, \n\n\nCAVI™s focus is to build an understanding about how we should be dealing with water \nas it relates to conservation, development and land use. CAVI does not use a particular \nplanning tool or process. Instead, it uses the informal process of collaboration to build \ncapacity and a network of like-minded individuals across Vancouver Island so these \n\nbylaws) to bring about positive change in local watersheds. Education and communication \nare other key tools that CAVI uses. Its aim is to move from talk to action by developing \ntools, providing training and building capacity. \nAt the heart of the initiative is the concept of water centric planning. Through education and \nawareness-building initiatives, including learning lunches, CAVI demonstrates how water centric \n\nﬁAt CAVI, we bring together those who plan and regulate land use (local governments), those \nwho build (developers), and those who provide the legislative framework (the Province). We \n\nprovide the expertise and support to municipalities and organizations with a focus on achieving \nwater sustainability and then help them to share their ideas and successes so that others can \nsee how they too can get on boardﬂ  \nSince its launch in September 2006, CAVI has witnessed considerable success in getting \nits message out, and is seeing mindsets beginning to shift towards water centric thinking, \nplanning and decision-making. Participants in the CAVI process include the BC Water and \n\nWaste Association, Real Estate Foundation of BC, Ministry of Environment, Ministry of \nCommunity and Rural Development (now Community, Sport and Cultural Development), \nmunicipalities and regional districts, POLIS, private consultants, developers, academics, First \nNations and citizens™ groups.\nParticipants attribute some of this success to the fact that ﬁCAVI has no baggage, no \nrequirements, no regulatory authorityŠit simply provides a forum for people to talk about \n\ncommon problems and solutions, and interact through workshops, the Waterbucket website, \nconferences, and seminarsﬂ. The emphasis on collaboration within CAVI, and focus on \nintegration across the Vancouver Island region have also been critical success factors. Finally, \n\n\nseeking funding to support water planning and management. \nﬁOn Vancouver Island, local governments are demonstrating what can be accomplished through \npartnerships and collaboration. Success in moving from awareness to action is ultimately keyed \nto a regional team approach that is founded on the notion of shared responsibilityﬂ \nŒJOHN FINNIE, CAVI Chair\n8.3.2 OKANAGAN BASIN WA\nTER BOARDThe Okanagan Basin is one of BC™s fastest growing regions. With increasing demands for water \nby residents, tourists, and agricultural producers (which accounts for as much as 70% of water \n\nmonths, and groundwater resources are vulnerable to contamination and drawdown.\n In the Okanagan Valley, a regional approach has proven useful for advancing water management \ndecisions. ﬁThe Okanagan Basin Water Board (OBWB) was initiated in 1968 (legislated in 1970) \nas a water governance body tasked with identifying and resolving critical water issues at the \nscale of the Okanagan watershed–The overall objective of the organization is to undertake \nstrategic projects and programs at the Basin scale that meet the collective needs of Okanagan \ncitizens for long-term sustainable water supplies while supporting the capacity of member \njurisdictions to meet their own water management goalsﬂ (www.obwb.ca/about/). \nThe Board is comprised of representatives from each of the three regional districts in the \nbasin: Okanagan-Similkameen, Central Okanagan and North Okanagan. The Board also has \n\nrepresentation from First Nations, the Water Supply Association of BC, and the Okanagan \nWater Stewardship Council, which was formed in 2006. The Board is unique in its powers \nto tax and pass bylaws, and is supported through annual property tax assessments within \nthe basin. The Board does not have regulatory authority but seeks to improve water \nmanagement by providing a basin-wide perspective and improving communications among \nregions to reduce fragmentation in policy and \n\nplanning. The Board also works to improve \nlinks between local and senior governments by \nparticipating as a partner in Okanagan water \nresearch and infrastructure funding.\nWhereas municipalities and regional districts \ncontinue to plan for local water needs, watershed-scale considerations are addressed at the regional \nlevel through the \nleadership of the OBWB. Some key activities of the Board include:\n  Implementing basin-wide programs for millfoil \ncontrol, sewage infrastructure funding, water \n\nscience and management;  Acting as a hub for water information by \nincreasing communication, building partnerships \n\nand reducing duplication;\n  Acting as a voice for okanagan water interests \nby advocating and representing local needs to \n\nsenior governments;\n  Providing science-based information to \ndecision makers;  Expanding local capacity by providing a stable \nsource of funding and in-kind partnerships, \n\nand by being a single organizing body for \n\ncoordinating watershed projects; and\n  Providing a forum for debate about \n watershed priorities.  Through its work, the OBWB has sought to \nintegrate Okanagan water policy and planning on \n\na basin-scale by bridging the interests of multiple \njurisdictions and shifting towards implementing \npolicies and agreements that protect water \n\nsupplies. The Okanagan Sustainable Water \n\nimplementation in the basin in the coming years, \n\nillustrates how a regional approach can be applied \nto water planning and management. Numerous \nrecommendations made in this action plan are\n being implemented incrementally, and successes \nin groundwater monitoring and establishing a \n43', 'water use reporting process have already been \n\nrequire inter-jurisdictional arrangements so that \ncommunities of the basin can prepare for climate \n\nchange and population growth in the watershed. \nThe OBWB is the mechanism for bringing these \ngroups together on a regional basin scale to plan \n\nand manage water resources. \n128.3.3 FRASER BASIN COUNCILIn the Fraser River Basin, the Fraser Basin  \nCouncil (FBC) strengthens regional and \nwatershed-based approaches to address a wide \nvariety of sustainability issues. Formed in 1997, \nwith a primary mandate ﬁto advance sustainability in British Columbia with a core focus on the \nFraser River Basin.ﬂ FBC has a collaborative \ngovernance structure, which is led by 37 directors \nfrom the four orders of governmentŠfederal, \nprovincial, local and First NationsŠand from the \nprivate sector and civil society. \nWell into its second decade of service, the FBC \n\ncommon sense solutions to long-standing \nand emerging sustainability issues, such as community planning, watershed health and climate change adaptation. To achieve its goals, the FBC serves as an impartial, \ntrusted facilitator operating under a unique model \nof collaborative leadership. The FBC was founded \n\non the belief that the major sustainability priorities, \nincluding management of the Fraser Basin, cannot \nbe effectively addressed by any one jurisdiction but \nrather by bringing together the diversity of interests \nand jurisdictions to solve complex problems. \nThe reason so many contentious issues remain \nunresolved is often because leaders in different \n\nsectors are working in isolation of each other. \nThe overall framework for the Fraser Basin Council™s \nwork is the Charter for Sustainability. The charter \nis a good-faith agreement, signed in 1997, by \nrepresentatives from multiple sectors across the \nFraser Basin who believed in collaborative action for \n\na more sustainable future. \n\nof sustainability, described as:\nﬁLiving and managing activities in a way that balances social, economic, environmental and \ninstitutional considerations to meet our needs and those of future generations.ﬂ  \n\nFraser River Basin: Upper Fraser, Cariboo-Chilcotin, Thompson, Fraser Valley and Greater \n Vancouver-Sea to Sky. \nThe following are a few highlights of Fraser Basin Council accomplishments, all of which were \nundertaken with regional and collaborative approaches. The FBC:\n \nsustainability planning and climate change adaptation; \noutreach with a high level of aboriginal engagement and many working partnerships for the \n  Launched and contributed directly to the development of a land use planning process for \nthe shuswap lakes system to encourage development in less sensitive areas of shuswap \n\n\nCurrent priorities and next steps include protecting and restoring foreshore habitat, \nmaintaining and improving water quality, informing and educating the public and industry \ngroups, and initiating coordinated development and recreation plans;\n \ndrinking water protection;\n \nregional reports, on the health of the fraser basin and province of bc to raise awareness and \nencourage action across sectors on economic, social and environmental issues; and,\n \nreceived national recognition.\n8.4 HUMAN AND FINANCIAL RESOURCESﬁWater is a liquid more precious than oilﬂ\n  ŒTONY BLAIR, former British Prime Minister Integrated water and watershed planning requires a dedicated and skilled team of people. \n\ngovernments and others, who often cite inadequate resources and overtaxed staff as primary \nlimitations on being more proactively engaged in certain aspects of watershed protection. Some \nlocal governments also note that watershed planning is a specialized skill that is beyond the \n\n\nfor some communities to effectively manage and/or participate in collaborative processes. \n\nis showing that success in advancing water and watershed planning often comes down to \n\nresources is desirable, it may not be realistic in many communities. Instead, communities are \nrequired to work more creatively with both internal and external resources in order to advance \n\ntheir goals for water and watershed protection. \n44', '8.4.1 STRENGTHEN HUMAN \n RESOURCESHuman resources, both in terms of availability \nand expertise, can be a limitation to water and \nwatershed planning and to climate adaptation. \nBoth areas require a strong team of experts with \nspecialized knowledge, expertise and skill sets. \nContracting out portions of the work to supplement \nor complement staff skills and expertise may be \npossible in some circumstances; however, this \n\noption is not always available to local governments, \nwhich often have limited funds. \nCapacity may be limited in smaller BC \ncommunities, where there may be only one or two \nmunicipal staff to cover planning responsibilities, \nand where funds may be too limited to cover the \n\ncosts of hiring consultants. This may be a particular \nchallenge for proactive initiatives, such as water \nand watershed planning, and for integrating climate \nchange adaptation into such plans. \nFirst Nations also have limited capacity to undertake \nwater planning, management and governance due \n\nto small staff sizes and limited resources for training \ncommunity members in key water planning and \nmanagement skills. Compounding these challenges \nare circumstances where there are many other \npriorities for First Nations that compete for limited \nresources and staff capacity.  \nIn contrast, larger local governments, such as Metro \nVancouver and the Capital Regional District, which \nhave greater staff capacity, are able to attract more \nfunds, and advance planning and management \ninitiatives. These larger communities are also better \nable to interact with other initiatives and institutions, \nwhich can lead to more learning opportunities. \nThe Value of a CoordinatorMany communities have found that having a \n\nproject coordinator is often key to the success \nof water and watershed planning initiatives. \nIn the case of the Bowker Creek Urban \nWatershed Renewal Initiative, having a part-time \nCoordinator, whose salary is cost-shared by all \nthree participating municipalities, has been key \nto securing project funding. This person is able \n\nto dedicate time to writing grant applications, \nand having a Coordinator has given the project \ngreater credibility. A Watershed Coordinator \nhas also helped secure funds for the Theodosia \nStewardship Roundtable and Watershed Recovery \nPlan, and as a result, he is able to focus on both \nland and water management within the watershed. \n8.4.2 STRENGTHEN FINANCIAL \nRESOURCES\nof planning, and is commonly cited as a limiting factor in planning processes. Resources are \nneeded to establish and manage a planning process, and to implement its outcomes (i.e., \nthe plan™s recommendations). Effective strategies \nfor resourcing water and water planning \narrangements include: \n  \nUsing consultants only when necessary (often best for technical work);  \nWriting the plan with in-house staff can save money; and \n  \nHiring a coordinator to oversee the planning process. \nWhether a planning initiative is just beginning, in mid process, or ready for implementation, \n\noutcomes of the process. The funding environment for water and watershed planning in BC is \n\nchallenging and competitive. Funds are limited; therefore, competition for grants is high. Local \n\n\nLocal governments also have limited human resources for developing project proposals and \nwriting and submitting grant applications. \nThe situation is similar for climate adaptation planning processes. While funds may be \n\nsecure funds to implement adaptation measures. Even in communities that have been \n\nsums of money on implementing those plans. For example, making proactive choices \nto upgrade municipal utilities may make sense on one level, but when there may be no \n\nto commit to large investments. \nDevelop a Financial StrategyPlanning processes invariably take longer than expected. Thinking the process through \n\n\nnecessary to know what needs to be accomplished and what the measurable objectives are \nfor the various aspects of the project. For each objective, consider: \n When will the money be needed? \n Where will it come from? \n How will it be directed? \nﬁIf you wait until you have enough money, you™ll never do it.ﬂ\n   Œ  TOM RUTHERFORD, Georgia Basin Living Rivers Program\nWhen developing a funding model or strategy it is important to be creative. There is no single, \n\ncertain way of securing funds for a watershed project. Each community has its own set of \n\nopportunities into consideration. The following are recommendations, gathered from various \ncommunities across the province, for successfully obtaining project funding:\n  Be strategic; look at the bigger picture. Design your project so that it can advance multiple \nobjectives, such as climate change mitigation and/or adaptation and environmental \n\nenhancement. Recently, the integration of climate change adaptation into planning projects \n\nhas become strategic from a funding perspective. Local governments, such as the Capital \nRegional District, intend to draw on this to the best of their abilities by tapping into funds for \npilot initiatives. Another ﬁbig picture approachﬂ is to integrate watershed planning within land \n\nuse decisions. This may open up new opportunities by diversifying funding sources. \n  Align with common objectives. Identifying how various departments and/or external \norganizations can contribute to project objectives is important for moving a project forward, \n\nboth within the planning process and during implementation. The approach adopted within \n\nthe Whistler 2020 Plan was intended to allow the community to use community resources \n\nin a more strategic and coordinated way. The community of Whistler invested time in \n\nidentifying common goals and a shared vision across organizations within the community. \nRather than requiring new resources, the Whistler2020 approach is based on the alignment \nof existing budgets and resources to ensure that all relevant organizations and individuals \n\n\n\npurposes. This approach seeks to make the best use of existing resources. \n  Be realistic about project timelines and budgets. The Bowker Creek Initiative adopted \na 100-year timeline because the work that needs to be done in the watershed is too \ncostly to be funded all at once. Rather than getting bogged down in the high costs of \n\n\nof the creek and on achieving incremental progress. Municipalities can agree in principle \n\nabout the scope and direction of the plan without being held responsible for spending \n\n\n\n\ncommitted to moving the plan forward by working on key short-term actions now that \nwould set them up for bigger things in the future. \n45', '  \nLeverage funds. Grant leveraging entails using one \nsource of funds to attract and match funds from \n\nother sources. It is an effective means of bringing in \n\nadditional money to support an expanding project \n\nor one with an extended timeline. \n  Consider what can be accomplished without \nTheodosia Stewardship Roundtable state that \n\nplanning groups do not need a lot of money to \ninitiate watershed planning. In-kind contributions \n\ngetting a project started. Once successes \n\nstart to be demonstrated through the use \n\nof these contributions, it becomes easier to \nattract funds from other sources. Participants \n\nin the Theodosia planning process expect that \n\ndown the road, when they have established a \ngood mechanism for making watershed-based decisions, their Roundtable will actually attract \nmoney rather than cost money. They expect that \n\noutside funders will see value in the process, and \n\nwill want to support it. Consider Alternative Sources of FundsVarious means of generating funds for water \nmanagement projects have been tried in different \ncommunities. Some of these are listed below. It \nis important to consider the potential that these \nmay bring, within the context of each community. \n\nConducting an economic analysis of which \nmechanisms are most appropriate to a community \n\npublic and political support for those mechanisms. \n  Development Cost Charges (DCCs) have been \nused in some BC communities to support \n\noperational initiatives in water management. As \n\na pilot project, the town of Oliver, BC received \n\napproval to use DCC funds collected from new \n\ndevelopment to help establish water meters for \nexisting homes with the resulting water savings \nbecoming available to provide water services to \n\nnew homes. DCCs have also been a key part of \n\nthe City of Surrey™s strategy to build sustainable \n\ndrainage infrastructure. Surrey has used the funds \n\nto pay for a roadside storm water management \n\nswale/multi-use greenway in a new development, \n\nrather than the usual purchase of 5-6% of the \narea for the purposes of a detention pond. \n  Volume-based Water Use Fees can be applied \neither to individuals or water suppliers to target \n\nheavy-use water consumers and to provide \n\nincentives for water conservation. The fee structure \n\nneeds to be equitable to avoid creating economic \n\nhardship for low-income residents and the \n\nagricultural community. \n  Municipal Drainage Utilities can be formed as an alternate source of raising funding. This \n\napproach can help ensure dedicated funding for \n\ndrainage and stormwater planning, infrastructure \n\nand operations.  Water Licence Fees collected by the Ministry of Forests, Lands and Natural \nResource Operations currently go into provincial general revenue. In theory, \n\n\n\nwatershed planning. If local government becomes actively involved in licence \n\nadministration at any level, some of these funds could be used to fund water \nconservation and management projects at the local level.\n16   Recreational User Fees applied to powerboat or off-road vehicle rentals are a \nmeans of targeting polluting activities of tourists or seasonal residents who do \n\nnot otherwise contribute funds to water management in a region.\n16  Reserve Funds can be established by implementing changes in service delivery \nsystems (e.g., contracting out a regional service), which can sometimes translate \n\ninto savings for a local government. In the Region of Peel, in Ontario, such a savings \n\ntranslated into a permanent, annual cost reduction of 1.5% on water rates. Staff \n\ncommitment and forward thinking leadership enabled these savings to be channeled \ninto a fund, which is not constrained by the normal budget cycle. The City of Toronto \ndirected revenue from property sales into the\n ﬁToronto Atmospheric Revolving Fundﬂ\n, \n\n\nroyalties from these projects are returned to the fund. One merit of this approach is \n\nthat it does not require any additional taxation. \n8.5 INFORMATION AND KNOWLEDGEThe importance of accurate, relevant and meaningful data, information and \nknowledge cannot be underestimated in relation to water and watershed planning. \nAlthough subtle nuances differentiate data from information and knowledge, for the \npurposes of this section of the guide, the term ﬁinformationﬂ will be used explicitly, and \n\ndata and knowledge will be considered as being related implicitly.\nInformation is critical to water and watershed planning in a variety of ways. Information \n\nand decision makers about the need for planning, policy and/or operational \n\nmanagement actions. Information about future scenarios, such as population \nprojections or climate change scenarios, can help inform planners and others about \npossible issues they may need to address. Information about the effectiveness of \nmanagement options can be used to assess recommended actions in response to \ncurrent or future challenges.\n8.5.1 INFORMATION NEEDS AND SOURCES\n\nor necessary to inform a water and watershed planning process:\nCurrent and projected future water supply:\n \n Surface and groundwater reserves (extent and volume);\n Changes to precipitation and evapotranspiration as a result of climate change; and,\n Changes to storage and distribution capacity associated with water supplies.Current and projected future water demand:\n Current water use by all human consumptive and non-consumptive uses;\n \nfunctions; and,  Changes to water demand as a result of population growth, community and \neconomic development and/or climate change.Current and projected future threats to water quality:\n Changes to settlement patterns, land use and associated pollutants; and,\n  Changes to hydrology and geomorphology as a result of land use, land cover\n and/or climate change.Data and information are also needed to monitor and measure performance in relation to \nthe objectives and desired outcomes of a water or watershed plan (or related regulatory \nrequirements). For example, it may be necessary to monitor compliance with water \n\n\nriparian area regulations and/or water quality standards or objectives. If performance \nmeasures are not established and assessed, it may not be possible to determine if the \ngoals and objectives of a water or watershed plan are being achieved.\n46', 'Some examples of information sources to support water and watershed planning \nare listed below (in alphabetical order). In many cases, further analysis of available \n\ninformation and/or more detailed local information will be necessary to support \n\nplanning processes. See Section 9 of this guide Tools and Resources for more \n\ninformation (including web links) about where to go for relevant information on \n\nwater, watershed and climate science.\n BC Hydro Œ Regional Hydromet Data \n BC Ministry of Environment Œ Environmental Protection Division, Water Quality \n BC Ministry of Environment Œ Groundwater Wells and Aquifer Database\n  BC Ministry of Forests, Lands & Natural Resource Operations \n Œ River Forecast Centre \n Environment Canada Œ Meteorological Service \n Environment Canada Œ Real-Time Hydrometric Data \n \n8.5.2 INFORMATION GAPS AND LIMITATIONSData for water, watershed and climate change planning is not available consistently \nacross the province. Numerous information gaps present a challenge to water and \n\nwatershed planning. For example, there may be gaps or limitations in:\n  Spatial coverage (e.g., available information may not cover a particular river, \nstream, lake or watershed);\n  Temporal coverage (e.g., a full range of historical or current information, \n or future projections may not be available); and,\n  \nMeasured parameters (e.g., information may be available for only a subset \n of the necessary water quantity or quality variables).Basic hydrological information is not available for many streams, lakes and aquifers in \nBC. Similarly, water quality information is limited. Although there are requirements for \n\nmeasuring and reporting on drinking water quality, there are many information gaps \n\non instream water quality for waterbodies that are not used for drinking water.\nIn some regions, such as the Capital Regional District, where communities \nare close to academic institutions, there is a relatively good supply of data \n\nand information to inform planning efforts. However, in small to mid-sized \n\ncommunities, less data is available both for climate and water and watershed \nplanning. Also, in some cases, loal governments do not always know what data \n\nare available or how to source or use the data. \nWhile it is widely recognized that in many regions of the province aquifers are \nvulnerable to multiple sources of depletion and pollution, groundwater data are \n\nrelatively limited. The submission of well log information, which is housed by the \n\nProvince, is voluntary, and people are often slow in submitting the data or they \n\nprovide incomplete information. Accessing data for privately held upland areas \n\n\n\n\n\nhowever, this information typically is not made available. \nCommunities may be able to acquire data, but in many cases it is not in an \naccessible format. Local governments have experienced considerable challenges \nrelated to the format and completeness of data. Often, data are developed for \n\n\n\n\n\ndeveloping plans for a particular region or watershed. Regional districts report \n\nthat it is sometimes challenging to work with data from various member \n\nmunicipalities because there is no standardized format for the data. Finally, the \n\nlevel of detail in which data are presented is not always useful. For example, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nunderstanding the complexity of watershed resources, health and function. In \n\nan ideal scenario, a watershed inventory and assessment is undertaken to build \na broad understanding of the full resources, functions and characteristics of a\n \nwatershed. In many cases, watershed inventories and assessments have not 1   Brandes, Oliver et. al. (2005).
