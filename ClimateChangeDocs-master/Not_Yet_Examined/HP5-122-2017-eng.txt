The \nLancet Commission (2015) speaks to the many and \nserious impacts of climate change on health, and how addressing these could be ﬁthe greatest \nglobal health opportunity of the 21st centuryﬂ. Extreme weather events and increased \nclimate variability associated with climate change exacerbate current public health challenges \nglobally, and present new risks to populations. For Canada, various effects of climate change \nplay a signi˜cant compounding factor that negatively affects the health and resilience of \nvulnerable communities. Notable direct and indirect impacts include:\nŁ Droughts and ˚ooding and the links with incidence of water-borne diseases and to \npsychosocial effects\nŁ Food security and the nutritional status of individuals, which further undermine resistance \nto diseasesŁ Heat-related morbidity and mortality as well as compounding health issues related to poor \nair quality such as asthma, allergies, respiratory diseases, cancer, cardiovascular diseases \nand stroke \nŁ The spread of disease vectors favouring the emergence and re-emergence of infectious \ndiseasesŁ Natural disasters and the loss of land, cultural heritage, natural resources and property with \nsigni˜cant impact on mental health and well-beingŁ Special challenges and impacts on northern Canadians such as dangerous travel, damaged \ninfrastructure, threats to traditional food sources, disappearance of drinking water sources \nand related psychosocial and cultural impacts\nŁ Sustainable healthcare in a changing climate presents future risks to Canadians as its \ncapacity is strained in various ways (aging population, resource intensive infrastructure, \nbudget constraints)', '2As the impact of climate change further highlights weaknesses in many systems, a social determinants of health approach to considering the changing climate would add great value \nin national efforts toward reducing vulnerability and risk (e.g. addressing food security, \navailability of potable water, safe housing, working conditions, stable income, and sustainable \ndevelopment). This would support a more integrated or horizontal approach whereby \nadaptation frameworks are informed by different perspectives. Many authors argue that most \nmitigation and adaptation responses to climate change are ﬁno-regretﬂ options, which lead \n to direct reductions in the burden of ill-health, enhance community resilience, alleviate poverty, \nand address global inequity. It is important for all sectors to bring their unique positions and \nperspectives together to de˜ne future considerations in governance and actions towards \nsuccessful adaptations for mitigating health impacts of climate change in Canada and globally. \n', '31.0 HEALTH IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE\nRisks to the health of Canadians from climate change include direct and indirect illnesses\n1 and deaths related to poor air quality, water- and food-borne contamination, changing patterns of \ndiseases spread by animals, ticks and insects, and extreme weather events including extreme \nheat events and urban heat islands. Human-generated greenhouse gas emissions\n2 (GHGs) \ncontribute to climate change and these gas emissions derive in part from aspects of the built \nenvironment\n3 such as transportation systems and infrastructure, building construction and \noperation, and land-use planning (1,2). Special challenges and impacts on northern Canadians are already being observed such as more \ndangerous travel (unusual changes in ice, snow and land conditions), damaged infrastructure \ndue to permafrost melt, threats to traditional food sources, disappearance of drinking water \nsources and related-psychosocial and cultural impacts. Those most vulnerable are facing several \ncompounding risks such as chronic health conditions, multiple environmental hazard exposures, \nthe extremes of age, socio-economic deprivation, physical and/or social isolation. Sustainable \nhealthcare in a changing climate presents further risks to Canadians as its capacity is strained \nin many ways such as from the aging population, resource intensive infrastructure, professional \nneeds and budget constraints (1). \nKey areas of health risks linked to climate change are now examined.\n1 Such as: asthma, respiratory allergies, and airway diseases, cancer, heat-related morbidity and mortality, human developmental \neffects, cardiovascular disease and stroke, mental health and stress-related disorders, foodborne diseases and nutrition, neurological \ndiseases and disorders, vector-borne and zoonotic diseases, waterborne diseases, weather-related morbidity and mortality. \n2 These are gases that trap heat in the atmosphere.\n3 The built environment means the buildings, transportation systems, energy systems, open space, and agricultural \nlands that make up and support our communities (Toronto Public Health;\n www1.toronto.ca/wps/portal/\ncontentonly?vgnextoid=d06e23bf6d481410VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD)', '41.1 INFECTIOUS DISEASEThere is consensus that climate change is affecting human health. The linkages between public \nhealth and climate change are complex and interact with other factors. Arthropod-borne \ndiseases are infections spread by insect (e.g. mosquitoes and sand˚ies) or arachnid (e.g. ticks) \nvectors. Major shifts in the epidemiology of several vector-borne diseases and appearances on \n new continents have been predicted as a result of climate change (3,4). Climate change \n is likely to have both direct and indirect impacts on the burden of West Nile fever, dengue, \nChickungunya fever, malaria, leishmaniasis, tick-borne encephalitis, Lyme borreliosis, Crimean-\nCongo haemorrhagic fever, spotted fever rickettsioses, Yellow fever, Zika and Rift˛Valley fever \n(5,6). Population mobility is a main factor in globalization of public health threats and risks due to \ninfectious diseases. Traditional health policy approaches have focused on diseases of global \npublic health signi˜cance such as tuberculosis, Yellow fever, and cholera; however, new diseases \nand resistant organisms challenge existing approaches. Clinical implications and health policy \nchallenges associated with movement of persons across barriers permeable to products, \npathogens, and toxins (e.g. geopolitical borders, patient care environments) are complex. \nOutcomes are complicated by high numbers of persons who move across disparate and diverse \nsettings of disease threat and risk. Existing policies and processes merit an approach to global \npublic health risk management that integrates population factors with effective and timely \napplication of policies and processes˛(7,8).\nThe incidence, outbreak frequency, and distribution of many infectious diseases are generally \nexpected to change as a consequence of different factors related to climate change. Temperature \nand precipitation patterns in˚uence food- and water-borne diseases. Changes in seasonal \nprecipitation and temperature in˚uence vector-borne diseases through \ni. effects on vector survival, \nreproduction rates, habitat suitability, distribution, and abundance; \nii. the intensity and temporal \npattern of vector activity (biting rates); and \niii. rates of pathogen development, survival, and \nreproduction within vectors. The projected climate changes may shift the distributional ranges \nof vector-borne diseases (5,6). As an example, the number of tick-borne diseases of humans has \nincreased in incidence and geographic range over the past few decades, and there is concern that \nthey will pose an even greater threat to public health in the future. Global warming is often cited \nas˛the underlying mechanism favouring the spread of tick-borne diseases, as climate will in˚uence \nwhich tick species are found in a given geographic region, their population density, the likelihood \nthat they will be infected with microbes pathogenic for humans, and the frequency of tick-human \ncontact. Changes in climate will in˚uence spread and survival of other insect vectors including \nmosquitoes, ˚eas, sand˚ies, tsetse ˚ies, and house˚ies, known to carry highly pathogenic microorganisms infecting man. Given the pace of international travel the global consequences \nto these changes are currently unknown. Another concern with increasing temperatures is that \nancient bacteria and viruses could re-emerge and revive as global warming melts ice at the poles \nexposing long dormant organisms. An example is the August 2016 Anthrax outbreak in the \nRussian Federation which was triggered by ice melt in temperatures of 35°C in the Arctic Circle\n4. This brought anthrax spores to the surface. Animal contact with those spores and then subsequent \nhuman infection resulted in the hospitalisation of 97 people and a child™s death. These situations \nhighlight similar potential risks to vulnerable populations living in areas with diminishing ice cover \nand thawing permafrost. \n4 Anthrax outbreak triggered by climate change kills boy in Arctic Circle. 1Aug2016 The Guardian \n www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/01/anthrax-outbreak-climate-change-arctic-circle-russia.\n Accessed 5Oct2016', '51.2 FOOD SAFETY AND SECURITYThere are other diseases that are likely to be exacerbated in a warmer world including \nfood-borne and respiratory diseases. It has been shown that reported cases of salmonellosis \nand campylobacteriosis peak in the hot summer months and that this association was \nobserved at temperatures greater than 37.5°C (9). In Canada, some experts may consider \nthe effect of climate change on food-borne diseases to be minimal providing appropriate \nfood handling and storage procedures and improved food hygiene (10).\nIndigenous Peoples are among the most vulnerable to climate change and experience \ndistinctive challenges (11), particularly those living in remote locations. A range of factors \nthat apply to each vulnerability assessment are layered with issues that are unique to \nIndigenous communities and culture to varying degrees. These may include reliance on the \nrapidly changing natural environment for cultural, social, mental and physical health and \nwell-being, and livelihoods. Historical legacies have in˚uenced development of Indigenous communities in Canada. Many have a number of socio-economic challenges, including \ndisproportionate ˜scal and population pressures; sub-standard infrastructure; and limited \naccess to health services (12). Many of these factors are exacerbated by the more dramatic \nimpacts of climate change in extreme environments. Food security and access to potable water \nare fundamental to health. Store-bought food and water are extremely expensive in remote \nareas. This combined with decreased access to traditional food sources and increasingly \nexpensive and undependable conditions for safe and affordable transportation in remote \nregions are deepening existing food and water security concerns (13). Household food \ninsecurity has been associated with a range of poor physical and mental health outcomes, including multiple chronic conditions and depression (14,15).\n', '61.3 WATERBORNE DISEASE\nWaterborne diseases are also likely to be in˚uenced by climate change. The importance \nof˛climate as a driver of disease risk is derived from observations that waterborne disease \noutbreaks are often preceded by heavy rainfall. This link is likely to be most obvious for \ninadequately treated water or small rural supplies. Several authors have pointed out links \nbetween cholera and climate variables especially with higher temperature and rainfall, \n˚ooding and major climatic cycles such as El Niño. Cyanobacteria are present in drinking \nand recreational waters and most reported human cases were associated with observable \ncyanobacterial blooms with known neurotoxicity. The impact of droughts on health through \nreduced agricultural productivity and access to water in af˚uent countries is not clear, but \neffects in resource poor countries are likely to be dramatic (16).\n1.4 EXTREME WEATHER \nExtreme weather events pose particular challenges to populations. The frequency and \nintensity of extreme weather events is predicted to rise as a result of climate variability. \nBeyond physical damage, effects of disasters such as ˚oods, extreme droughts, storms \nand˛hurricanes on human health seem to be mostly indirect (mediated through vector and \nwaterborne diseases). Acute injuries, fatalities and mental health illnesses are also signi˜cant \npublic health outcomes and their management and prevention require disaster preparedness \nand response planning (17,18). \nDisasters signi˜cantly impede progress towards sustainable development (19). This is of \nparticular relevance internationally through the sustainable development goals and nationally \nthrough the revised Federal Sustainable Development Strategy\n5. Evidence indicates \nthat˛exposure of persons and assets in all countries has increased faster than vulnerability \n5 Planning for a Sustainable Future: A Federal Sustainable Development Strategy for Canada. \n www.fsds-sfdd.ca/index.html#/en/detail/all/\n', '7has decreased, thus generating new risks and a steady rise in disaster related losses, with \na˛signi˜cant economic, social, health, cultural and environmental impact in the short, medium \nand long term, especially at the local and community levels. Recurring small-scale disasters and \nslow-onset disasters particularly affect communities, households and small and medium-sized \nenterprises, constituting a high percentage of all losses. All countries are faced with increasing \nlevels of possible hidden or unanticipated costs and challenges in order to meet ˜nancial and \nother obligations (19).1.5 EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT, HEALTH SECURITY \nAND GLOBAL STABILITY\nBetween 2008 and 2012 there were 144 million people displaced by disasters (20) with people \nin vulnerable situations affected disproportionately. This represents a population larger than the \ncombined populations of Britain and France. For some disasters the effect of the displacement \ncan be indirect such as with environmental refugees, or that new con˚icts arise due to scarcity of \nbasic resources (20). The problems of heat stress and heat stress-related mortality are considered \nan area of major direct impact because of the severity of the outcome (death) and increased \npressure on governments to respond. An example is the intense 2003 European heat wave, which \ncaused the death of more than 35,000 mainly elderly persons (21). \nEvent coincidence analysis was used to investigate data from armed-con˚ict outbreaks and \nclimate-related natural disasters for the period 1980Œ2010 (22). A coincidence rate of 9% \nregarding armed-con˚ict outbreak and disaster occurrence such as heat waves or droughts was \nobserved. During this period, about 23% of con˚ict outbreaks in ethnically highly fractionalized \ncountries robustly coincided with climatic calamities. Although climate-related disasters do not \nact as direct triggers of armed con˚icts, the disruptive nature of these events seems to play out \nin ethnically fractionalized societies in a particularly tragic way. This observation has important \nimplications for future security policies as several of the world™s most con˚ict-prone regions, \nincluding North and Central Africa as well as Central Asia. Both of these areas are exceptionally \nvulnerable to anthropogenic climate change and characterized by deep ethnic divides (22). \nMedical countermeasures (MCMs), such as anthrax vaccine, are therapeutic products (i.e., drugs, \nvaccines, and medical devices, as de˜ned by the Food and Drugs Act) which aim to prevent, \nmitigate or treat the adverse health effects of a public health event or emergency. Globally, \nMCMs play a critical role in addressing all manner of health security threats. This is highly \nrelevant with regards to climate change impacts on the evolving public health threat and risk \nlandscape. Increased movement of people and goods leads to increased risk of disease \ntransmission; emerging and re-emerging infectious disease outbreaks, including antimicrobial-\nresistant pathogens; and increased risk of terrorism threat agents due to evolving geo-political \nlandscapes. Ongoing awareness and foresight in ensuring that effective and relevant MCMs \nare˛developed and acquired for use to protect Canadians is a key area of responsibility for the \nfederal government. \nThe uncertainty and potentially extreme impacts of these types of events on health security \nin Canada and globally are important considerations in emergency preparedness and \nresponse systems™ evolution, innovation and responsiveness. \n', '81.6 CHRONIC DISEASEThere is an emerging literature about the pathways by which climate change can have \nan˛impact on health and non-communicable diseases (18). For example air pollution, \nincreased heat exposure and changes to agricultural systems (land use) have been linked \nto˛the built environment (23) with aspects such as walkability, travel, and vehicle emissions. \nFurthermore, scienti˜c evidence has linked air pollution to cardiovascular diseases (24), \nasthma and lung cancer (25), neurological diseases (26), diabetes (26) and symptoms \nof˛depression (27). Air˛pollution is also associated with decreased physical activity among \nadults of normal weight (28). \nExtreme heat events have been linked to increases in hospital admissions for respiratory, \nkidney and heart-related conditions (28); the effects can be made worse due to the urban \nheat island effect and the types of built structures and the materials used (23). \nUrbanization, with its high levels of vehicle emissions, extreme temperatures and \nwesternized lifestyle, is˛linked to the rising frequency of respiratory allergic diseases and \ncardiovascular disease observed over recent decades in most industrialized countries. \nConcentrations of air pollutants (mainly ozone and particulate matter) increase with \ngreenhouse gas emissions and˛higher temperatures (24). The main driver of respiratory \ndisease is air pollution itself˛rather than climate change and the main intervention for \nrespiratory diseases is˛emission reduction. \nThere is a risk of increased exposure to toxic chemicals, known or suspected to cause \ncancer, that are released into the environment following thawing permafrost, heavy rainfall \nor˛˚ooding and by increased volatilization of chemicals under conditions of increased \ntemperature (25). Cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and respiratory disease are the \nleading causes of preventable death and disability in Canada (26). Reducing risk of these \nchronic diseases through innovations to the built environment, active living and personal \nbehavioural change present a unique opportunity for strategic public health innovation (28). \nThis presents a classic example of possible health adaptations to climate change that both \nreduce vulnerability and enhance community resilience. \n', '91.7 MENTAL HEALTH\nClimate change affects mental health due to changes in the prevalence and severity of \nnatural disasters on human settlements. These events can cause anxiety-related responses \nand later potentially lead to chronic and severe mental health disorders, with implications \nfor mental health systems and supports (27). These effects will fall disproportionately on \nindividuals who are already vulnerable, especially for Indigenous people and those living \nin˛low-resource settings (30). Additionally, individuals might feel a distressing sense of \n loss that people experience when their land is damaged and they lose amenities and \nopportunity (31). The mental health effects of these losses are becoming evident in many \nIndigenous communities where connectivity to the land is integral to psychological, physical \nand cultural wellbeing. Changing climatic conditions are causing a variety of changes to \nthe˛land, sea and snow environments, which are impacting the security of spirituality, food, \ntravel and culture (14). Elevated levels of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress \ndisorders have been reported in populations who have experienced \n˚ooding and during \nslow-developing events such as prolonged droughts; impacts include chronic distress and \nincreased incidence of suicide (32,33). Even in high-income regions where the humanitarian \ncrisis might be less, the impact on the local economy, damaged homes, and economic losses \ncan persist for years after natural disasters (34). Government and agencies now emphasise \npsychological and psychosocial interventions within disaster response and emergency \nmanagement. Social adaptation processes can mediate public risk perceptions and \nunderstanding, psychological and social impacts, coping responses, and behavioural \nadaptation (35).', '101.8 PHYSICAL ACTIVITYAs the climate changes, various impacts on the ability to be physically active, as well as impacts on those who are being physically active, are in evidence. Conditions that are known \nto be associated with physical activity, such as obesity, pulmonary and cardiac health, and \nmental health are thus being in˚uenced both directly and indirectly by climate change. \nOutdoor activities can be limited by increased heat and air pollution (36). Longer-term shifts in \nenvironmental conditions, such as shorter seasons with snow and ice, can both provide \nopportunities for some outdoor activities (hiking, walking, cycling) or decrease others and their \nhazards (skiing, snowmobiling; sunburns, avalanche risk). A signi˜cant source of climate \nchange comes from private motor vehicles emissions and home energy expenditure (e.g. \nhome heating and cooling). Urban planning, which supports more compact living and \nsustainable transportation such as transit and active transportation, would reduce greenhouse \ngas emissions and encourage greater physical activity and its associated health bene˜ts (37). \nAs a result, bene˜ts from policies and programs aimed at mitigating climate change at the \nindividual level, and particularly in the transportation sector, also have the bene˜t of increasing \nactive transportation and as a result physical activity levels (38).\n', '112.0 ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE RISKS \nTO HEALTH\n6ﬁMuch of the potential health impact of climate change can however be avoided through \na˚combination of strengthening key health system functions and improved management \nof˚the risks presented by a changing climate.ﬂ\n7 As the climate continues to change and impacts on health are increasingly evident, adaptation is needed to reduce growing risks \nto˛vulnerable populations and communities. \nSuccessful adaptation requires intersectoral collaboration (e.g. health, environment, planning, \ntransport, infrastructure) on monitoring and surveillance of climate change health outcomes, \naddressing root causes that limit preparedness (e.g. poverty), identi˜cation of vulnerable \npopulations, reducing uncertainty through increased research on impacts, educating the \npublic and decision makers about potential disasters and the bene˜ts of preparedness, \nand˛the ˜nancing of needed measures. Adaptations are most effective when they maximize \nco-bene˜ts (e.g. increase social capital, improve urban design) that address related health \nconcerns, and when they are mainstreamed into existing programs and planning. For instance, \nfederal departments are mandated by the \nCabinet Directive on the Environmental Assessment \nof˚Policy, Plan, and Program Proposals (Cabinet Directive)\n to complete Strategic Environmental \nAssessments (SEAs) for all policy, plan, and program proposals (39). Completing a SEA\n (40) \nensures that decision makers at all levels have taken economic, social, and environmental \nconsiderations into account to make informed decisions in support of sustainable development. \n2.1 ADAPTATION MEASURES AND STRATEGIES \nTO˜PROTECT HEALTH\nThere is now a large body of scienti˜c work to frame the concept of adaption in a changing \nclimate. Decision makers across health issue ˜les and different levels of government have \nexchanged knowledge and promising practices in health promotion, public health intervention, \nand emergency management. Despite this, Canada does not have a comprehensive and \nsystematic framework to address the interface between climate change and health. In moving \ntowards this, it is important to have a shared understanding of key concepts that underpin \nthis˛process.\nAdaptation to climate change is commonly de˜ned as ‚the process of adjustment to actual \nor expected climate and its effects, in human systems in order to moderate harm or exploit \nbene˜cial opportunities, and in natural systems human intervention may facilitate adjustment to expected climate™ (41). 6 Section 2.0 is adapted from ‚Canada in a Changing Climate: Sector Perspectives on Impacts and Adaptation™ (2014).\n7 Protecting Health from Climate Change. Vulnerability and Adaptation Assessment. 2013. WHO Report\n', '12Vulnerability\n is commonly de˜ned as the degree to which a system or person is susceptible \nto, or unable to cope with, the adverse effects of climate change (42). This de\n˜nition considers demographics, geographical circumstances, effectiveness, and coverage of the health-care \nsystem, pre-existing conditions, and socioeconomic factors such as inequity (43). \nResilience is commonly de˜ned as the capacity of a system to absorb disturbance and \nreorganize while undergoing change, so as to still retain essentially the same function, structure, \nidentity and feedbacks. Resilience has also been referred to as the ability of human communities \nto withstand external shocks to their social infrastructure (44). Resilience includes the capacity \nof a system to not only absorb a disturbance, but to innovate and transform (45).\nAdaptive actions to address climate change in the health sector require action across the whole \nspectrum of public health core functions (promotion, protection, prevention, public health \nsurveillance and emergency preparedness) (46). The scale up of adaptive actions to Federal/\nProvincial/Territorial (F/P/T) jurisdictions has been currently limited by the breadth and depth \nof˛the knowledge uptake as well as cross disciplinary application, commonly referred to as \nﬁmainstreamingﬂ. Understanding of adaptation options that can be taken by public health and \nemergency management of˜cials to build resilience has increased, although information \nabout adaptation success is limited. Measures identi˜ed in recent literature address climate \nchange risks to health, and build upon the list of public health adaptations presented by Séguin \n(2008) (1). Overall, new adaptation areas of focus by public health of˜cials and researchers \ninclude:Ł Horizontal cross-cutting needs to understand vulnerability and strengthen resilience such as: \nVulnerability assessments of high risk populations; Actions to address secondary health \neffects of climate hazards such as psychosocial impacts; Use of new technologies to facilitate \nadoption of individual adaptive behaviours (e.g. use of automated devices in cars to warn \nof water depth or landslide early detection systems); Advice to health care providers about \nactions they can take to reduce climate-related health risks; Emergency management \nplanning measures tailored to increase the resiliency of health care facilities from climate \nchange; and Identi˜cation of preventative measures to reduce harmful exposures before \nnegative health outcomes occur (e.g. infrastructure development such as green roofs to \nreduce the urban heat island)\nŁ Extreme heat and air pollution such as: Health impacts from higher temperatures, \nincreased frequency and severity of heat waves, increased air pollution; Air conditioning, \nduring extreme events, with the caveat that seasonal use contributes to climate change \nand˛air pollution through greater use of fossil fuel; additionally seasonal use interrupts \nthe˛human body™s ability to acclimate to regional weather which increases the individual™s \nvulnerability; Better quality housing stock, appropriate infrastructure with the ability \nto˛capture energy and recycle water; Infrastructure development such as green roofs, \nre˚ective road and building surfaces, urban green spaces, interior air sealing, use \nof˛elastomeric roof coating; Public awareness and education campaigns to promote \npersonal protection from air pollution (e.g. Air Quality Health Index or AQHI\n8); \nVulnerability assessments of high risk regions/populations; Physician attention \n8 De˜nitions as per Environment and Climate Change Canada. \nwww.ec.gc.ca/cas-aqhi/default.asp?lang=En&n=CB0ADB16-1\n.

Speci˜cally, it is one of the leading countries with respect to the depth \nof˛research being led on vulnerability, to the impacts of climate change and adaptation \noptions within the health sector. It is also one of the few countries to recognize and \ndevelop speci˜c adaptation options around vulnerabilities of Indigenous Peoples. Health \nadaptation efforts ongoing at federal, provincial, territorial and local levels related \nto˛assessing vulnerabilities, preparing for the impacts and communicating health risks to \nCanadians were examined. Neither a comprehensive inventory of all local and regional \nadaptations (e.g. infectious disease surveillance, emergency management programs), nor \na˛comprehensive assessment of the state of health adaptation in Canada are available \nat˛this time. However, communities can draw from information from various sources in order \nto set priorities, select appropriate strategies and implement them in a sustainable manner \nas a complement to existing programs, to protect and enhance health in their respective \njurisdictions. \n2.2.1 ASSESSING IMPACTS AND VULNERABILITIES\nClimate change and health vulnerability assessments help identify populations in a community \nor region who are vulnerable to the impacts, gauge the effectiveness of existing interventions \nand programs, identify additional measures necessary to respond to climate change, strengthen \ncapacity to take action, and provide a baseline of information to monitor adaptation progress. \nThe World Health Organization (WHO) recently released new guidelines for assessing \nhealth vulnerabilities to climate change and adaptation options and Health Canada released \nguidelines for assessing the vulnerability of communities and individuals to extreme heat. \nSuch˛assessments rely on monitoring and surveillance data illustrating health impact trends \nassociated with climate variability and change. Gaps in data exist for many climate change impacts of concern to Canadians. Cheng and Berry (2013) have identi˜ed a key basket of climate \nchange and health indicators that can be used by health authorities to track impacts on health \nover time (25). At present, few health authorities at regional and local levels have conducted full \nclimate change and health vulnerability assessments. Analysis of possible health impacts from \nclimate change have been undertaken in British Columbia (48). Ontario™s Adaptation Strategy \nand Action Plan 2011Œ2014 (49) recognized extreme heat events as a key health concern and \ncommitted to the creation of a heat vulnerability assessment tool. At the local level, Peel Public \nHealth (Ontario) used the new WHO guidelines to conduct a health vulnerability assessment \nthat will contribute to implementation of the Region of Peel Climate Change Strategy (50). \nIn˛addition, some public health authorities and their partners are currently undertaking or have \nundertaken research projects that contribute to knowledge of local vulnerability to speci˜c \nhealth impacts. Expertise on climate change and health issues is growing and many universities \nand organizations across Canada are undertaking research in this area.\n', '162.2.2 PREPARING FOR THE IMPACTS\nProtecting health from climate change impacts requires ﬁmainstreamingﬂ climate change \nconsiderations into existing risk assessment and management activities. Mainstreaming is based \non ﬁ˚exibleﬂ adaptation and institutional learning, which is responsive to changing risks to \nhealth, climate surprises, and individual- and community-level vulnerabilities. Mainstreaming \naims to reduce duplication and contradictions between existing public health interventions \nand new adaptations developed in response to climate change. Evidence of mainstreaming \nin˛provincial and territorial policies, regulatory instruments and planning tools includes \nStrategic Direction 1 in the \nﬁQuebec In Action Œ Greener by 2020: Government Strategy for \nClimate Change Adaptationﬂ (51) that integrates climate change adaptation into government \nadministration by modifying, where needed, the content of laws, regulations, strategies, \npolicies, and planning tools. In Nunavut, the climate change adaptation plan requires all \ndepartments and agencies to ﬁ[...] integrate climate change projections, impacts, and best \npractices in all levels of their decision-making in order to implement a comprehensive \nresponse to climate changeﬂ\n (52).One study in Ontario found evidence of adaptation through the mainstreaming of climate \nchange into existing public health programs (50). Outside of government, the Insurance \nBureau of˛Canada is developing a municipal risk assessment tool (53) that can help community \ndecision makers use climate change information to address infrastructure vulnerabilities to \nprojected ˚ood events. Other initiatives also contribute to reducing health risks from climate \nchange. Many health authorities utilize HARS (heat alert response systems), air pollution \nmonitoring activities, and programs to raise awareness of vector-borne diseases, which helps to \nmanage a˛range of climate-related impacts.\nFor example, the provinces of Manitoba, Quebec, and Nova Scotia have provincial \nHARS˛(50) in place while Alberta is initiating one, and health authorities in Ontario are \ncollaborating to maximize the effectiveness and integration of local systems. In addition, \nsome˛activities that were not developed with the primary purpose of protecting health can \nindirectly help to improve health and wellbeing and thereby reduce the impacts of climate \nchange (e.g. Drought Response Plan by the British Columbia Inter-Agency Drought Working \nGroup) (54). New approaches and tools have been developed that could facilitate efforts to \nassist vulnerable groups in Canada and improve understanding of adaptation options at the \nindividual and community levels. 2.2.3 COMMUNICATING HEALTH RISKS TO THE PUBLIC\nThere are few formal evaluations of public education efforts to reduce health risks associated with \nclimate change. Those that have been completed show mixed results. A study of the education \ncampaign in Montreal, Quebec indicated that people who have been exposed to education \nmaterials were more likely to take protective measures against heat through, for example, the use \nof lightweight clothing, avoiding strenuous exercise, taking a shower or bath to cool down, \nand hydration. However, other studies suggest that while knowledge of heat warnings is very \nbroad (>90%), protective actions taken by individuals are inadequate or that perceptions \nof˛health risks are generally low and the adoption of preventative actions is not widespread. \n', '17Research on levels of public awareness and the effectiveness of health promotion campaigns \nrelated to˛air quality advisories, food safety and reducing risks from vector-borne diseases \nshow similarly mixed results. Public awareness messaging on climate-related risks can be \ncontradictory (e.g. exercising later in the day to avoid extreme heat versus not going outdoors \nat night to avoid contracting West Nile Virus). To maximize effectiveness, health promotion \nprograms should develop consistent messaging across health issue areas.\n2.2.4 HEALTH RELATED RESEARCH NEEDS\nOver the last 15 years, calls for expanded research efforts on climate-related health risks have \nresulted in a growing body of research to help guide actions to protect the health of Canadians. \nMany gaps in health related research areas would still bene˜t from integration and collaboration \nwith non-health sectors, as well as across government, academia and the private sector. \nStrides have been made in the areas of air quality, extreme heat, and the understanding of some \nclimate-related infectious diseases. Although it is important to understand and recognize how \nfar˛Canada has come, knowledge development has not been uniform among issue areas nor \nacross regions of Canada. The following examples are recognised gaps where integrated \nresearch could maximise ef˜cient delivery of diversely useful outcomes. \nŁ Air Quality: Estimates of the contribution of black carbon emissions in Canada originating \nfrom sources such as: Open biomass burning and wood stove burning; Identi˜cation of the \nextent of proliferation, impact and allergenicity of aeroallergen-producing plants as warming \ncontinues; Identi˜cation and monitoring of potentially invasive fungal diseases that could \nestablish with climate change; Understanding of the effects of various GHG mitigation and \nadaptation activities (e.g. energy ef˜ciency trade-offs, green roofs) on ambient and indoor \nair quality and associated health impacts; Understanding of how heat and poor air quality \ninteract to impact health and adaptive strategies to reduce health risks; and, Identi˜cation \nof˛how dampness and temperature affect degradation of materials in buildings and how \nindoor material product design may affect human exposure to chemicals.\nŁ Food and Water Quality: \nUnderstanding of the impact of water contaminants on human health and monitoring of illnesses; Monitoring of food-borne illness cases to reduce \nunderreporting, including attention to emergence or re-emergence of speci˜c diseases; \nKnowledge of the impacts of climate change on food and water security in northern and \nsouthern Canada; Understanding of the capacity and preparedness of water utilities to adapt \nto climate change; and, De˜ning the characteristics of resilient water and food \nmanagement systems.Ł Zoonoses and Vector-borne Diseases:\n Surveillance for zoonoses, vectors and vector-borne \ndiseases, including attention to emergence of novel diseases; Basic and applied research \nstudies to inform the development of surveillance, prevention and control methods, vaccines \nand licensed products for vector control; and, Enhanced capacity to train highly quali˜ed \npersonnel for both research and public health activities.\nŁ Natural Hazards:\n Improved projections of extreme weather events due to climate change \nand modelling of possible health impacts; Surveillance of direct and indirect health impacts \nfrom extreme weather-related events; Interdisciplinary (psychology, social work, community \n', '18development, health promotion, emergency management) research on the effects of natural \nhazards on psychosocial health; and, Understanding of climate-resilient infrastructure that \nis protective of human health.\nŁ Vulnerable Populations:\n De˜nition of robust environmental health indicators of climate \nchange to monitor impacts on individuals and communities and develop adaptive measures; \nUnderstanding of how the nature of vulnerabilities to the health impacts of climate change \nfor˛speci˜c groups are changing in order to inform new protective measures for such \npopulations; Understanding how current perceptions and attitudes about climate change \nand health risks in˚uence the adoption of adaptations; and, Longitudinal studies across \ndifferent demographic groups (children, elderly, urban, rural and outdoor workers) to identify \nhealth impacts from slow developing hazards (e.g. drought) and cumulative effects of climate \nchange (e.g. extreme heat, drought and wild ˜res).\n', '193.0 SOCIETY, CULTURE AND BEHAVIOUR \nGlobal climate change impacts on human and natural systems are predicted to be severe and far \nreaching. The most physically and economically vulnerable will be affected disproportionately. \nAdaptation and mitigation are two strategies that society can employ to respond to these threats. \nImportantly, these approaches must take diversity in society, and cultural norms, practices and \npreferences into account to ensure uptake and success. Industry, commerce, and government \nplay indispensable roles in these actions but outcomes are ultimately dependent on individuals \nand receptivity to behavioural changes. Thus, the climate change discourse could be framed from \na health perspective to motivate behaviour change (55). There is however, little evidence on how \nto change behaviours that contribute to climate change (56). In considering the broader scienti˜c \ndiscourse on the determinants of behaviour and behavioural change, four themes stand out\n9. First, knowledge de˜cits are not the primary barrier to action; knowing about the causes \nand˛consequences of climate change does not, on its own, motivate people to change \ntheir˛lifestyles (57). Instead, it is emotionsŠthe feelings that accompany thinkingŠthat are \ncentral (58). Negative emotions, including fear, pessimism, and guilt, can produce passive \nand defensive responses, and do little to encourage individuals to change their behaviour and \nto press for wider social action. So-called ‚fear appeals™ only work if accompanied by equally \nstrong messages about how to address the problem (59). \nSecond, climate change is best represented in ways that anchor it in positive emotions (60), \nby˛framing action in ways that connect with people™s core values and identities.\n Examples \ninclude framing climate change as: an ethical and intergenerational issue; about safeguarding \nancestral lands and the sanctity of the natural world; or an appreciation of the global injustice \nof anthropogenic climate change driven by rich countries but paid for by poorer ones (61). \nAligning climate change to a range of ethical positions and a core set of identities can offer \na˛way of appealing to diverse social groups, and thus securing a broad and inclusive platform \nof public support for action. Avoiding the rhetoric of climate catastrophe could facilitate this, \nand emphasise, instead, human capacity to steer a course to a sustainable future, including \nlifting the burdens that unmitigated climate change would otherwise impose on future \ngenerations (62).Third, integral to such an ethical framing of climate change is the \nimplied duty on national \nand international organisations to take action. A recurrent \n˜nding is that the public sees the \nmain responsibility for action lying with governments and other powerful institutions, not \nleast because the options open to individuals to take radical action to cut their own GHG \nemissions are often sorely limited by cost or availability (e.g. poor public transport provision). \nPublic willingness to take action is also contingent on those considered responsible for \nclimate change, taking action themselves (63). Th e majority of the public in cross-national \nsurveys believe that their country has a responsibility to take action on climate change, \nand˛that their government is not doing enough. \n9 Excerpt from \nLancet Commission on Health and Climate Change: Policy responses to protect public health (2015).\n', '20Fourth, many climate-affecting \nbehaviours are habitual and resistant to change.\n Everyday domestic energy use (e.g. cooking, heating the home), travel behaviour, and eating patterns \nare undertaken as part of a daily routine and without conscious thought. Such behaviours are \nresistant to change, even if alternative options are available, and interventions relying on \nincreasing knowledge have limited effect (64).\nWhile adaptation is largely dependent on the availability of information relevant to climate \nchange, it appears that motivation for voluntary mitigation is mostly dependent on perceived \nsusceptibility to threats and severity of climate change or climate variability impacts.\nThe technological, ˜nancial, and behavioural changes needed to meet ambitious long-term \ngoals are in principle feasible. But they need to be accomplished in the face of highly \ndiverse˛social, cultural, economic, and political contexts. Opposing national (and vested) \ninterests, clashing views of what constitutes fair distribution of effort, and a model \nof˛economic growth that is currently tied to fossil fuel use, can make progress fraught. \nHulme (2011) outlines several key climate change issues that when framed as a health issue, \nrather than purely as an environmental, economic, or technological challenge, makes the need \nfor action that much clearer (65). Health puts a more personal and human face on what˛can \nsometimes seem to be a distant threat. By making the case for climate change as˛a health \nissue, it is hoped that the civilizational crisis we face will achieve greater public˛resonance. \nPublic concerns about the health effects of climate change, such as under-nutrition and food \ninsecurity, have the potential to accelerate political action in ways that attention to carbon \ndioxide emissions alone do not. \nThe scienti˜c literature relates a few avenues for public health engagement in the context \nof˛mitigation: the continued work towards establishing a framework for a strong, predictable, \nand international carbon pricing mechanisms; rapidly expanding access to renewable \nenergy in low-income and middle-income countries; ensuring adequate local capacity and \npolitical support to develop low-carbon healthy energy choices; adopting mechanisms \nto˛facilitate collaboration between Ministries of Health and other government departments \nand empowering health professionals; agreeing and implementing an international agreement \nwhich supports countries in transitioning to a low-carbon economy; and investing in climate \nchange and public health research. \n', '214.0 CLIMATE CHANGE, HEALTH \nAND˜AN˜INTEGRATED APPROACH \nAn integrated approach to addressing climate change and health related issues will require \ninnovative horizontal program development. Understanding and meeting the different needs \nand objectives of participating government departments, provincial partners and various \nstakeholders will be critical to effective and ongoing engagement. Grounding this approach \nin a climate change framework will require strategic engagement across ˜les that are normally \nstructured in a ‚silo™ or thematic way in order to enhance common understanding of the \nhorizontal nature of the health impacts of climate change. Programs can be designed by aligning \nwork across key activities, with strong integration of the science and policy. This will ensure \nbest use of limited resources to address the complex and layered issues presented by the health \neffects of climate change. \nWeaknesses in systems and infrastructures in various sectors are necessarily interconnected, \nwith a variety of anticipated and unanticipated knock on effects. Climate change is exacerbating \nalready vulnerable situations, which puts demands not only on the impacted region itself, \nbut also on external efforts to establish sustainable ways to reduce human health impacts. \nStark evidence of this can be seen in resource poor regions. The recent Ebola health crisis in \nWest˛Africa was an extreme example of a tipping point of multiple systems that already had little \nto no resilience. In Sierra Leone (the epicenter of the Ebola outbreak) climate change had already \nweakened that country™s vulnerable infrastructures and capacity (health, physical, agriculture, etc) \nwith unusually intense ﬁseasonal droughts, strong winds, thunderstorms, landslides, heat waves, \n˚oods, and changed rainfall patternsﬂ (66). This made all aspects of emergency response to the \nemerging disease situation that much more dif˜cult. Ultimately, the cost, both in human lives \nand ˜nancially, was very high. Globalization in all markets rapidly moves goods, people and \ninfectious diseases to new areas of the world. This is further complicated by the fact that novel \npathogens are emerging more rapidly, often from areas with high populations, poor sanitation \nand nutrition, and greater mobility than ever before. Overarching understanding and awareness \nof existing and future risk and trends in various sectors, and how they interact and support each \nother, will be critical to adaptive capacity globally. Proposed key areas for effective horizontal \nalignment in addressing climate change and health include:\nŁ Education and Awareness:\n Public communication and education initiatives to establish healthy behaviours and choices related to the impact of climate change on human health. \nŁ Surveillance and Monitoring: Using research data and analysis gathered from public health \nsurveillance systems to address health impacts related to climate change including identifying \ndisease trends and identifying vulnerable individuals and communities. \nŁ Building and Sustaining Healthy Environments:\n Playing a role in making infrastructure more \nresilient by informing and educating the public about health risks, advocating for changes \nthat promote and improve health, and encouraging the adoption of health-promoting \nchange in urban planning and community infrastructure. \nŁ Capacity Building: Building community resilience by increasing the capacity of individuals \nand communities to cope and adapt to current and anticipated changes in climate.\n ', '22Ł Research and Innovation:\n Research to increase knowledge and address gaps on potential \nclimate-related health risks and health resilience including how and which populations and \ncommunities are most vulnerable. \nŁ Emergency Planning:\n Advancing overall public health preparedness for climate impacts \nto enhance public health security related to health, critical public health services \nand˛infrastructure (e.g. enhanced monitoring and surveillance and risk management \nmeasures). \nŁ Leadership: Strengthening partnerships across Canada by engaging Provincial and \nTerritorial governments and key stakeholders to strengthen the national capacity to deal \nwith current and future impacts of climate change on public health\nŁ Integrating Adaptation and Sustainable Development into Federal Policy and Planning: Ensuring that climate change considerations are integrated into and across federal \nactivities, such as research, policy, and planning processes. These actions also serve to \nstrengthen accountability and transparency, providing greater public con˜dence that \ndecisions in the federal government are being made in full awareness of potential social, \nhealth, economic and environmental impacts. \n', '235.0 FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS\nIdenti˜ed as ﬁthe greatest health threat of the 21\nst centuryﬂ (8), the global impact of climate change is a key cross cutting issue of our time that has the potential to cause instability on \nan˛unprecedented scale. Adaptation measures \nare already required\n as the effects of climate \nchange are being experienced \ntoday. From a health-based perspective, a number of key \nelements should be considered to enhance our knowledge of the impacts of climate change \nand develop effective interventions. \nThere is a need for greater understanding of the leadership role that health has to play \nin˜changing the behaviour of Canadians leading to both effective adaptation and mitigation \nefforts while recognizing the importance of implementing health adaptations within the \nhealth systems and increasing the advocacy role of health professionals with their patients. \nIt˛is critical to recognize the powerful in˚uence that health considerations have to play in \nmitigation. A recent report by researchers at the International Monetary Fund identi˜es the \nomission of health impacts from polluting fuels as the largest of the subsidies provided to \nglobal energy production and use, which will total US$5.3 trillion in 2015 (67). This is larger \nthan total health spending by all the worlds™ governments. Therefore, the health implications \ncould and should be more effectively harnessed in efforts to build support for a stronger \nresponse to climate change. \nThere is a need for horizontal understanding and participation for effective interventions \nwith multiple co-bene˚ts. The built environment plays a vitally important role in promoting \nand maintaining health, so health considerations should be a key component of infrastructure \ndiscussions. A strong health-based vision would be city planning that encourages reduced \nair˛pollution and thus supports and promotes lifestyles that are healthy for the individual \nand˛for the planet. This is relevant to many interventions. For example air pollution, where \nencouraging a transition to cities that support and promote lifestyles that are healthy \nfor˛the individual and for the planet would have far-reaching impacts on chronic disease \nconditions (68). \nThere is a need to integrate health security considerations into upstream risk mitigation \nplans linked to health innovation, national security and climate change to as well as reinforce \nthe mechanisms and systems to manage health emergency preparedness and response. \nGiven recognised increases in the frequency and/or intensity of extreme weather events and \nemerging infectious disease outbreaks, this preparedness and foresight is critical.\nThere is a need to de˚ne cross-cutting adaptations that provide resiliency to both \noutbreaks of infectious disease, and the mounting burden of non-communicable disease.\n This can be achieved through the continued development of strong, ˚exible, and resilient \nhealth systems (69). Moving strategically ﬁupstreamﬂ in our common understanding of the \nsocial determinants of˛health can enable and enhance the health of Canadian populations \nwith considerations to health equity and patient-centered care. This provides a strategic \napproach to scaling up systematic strengthening of the health system through targeted public \nhealth and population health approaches.\n', '24There is a need to develop a long-term vision of health with considerations to the \nfundamental need for clean air and clean water to support the health of Canadian \ncommunities. These include the strategic management of biodiversity to both protect \nthe˛ecosystem services delivered in or natural environments, and in enhancing our One Health \nmanagement of infectious diseases. Adoption of mechanisms to facilitate collaboration between Ministries of Health and other government departments will empower health \nprofessionals and better integrate health and climate considerations in government-wide \nstrategies. This must acknowledge and seek to address the extent to which additional global \nenvironmental changes, such as deforestation, biodiversity loss, and ocean acidi˜cation, \nwill˛impact on human health and decrease resilience to climate change. Ecosystem-based \nadaptation utilises ecosystem services, biodiversity, and sustainable resource management \nas˛an adaptation strategy to enhance natural resilience and reduce vulnerability (70). These \ninterventions can be effective in reducing certain climate change vulnerability as they provide \ndisaster risk reduction functions and enable improvements in livelihoods and food security, \nespecially in poor and vulnerable settings. There is a need to enhance mechanisms to evaluate the effectiveness and ability \nof˜interventions in reducing the burden of high priority climate sensitive diseases and \nhealth conditions. Linkages between public health and climate change are complex \nand˛interact with other factors. It is important to be able to evaluate effectiveness through \nvarious outcome metrics including single interventions with multiple direct and indirect \noutcomes. While implementation of effective control interventions is the only way to reduce \nthe disease burden of climate change, evaluation of the effectiveness of public health \ninterventions is lacking. \nThe health and well-being of populations is necessarily dependant on the resilience, \nadaptability and strength of interacting systems across all sectors. This complex web of \ndependencies has become more acutely emphasised as the effects of a changing climate \nbecome more and more prominent in various dimensions. Actions to mitigate the \npotential˛enormity of these impacts have been relatively slow. Perhaps this is, in part, due \nto˛being stymied by the inherent complexity of how to proceed. However, many authors \nargue˛that most mitigation and adaptation responses to climate change are ﬁno-regretﬂ \noptions, which lead to direct reductions in the burden of ill-health, enhance community \nresilience, alleviate poverty, and address global inequity. \nEncouraging and supporting the integration of unique strengths and capacities from different \nsectors will address the challenges of complexity and move the agenda forward. Innovation \nand foresight in creating and leading these opportunities should de˜ne future considerations \nin governance and actions towards successful adaptations for mitigating health impacts of \nclimate change in Canada and globally. \n', '256.0 REFERENCES There is a large body of evidence summarizing the multiple impacts of climate change on \nhealth.
