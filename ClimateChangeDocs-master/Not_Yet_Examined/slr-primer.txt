We \nnow know that with climate change comes rising seas Œ and that this sea level rise will dramatically a˚ect \nCanada™s southern coastal communities.\n1 These communities  will require resilience and adaptive capacity \nto ensure their long-term sustainability. \nCoastal hazards associated with sea level rise include:\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Primer provides an introduction to past and future sea levels, an overview of four di˚erent \nadaptation \nstrategies\n, a recommended framework for decision making and ˜nally a total of 21 \nadaptation tools\n to \nsupport local adaptation action. \nThe B.C. Ministry of the Environment commissioned the preparation of this Sea Level Rise Adaptation \nPrimer for Canada™s Atlantic and Paci˜c coasts. Although this Primer was prepared in B.C., legislative \nprovisions, policies and local government applications discussed in this Primer include B.C., southern \nQuebec and the Atlantic coasts of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland \n and Labrador. Coastal communities along Hudson Bay and in the Arctic face a di˚erent set of vulnerabilities \nand were not considered within the context of this research.\nAdaptation strategies\n to sea level rise can be grouped as follows:\nProtect\n is a reactive strategy to protect people, property and infrastructure from sea level rise and is \ntypically the ˜rst response considered. Protecting the coastline through structural mechanisms such as \ndikes, seawalls and groynes has been the traditional approach to dealing with sea level rise in many parts \nof the world. With increasing sea level rise and coastal vulnerability, this strategy may be prohibitively \nexpensive and have limited long-term e˚ectiveness in highly vulnerable locations.\nAccommodate\n is an adaptive strategy that allows continued occupation of coastal areas while changes \nare made to human activities and/or infrastructure to adapt to sea level rise. Accommodation can also \n\ninvolve retro˜tting a building or making it more resilient to the consequences of sea level rise. Other \naccommodation measures may include liability reduction, such as a covenant indemnifying governments \nfrom the consequences of coastal hazards regardless of protection works undertaken.\n1 (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2007).\nProtect\nAccommodate\nRetreat\nAvoid\n', '4Retreat\n or Managed Retreat refers to any strategic decision to withdraw, relocate or abandon private or \npublic assets at risk due to sea level rise and associated coastal hazards. Retreat is an adaptive strategy to \nlimit the use of structural protection, discourage development in areas subject to sea level rise, and plan \n for the eventual relocation of buildings and infrastructure to areas with no risk or lesser risk.\nAvoid\n involves ensuring new development does not take place in areas subject to coastal hazards \nassociated with sea level rise or where the risk is low at present but will increase over time. This may involve \nidentifying future ﬁno buildﬂ areas within local government planning documents. A wide range of planning \ntools may be involved, leading to a decision to avoid development in areas subject to moderate to high \nrisk. An avoid strategy may involve land acquisition or the transfer of development potential to areas of \nlower risk.\nThese adaptation strategies are not mutually exclusive. Two or more strategies may be applied in di˚erent \ngeographic areas by the same local government. The most appropriate strategy for a geographic area may \nalso change over time. To implement these strategies, a wide range of adaptation tools are available.\nAdaptation tools \nincluded in this Primer should be considered in the context of information \ngathering, public education and community engagement, all crucial to informed decision-making \n\nprocesses within our democratic system.\nPlanning tools\n in this Primer include local government growth management objectives and \npolicies, mapping of potential coastal hazards, risk management and emergency preparedness.\nRegulatory tools\n include the regulation of subdivision, land use and buildings. These \nregulatory tools are generally prescribed by legislation and require the approval of a decision-\n\nmaker or ﬁgatekeeperﬂ responsible for the protection of the public interest.\nLand use change or restriction tools\n focus on the change or restriction of land \nuse other than through the regulatory functions noted above. Some of these tools are at \n\nthe disposal of local government and others may be undertaken by private landowners or \ncommunity groups in order to achieve local government goals.\nStructural tools\n consist of physical structures on land or in water to protect land and \nbuildings from coastal hazards. A wide range of hard protection and armouring ˜t in this \ncategory. \nNon-structural or soft armouring measures\n include the creation or restoration \nof wetlands, building sand dunes, or rehabilitation and beach nourishment. Both sand dunes \n\nand beaches are naturally occurring features, created by the interaction of wind, waves and \nsediment. They serve to dissipate the energy of storm surges and wave action. These natural \nfeatures can be mimicked or recreated to provide an adaptive bu˚er to sea level rise.\nSeveral of these tools are interdependent and should be used in combination. While structural and non-\n\nstructural adaptation tools may appear to represent polar opposites, combining them and creating hybrid \nshoreline protection systems may result in synergies and cumulative bene˜ts. As one example, living \nshorelines are hybrid protection systems that use coastal ecosystems to reduce erosion risk and optimize \nnatural shoreline functions.\nAn analysis of each adaptation tool is provided in this Primer. The analysis includes a description of the tool, \na discussion of implementation methods and an identi˜cation of the enabling legislation, where applicable. \nAdvantages and disadvantages of the tool are also examined using a ‚triple bottom line™ approach.\n', '5In addition to tools available to local governments, insurance and emergency management are also \nadaptation tools included in the Primer. Overland ˛ood insurance for residential development, while not \na tool available to the public or any level of government in Canada, is discussed as it plays a major role \nin all other G8 countries. Emergency management is a tool available to communities across Canada, but \nresponsibility for emergency management is shared with senior governments.\n\n\nmunicipal policies and bylaws in Atlantic Canada. The Primer concludes with both an annotated \nbibliography and a bibliography organized into four geographic areas: Canada, Quebec, U.S.A., \n and other international areas.\n', '6Acknowledgements\nThe Arlington Group would like to acknowledge and thank everyone who participated in the preparation of \nthis Primer, particularly Tina Neale, Adaptation Advisor, B.C.

One of the recognized impacts of climate change Œ and potentially the most dramatic \nfor the many coastal communities of Canada Œ is sea level rise (SLR).\n2As oceans warm, they expand, raising global sea levels. Melting ice caps, mountain glaciers, and land based \nice sheets (e.g. Antarctica and Greenland) also contribute to rising sea levels. In several areas on Canada™s \ncoast, geophysical factors, including subsidence and tectonic forces, also play a role. Coastal hazards \nassociated with sea level rise include coastal inundation, erosion, loss of intertidal habitat (‚coastal squeeze™) \nand loss of sea ice. Climate change also brings the prospect of more frequent and intense storms and ˛oods \nŒ particularly if storms occur during high tides.\n3 Observed Changes in Sea Level\nIn the latter part of the 19th century and during the 20th century, the global mean sea level rose at \n a rate of about 1.7 mm/year (17 cm/century).\n4 Since 1993, the rate of global sea level rise has increased \n to around 3 mm/year. \nThe red curve shows reconstructed sea levels from 1870 to 1950. The blue curve shows coastal tide gauge \nmeasurements from 1950, and the black curve is based on satellite altimetry. The upper and lower limits in \nthe curves show 90% con˜dence levels, which have narrowed over time due to the increasing accuracy of \ndata measurement techniques.\nStorm Surge and Wave Action\n2 (Ausenco Sandwell 2011)\n3 (National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy 2011)    \n4 (IPCC Fourth Assessment Report: Climate Change 2007)  \nFigure 1 - Global Trends in Mean Sea Level (IPCC, 2007)\n', '8Storm surge is one of the more common coastal hazards associated with sea level rise and a signi˜cant \ncontributor to coastal ˛ooding. A storm surge refers to a temporary increase in the height of the sea due to \nextreme meteorological conditions such as low atmospheric pressure and/or strong winds. A storm surge \nis independent of a high tide, but its impact may be magni˜ed during a high tide. In addition, sea level rise \naccentuates the risks from storm surge activity as higher water levels advance further inland and a˚ect \nareas of higher elevation. It is anticipated that climate change will cause more intense and frequent storms \nin the northern hemisphere and that sea level rise will increase the coastal areas at risk from these events.\n5 While a storm surge temporarily raises relative sea level, wave action is a more destructive force associated \n\nwith storms. Shoreline type and exposure to open water will determine wave intensity and frequency and \ntherefore the e˚ects of increased wave action and height on erosion and ˛ooding. In addition to relative \nsea level, waves are a˚ected by bathymetry of the near shore (i.e. o˚-shore depth and topography). \nIncreases in sea level may cause wave impacts to reach further inland or overtop defences that were \npreviously su˝cient, causing damage and ˛ooding. \nGlobal factors contributing to sea level rise include thermal expansion, melting of glaciers and ice caps, \nthe melting of the Greenland ice sheet and the melting of the Antarctic ice sheet. From 1961-2003, melting \nglaciers and ice caps contributed the most to the increase in sea level rise. From 1993 to 2003, the increased \nglobal rate was due mainly to thermal expansion.\nOn the B.C. coast, sea level rise has occurred in most locations but at a lower rate than the global average \nof 17 cm/century. Tectonic changes are a major factor on the B.C. coast, with structural uplift occurring on \nthe west coast of Vancouver Island and subduction occurring in the Strait of Georgia. Other regional factors \ninclude the subsidence of alluvial soils in the Fraser River estuary and postglacial rebound. Historic sea level \nrise changes along the B.C. coast include the following:\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n the increase was about 30 cm. This trend is exempli˜ed at the Fortress of Louisburg National Historic Site \n(Cape Breton, N.S.) where a 1740s ship™s mooring ring is located half a metre below today™s high tide level \n(see following photo).\n5 Stanton, Davis and Fencl 2010)\n6 Marine Environmental Data Service, Fisheries and Oceans Canada\n18th century mooring ring \n\nat Fortress of Louisbourg \n (Photo: Ambrose MacNeil)\n', '9In much of Atlantic Canada, sea level rise has exceeded the global increase due to the additional e˚ect of \nregional subsidence of the Earth™s crust. This subsidence is caused by the gradual collapse and migration \nof an area of uplift that developed around the margins of the North American ice sheets and by additional \nwater loading on the seabed of the Gulf of St. Lawrence as global mean sea levels have risen. This \nphenomenon is referred to as ﬁglacial isostatic adjustment.ﬂ\n7 In Nova Scotia, subsidence is estimated to be up \nto 20 cm/century.\n8 In Halifax, approximately half of the relative sea level rise is due to global mean sea level \nrise, with the remaining half due to regional subsidence. \nOn the other hand, the north shore of the Gulf of St. Lawrence in Quebec and Labrador is rebounding. Based \non long-term harbour records, the following sea level rise trends have been documented:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProjected Increases in Sea Level\nHow will sea level change in the future? \nHow much sea level rise will occur is subject to uncertainty Œ and the longer the time frame, the greater the \ndegree of uncertainty. \nIn its Fourth Assessment Report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projected global sea \nlevel rise using six di˚erent scenarios of future greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Variables used to determine \nGHG emissions included population projections, economic growth and the use of technology. \nDepending on the IPCC scenario used, the estimated rise in global sea level to the end of this century (i.e. \n2100) varies from 18 to 59 cm. Based on the large body of research which has taken place since the IPCC \nscenarios were prepared in 2007, these projections may be quite conservative. Recent scienti˜c research \nbased on empirical relationships between atmospheric carbon concentrations and sea levels in the \npaleoclimatological record suggests that the upper bounds of physically plausible sea level rise is larger \n than once thought, owing to thermal expansion and glacial and ice sheet melt. These ﬁsemi-empiricalﬂ \n studies generally project a sea level rise of between 0.47 m and 1.9 m by the year 2100.\n9  Both B.C. and Atlantic Canada recommend planning for sea level rise of approximately 1.0 m by the year 2100. \n\nA 2011 study for the Government of B.C. recommended sea level rise planning levels of 0.5 metres (50 cm) to \nthe year 2050, 1.0 metre to the year 2100 and 2.0 metres to the year 2200.\n10 This is higher than the 2007 IPCC \nscenarios but is consistent with sea level rise projections used for planning purposes in Europe and the U.S.A.\nEven if drastic measures are undertaken to slow down or even stop carbon emissions, sea levels will \ncontinue to rise for many centuries after global temperatures stabilize: a reality which has signi˜cant \nimplications for local government planning.\n11 Planning for sea level rise presents a challenge for local \n\nexample, the ˜rst local government to be incorporated in B.C. was New Westminster in 1859 and the oldest \ncontinuously occupied building in the province is less than 170 years old. \n7 (CBCL Limited 2009)\n8 (CBCL Limited 2009)\n9 (IPCC 2012) \n10 (Ausenco Sandwell 2011)  \n11 (Ausenco Sandwell 2011) \n', '10Most buildings and infrastructure have a lifespan much longer than the 20-30 year future time period \noften used when designing infrastructure and planning communities. Planning for a century of change is \na challenge, but is a realistic goal given the implications of projected sea level rise. Figure 2 (below) shows \nthe e˚ect of incremental increases in minimum building elevation planning over time, based on a 100 year \nlifespan for a structure.\nRegardless of the time frame used, observations and predictions of sea level rise will need to be periodically \nre-evaluated. Predictions of sea level rise will continue to evolve and be re˜ned as the science progresses \nand more data becomes available.\nVulnerability and Adaptation\nThe impact of sea level rise on Canada™s coastal zones depends largely on the vulnerability of coastal \ncommunities.  A community™s vulnerability is a function of its exposure and sensitivity to a hazard or \nenvironmental change and its adaptive capacity or resilience. Adaptive capacity is a function of local context \nand refers to a community™s ability to adapt to potential impacts, as well as cope with speci˜c events, based \non its social, economic and institutional resources.\n12 Vulnerability can therefore be lowered by adaptation \nmeasures which reduce exposure to (or risk from) a hazard or by increasing resilience.\n13 Some of Canada™s greatest vulnerabilities to climate change lie in coastal areas, which are home to \nconcentrated populations, economic centres and valuable ecosystems.\n14 Although Canada has a vast \ncoastline, the inhabited coastal area represents only 2.6% of the total land area. In 2001, 38.3% of the \nCanadian population lived within 20 kilometres (km) of a marine or Great Lakes shoreline. Of this total, \napproximately 4.9 million people, or 23%, lived on the Paci˜c coast, and 20% lived on the Atlantic coast.\n15 By 2015, it is estimated that a majority of Canadians (50.7%) will be living within 20˙km of the coast or the \n\nGreat Lakes, with the greatest concentration of people living within 5˙km of a shoreline.\n16A proactive approach to sea level rise adaptation is more cost e˚ective and less disruptive than a reactive \n\napproach. Adaptation should ideally aim to create resilient communities through a triple bottom line \n\n 12 (Barron, et al. 2012)\n13 (Mason 2005)\n14 (Stanton, Davis and Fencl 2010)\n15 (Mason 2005)\n16 (Mason 2005)\nDataStructure Lifespan\n1mAllowance for\nSea Level Rise\nYear of Building Construction\nSea level change\n\nrelative to 2000 (m)\n54321\n019001950200020502100Year\n2150220022502300HighMedianLow\nProjections1m100 years\n100 years\nFigure 2 - Sea level rise allowance for structure lifespan \n(Ausenco Sandwell, 2011)\n', '11\ne˝cient way from areas that cannot be protected in a cost-e˚ective manner.\n17 Adaptation is more than \nthe simple implementation of a suitable practice or technology. Sea level rise is a progressive and dynamic \nprocess and continuous adaptation is required. Adaptation should be viewed by community decision \nmakers as an ongoing process whereby risks and opportunities are prioritized, risk reduction measures are \nimplemented and their e˚ectiveness is tracked and assessed.\nCoastal Sensitivity\nNatural Resources Canada has mapped the sensitivity of Canada™s coastlines to a rise in sea level. \nSensitivity here means the degree to which a coastline may experience physical changes such as \n˛ooding, erosion, beach migration and coastal dune destabilization. The sensitivity index is a product \nof seven variables: relief (topography), geology, coastal landform, sea level tendency, shoreline \ndisplacement, tidal range and wave height. \nApproximately 7,000 kilometres of coastline are considered sensitive to sea level rise.\n18 Most of the British \nColumbia coast has a low sensitivity, mainly due to relief, geology and coastal landforms. However, \nthe areas at greatest risk are home to signi˜cant concentrations of population, built infrastructure and \neconomic activity. Major areas of Atlantic Canada (in particular the coasts of Nova Scotia, Prince Edward \nIsland and New Brunswick) are considered to have a high sensitivity to sea level rise. In addition, small \n areas of high sensitivity occur locally in B.C., Quebec, and Newfoundland and Labrador.\n17 (Hallegate 2011)  \n18 (Natural Resources Canada 2007)\nFigure 3 - Coastal sensitivity to sea level rise Œ Natural Resources Canada\nArctic Ocean\nBeaufort SeaHudson BayAtlantic OceanAlaskaGreenlandU.S.A.Sensitivity Index\n0-4.9 Low\n5-14.9 Moderate\n15 High', 'Primer Focus Area\n', '13Primer Focus Area\nThis Primer focuses on adaptation tools for Canada™s southern coasts, namely the provinces of British \nColumbia, Quebec, and the Atlantic Provinces of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and \nNewfoundland and Labrador. At 243,000 kilometres, Canada™s shoreline is the longest in the world.\n19 Although \nlargely undeveloped, coastal areas contain many of Canada™s major population and economic centres. \nBritish Columbia\nPOPULATION 4,400,057 (2011 CENSUS)\nThe B.C. coastline has a total length of approximately 29,000˙km,\n20 including the mainland and all islands from Haida Gwaii south to Vancouver Island and the Gulf Islands. Although dominated by rocky high-relief \nshores, the B.C. coast also has numerous long, twisting, deep ˆords and some wide sand beaches. Over 80% \nof the population of B.C. lives within 5˙km of the coast.\n21 In the Lower Mainland, where the majority of the population resides, there are many areas close to sea \n\nlevel which are vulnerable to the potential e˚ects of sea level rise. In most cases these areas are currently \nprotected by structural features such as dikes. Areas currently protected by dikes include the City of \nRichmond, Ladner and waterfront areas in New Westminster, Port Moody and White Rock as well as all Delta \n\nand Surrey farmland. Waterfront areas in Vancouver Œ including Stanley Park, Southlands, False Creek, West \nand North Vancouver and the Vancouver International Airport are also protected by dikes. In addition, most \nMusqueam, Tsawwassen, Semiahmoo, Tsleil Waututh and Squamish First Nations lands, all in the Lower \nMainland, are close to sea level. Over 4,600 hectares of farmland and over 15,000 hectares of industrial and \nurban residential areas in the Lower Mainland are located within 1 metre of sea level.\n22 On Vancouver Island, \nalmost all communities have ocean exposure and many have vulnerable coastlines or low-lying areas. \nAlong the northern coast of B.C., critical infrastructure in the Port of Prince Rupert is close to sea level, as \n are most settlements on Haida Gwaii. \nIn all, some 59 of 161 municipalities and 14 of 29 regional districts in B.C. consist of coastal communities \nor have some direct coastline exposure. British Columbia™s \nLocal Government Act\n allows local governments \nto manage land use in coastal areas using a range of tools including o˝cial community plans and \nzoning bylaws. Flood Hazard Area Land Use Management Guidelines released by the province in 2004 \nrecommend a minimum Flood Construction Level of 1.5 m above the natural boundary of the sea and \na minimum building setback distance from the sea of 15 m. While local governments are required to \nconsider these guidelines when establishing ˛oodplain bylaws, the manner in which the guidelines are \napplied varies by municipality. \nA 2011 study commissioned by the B.C. government\n23 recommended sea level rise planning levels of \n0.5˙metres (50 cm) to the year 2050, 1.0 metres to the year 2100 and 2.0 metres to the year 2200 (see Figure˙2) \nplus adjustments for local rates of vertical land movement (uplift or subsidence). Sea level rise will not take \nplace uniformly along the B.C. coast. Variations will occur due to the settlement of alluvial soils, aquifer \nreduction caused by fresh water removal, and tectonic change as the Juan de Fuca plate subducts beneath \nthe North American plate. In addition, because of land subsidence in the Fraser River delta, relative sea level \nwill increase by an additional 1Œ2 mm per year, primarily a˚ecting Richmond, Delta, Queensborough and \nthe New Westminster Quay. Post-glacial rebound and tectonic uplift partially mitigate global sea level rise \n19 (Natural Resources Canada 2007)\n20 (Marine Planning O˝ce, Province of B.C. n.d.)\n21 (Mason 2005)\n22 (Ausenco Sandwell 2011)\n23 (Ausenco Sandwell 2011)\n', '14in some locations\n24 of B.C. such as on the west coast of Vancouver Island. In the most sensitive areas, much \nof today™s coastal wetlands, barrier beaches and lagoons will be underwater, and coastal structures will \nbecome increasingly vulnerable to ˛ood damage. \nQuebec\nPOPULATION 7,903,001 (2011 CENSUS)\nThe coastal region of Quebec stretches northeast of Quebec City and around the Gulf of St. Lawrence \nfor 3,500˙km. The Gulf of Saint Lawrence is the world™s largest estuary covering an area of about 236,000 \nsquare kilometres. The Gulf begins in Quebec as the outlet for the Great Lakes which travel along the Saint \nLawrence River on their way to the Atlantic Ocean. The north coast (Côte Nord region) has 1,825˙km of \n\ncoastline. Just over a third of this coastline is comprised of primarily rocky cli˚s, 38% is rocky cli˚s with \nshallow beach, lagoon or estuary covering over the rock substratum and the remainder of the coastline \nconsists of beaches, lagoons or estuaries. The south coast and islands (Bas-Saint-Laurent and Gaspésie-Iles-\nde-la-Madeleine regions), are comprised of 1500˙km of coastline. Approximately half of the coastline for la \nGaspésie consists of rocky cli˚ escarpments, soft clay cli˚s, sandy beaches and marshes.\n25 Over two thirds of \nthe Magdalen Islands (Îles-de-la-Madeleine) coastline is sandy beaches, and the rest are soft clay cli˚s and \nlagoons. It is estimated that 40% of the Bas-Saint-Laurent coastline is comprised of sandy beaches and the \nrest consists of marshes, rocky cli˚s and clay cli˚s.\n26The province of Quebec consists of 17 administrative regions under provincial jurisdiction of which the \n\nregions of Côte-Nord, Bas-Saint-Laurent, and Gaspésie-Iles-de-la-Madeleine have coastlines exposed to \nthe e˚ects of sea level rise. Within these regions are 121 municipalities, home to a population of over \n400,000 people. Most of the 121 municipalities along the coastal areas apply a 10Œ15 metre setback for the \nprotection of the shorelines. This was established in 1987 by provincial policy. Some municipalities have \nadopted more stringent regulations based on detailed research on local erosion rates and corresponding \ngovernment recommendations. \nNot all coastal areas of Quebec have been or will continue to experience sea level rise in the same way. \nSome areas, such as Sandy Hook in Havre-Aubert on the Magdalen Islands, are in fact increasing their \ncoastal reach into the sea through natural processes of erosion and sediment transport. Other communities \nare extending their coastal land area through dredging. Dramatic erosion during storm events is a˚ecting \n\n\n(Baie-des-Chaleurs) on the east point of the Gaspésie region.\n27 24 (APEG Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of BC 2012)\n25 (L™erosion littorale en Gaspesie COMPRENDRE - GERER - AGIR 2010)\n26 (Juneau, Bachand and Lelievre 2012)\n27 (Morneau 2012)\n', '15Figure 4 - Quebec Administrative Regions\n (Source: Banque d™images en Univers Social)\nAtlantic Canada\nMore than 2.3 million people live in the Atlantic region, most of them in urban areas and smaller \ncommunities along the coastline.\n28 In 2001 it was estimated that over 60% of the population on the \n Atlantic Coast (including Quebec) lived within 5˙km or less of the shoreline.\n29 The largest region of high sensitivity to sea level rise is in Atlantic Canada and includes large parts of the \n\ncoasts of Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick.\n30 In the Atlantic region, unlike other parts \nof Canada, the predicted e˚ects of climate change, such as sea level rise and the increased occurrence \nand intensity of extreme weather events, are compounded in many coastal areas by post-glacial crustal \nsubsidence. This increases coastal erosion and ˛ooding, placing dikelands, coastal populations and their \ninfrastructure and industries at risk.\n31All four provinces have assumed a sea level rise of approximately one metre by the year 2100. This takes \ninto consideration a component for the sinking or rising of the earth™s crust as the result of a rebound \ne˚ect from the last ice age, including consideration of vertical land movement. There is considerable \nconsistency in the analysis and documentation of issues amongst the four provinces. Nevertheless, the \nlegal and policy framework for dealing with coastal zone planning and development varies for each \nAtlantic province. Newfoundland and Labrador is the only Atlantic jurisdiction which has set a province \n\nset for a 1:100 year return period. The other Atlantic Provinces rely on the generally accepted coastal \n\nengineering design standards for the life of structures in coastal areas, which is assumed to be 50 years. \nOne major exception to this standard is the Confederation Bridge between New Brunswick and Prince \nEdward Island, which was built one metre higher to account for \n sea level rise over the 100 year design life of the project.\n28 (Environment Canada 2012)\n29 (Mason 2005)\n30 (Shaw, et al. 1998)\n31 (The Sustainable Planning Branch, New Brunswick Department of Environment and Local Government 2002)\nLes régions administratives du Québec\nRégion de Montréal10130601 Bas-Sain-Laurent02 Saquenay-Lac-Saint-Jean03 Capitale-Nationale04 Mauricie\n05 Estrie06 Montréal07 Outaouais08 Abitibi-Témiscaingue09 Côte-Nord10 Nord-du-Québec\n11 Gaspésie-Îles-de-la-Madelaine\n12 Chaudières-Appalaches13 Laval\n14 Lanaudière15 Laurentides16 Montérégie\n17 Centre-du-Québec0902110108040312051617141507', '16New Brunswick\nPOPULATION 751,171 (2011 CENSUS)\nThe province of New Brunswick has approximately 5,500˙km of salt-water coastline, which extends from \nthe Gaspé Region to the Nova Scotia border and along the Bay of Fundy from The Saint Croix River to the \nNova Scotia border. There is great diversity in the coastline from the rugged and grassy dunes along the \nAcadian Peninsula and Chaleur Bay to the sandy shores of the Northumberland Strait and the rocky cli˚s \n\nof the Bay of Fundy.\n32Nearly 60% of the population lives within 50 kilometres of the coast and there has been signi˜cant pressure \n\nfor coastal development in recent years. Between 1990 and 1999, 6,268 new coastal lots were created Œ an \naverage of 627 new coastal properties per year.\n33 A total of 8 provincial counties and 50 municipal areas \nwithin them have coastline or areas exposed to the e˚ects of sea level rise. The Gulf of St. Lawrence coast of \n\nNew Brunswick is considered to have the highest sensitivity to sea level rise and associated storm impacts.\n34The New Brunswick Department of Environment and Local Government produced a Coastal Areas \nProtection Policy for New Brunswick in 2002. The New Brunswick coastal policy is enforced via existing \nprovincial legislation such as environmental impact assessment requirements or watercourse alteration \napprovals. These provincial requirements also apply within municipalities, and some municipalities have \nincorporated either elements of or the entire coastal zone policy directly into their bylaws.\nEstimates of global sea level rise in conjunction with the best estimates of local vertical motion have \nbeen used to predict 0.9 to 1.05 metres of total sea level rise over the next century for the coastlines \n of New Brunswick.\n3532 (The Sustainable Planning Branch, New Brunswick Department of Environment and Local Government 2002)\n33 Ibid\n34 (Daigle 2012)35 Ibid\nLameque, N.B. \n(Photo \nfrom New Brunswick \nCoastal Areas \nProtection Policy)\n', '17Nova Scotia\nPOPULATION 921,727 (2011 CENSUS)\nThe province of Nova Scotia has 13,300˙km of jagged coastline that includes some 3,800 coastal \n islands, bays and estuaries.\n36 Development in Nova Scotia tends to be clustered with a high intensity \n of residences along the coast. The Province of Nova Scotia estimates 70% of the province™s population \nlives on or near the coastline.\n37 Much of Nova Scotia is considered highly sensitive to sea level rise and has been experiencing extensive \nconstruction and creation of parcels in scenic coastal locations Œ many of which will be in hazard zones in \na few decades.\n38 The south coast and eastern shores of Nova Scotia have been shown to have signi˜cant \nsensitivity to sea level rise and associated storm impacts.\nThe Province of Nova Scotia includes 55 municipalities, three regional municipalities, 21 rural municipalities \nand 31 towns Œ the majority of which are on the coast or in areas potentially subject to coastal hazards \nassociated with sea level rise. The Province has delegated land-use, or zoning powers, to the municipalities \n\nthrough the \nMunicipal Government Act\n and the Halifax Regional Municipality Charter\n. These powers allow \nmunicipalities to develop planning strategies and bylaws to regulate land use. In spite of this, only about \n45% of provincial land has comprehensive municipal plans or land-use bylaws in place.\n39 Development on \nthe shoreline continues with no bu˚ers mandated except for a few designated protected beaches. \nNova Scotia has in place a Coastal Management Framework, which provides a foundation for governments \nand citizens to work together to ensure the sustainable use and protection of coastal areas and resources. \nThe provincial priority coastal issues include coastal development, coastal access, sea level rise and storm \n\nevents, working waterfronts, coastal water quality, and coastal ecosystems and habitats. This Framework \nprovides an outline of how the province plans to move forward in protecting and maintaining its valuable \ncoastal resources.\nIn 2002, the Province of Nova Scotia created a Provincial Oceans Network, which is comprised of \nrepresentatives from provincial departments and agencies with responsibilities and interests in coastal \n\nNetwork serves two core functions: 1) to provide advice and expertise in implementation of the Coastal \nManagement Framework, and 2) to facilitate coordination on coastal and ocean management issues and \ninitiatives within the provincial government.\n40 The Government of Nova Scotia has made coastal management a priority with the release of its State of \n\nNova Scotia™s Coast Report. This Report provides baseline information on the province™s coastal areas and \nresources which will be used to develop a Coastal Strategy. A draft of the Coastal Strategy was released in \n2012 and one of the key objectives is that buildings and infrastructure be located, built and maintained \n \nin a manner that minimizes impacts from rising sea levels and storms.\nPresent rates of relative sea level rise di˚er all over Nova Scotia due to varying rates of vertical land \nmovement across the province.

The coastline is deeply \nindented by tidal inlets, estuaries and salt marsh and generally alternates between headlands of steep \nsandstone blu˚s and extensive sandy beaches. The north shore of the Island, facing the Gulf of St Lawrence, \nfeatures extensive sand-dune formations.\n42 The coast of P.E.I. has been identi˜ed as one of the areas most \nsensitive to sea level rise in the entire country. Factors contributing to this sensitivity include soft sandstone \nbedrock, a sandy and dynamic shore zone which is sediment starved in places, low terrain behind the shore \nwith signi˜cant ˛ooding potential and documented high rates of shoreline retreat.\n43Given P.E.I.™s size and shape Œ the island is only 224˙km long and between 6˙km and 64˙km wide Œ a \n\nsigni˜cant proportion of the population lives on or near the coast.\nParts of the North Shore of P.E.I. are rated highly sensitive because this coast is exposed to the open Gulf \nof St. Lawrence, with potential wave-generating fetches\n44 of several hundred kilometres. Decreased sea-\nice cover in winter may increase the amount of open water fetch, creating larger waves superimposed on \n\nstorm surges.\n45 Although Charlottetown Harbour is largely protected from the Northumberland Strait and \nthe Gulf of St. Lawrence, relative sea level is rising and storm-surge events are increasingly common. \nThe provincial government has a major role in land use planning in P.E.I., managing about 90% of the land \narea in the province. The 31 municipal governments, which practise comprehensive land use planning, \nhave jurisdiction over the remaining 10% of the province™s land area. For the most part, municipal land use \nplans are more restrictive than provincial ones, although in the case of coastal area development, some \nmunicipalities are actually less restrictive than provided for in provincial legislation. \nRelative sea level estimates for northwest and southwest P.E.I. to year 2100 anticipate a rise of 1.0 to 1.08 m \n± 0.48 m.

The northern coastal region \nof Labrador is ruggedly mountainous with deep ˆords and few settlements. The southern coastal region \nof Labrador has a rugged barren foreshore and light to moderate settlement. In Newfoundland, the \nwest coast is well-forested coastal plains with several ˆord-like bays, the largest of which are the Bay of \nIslands and Bonne Bay. There are almost continuous settlements in the bays and coves along this coast. \nThe northeast coast, with its numerous bays, islands and headlands fronts on the Atlantic Ocean from \nthe Great Northern Peninsula to the Avalon Peninsula.

In many areas of the province, the presence of relatively steep-sloping bedrock-exposed \ncoastlines means sea level rise will have little impact. Notable exceptions to this include the northwest \ncoast of the Burin Peninsula and St. George™s Bay as well as speci˜c communities such as Placentia.\n52 With \nongoing relative sea level rise, storm surge activity is likely to have a progressively stronger impact on \nhigher areas of the shoreline. Areas at greatest risk are sand dominated beaches, coastal dune complexes, \ntidal ˛ats, estuaries and salt marshes.\n53 In the Northern Strategic Plan released in 2007, the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador \n\nrecognized the need for a targeted action plan to address climate change in Northern Labrador. In the 2011\n Climate Change Action Plan\n ﬁCharting Our Courseﬂ, the provincial government committed to preparing a \ndedicated strategy on climate change adaptation for Northern Labrador.\n54 The plan highlights a number \nof climate change adaptation strategies for the province including integrating adaptation considerations \ninto public and private sector decision-making, and considering climate change implications in the site \nselection and design of provincial government buildings and infrastructure. \nIn June of 2011, the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador released a Coastal and Oceans \nManagement Strategy and Policy Framework for public discussion. The need for a provincial coastal \nland use plan was stated, taking into account the principles of sustainable development, climate change \nadaptation, hazard prediction and preparedness, and economic development.\n55 This document identi˜es \nthat to be proactive in addressing coastal and ocean issues, the Government of Newfoundland and \nLabrador must take a leadership role and engage in meaningful integrated coastal and ocean management \nprocesses. A key existing provision noted in the document is to maintain a 15 metre shoreline reservation \nor bu˚er between the shoreline and the boundary of current land titles issued by the Department of \nEnvironment and Conservation. \nAvailable data on recent sea level change indicates relative sea level is currently rising across much of \nthe Island of Newfoundland, is stable or rising in northern Newfoundland and southern Labrador, and is \nfalling in much of central and northern Labrador. For the east coast of Labrador, sea level is estimated to \nrise by 0.80 m to the year 2099. However, for those areas with the greatest concentration of the provincial \npopulation, the Avalon Peninsula and the west coast, a potential sea level rise of 0.80 to 1.0+ m by 2099 \nis anticipated.\n5650 (Government of Newfoundland and Labrador n.d.)\n51 (Catto 2010)\n52 (Batterson and Liverman 2010)\n53 (Catto 2010)\n54 Northern Labrador includes the Nunatsiavut Government, a 72,500˙km\n2 area where limited self-rule was established for the Labrador \nInnu following a 2005 treaty between the Labrador Inuit Association, the Government of Canada, and the Government of Newfoundland \nand Labrador.\n55\n56 (Batterson and Liverman 2010)\n', 'Framework for Decision-Making\n', '21Framework for Decision-Making\nCommunities need adaptation \nstrategies\n and tools\n to minimize the long-term economic, environmental \nand social impacts of sea level rise on development in coastal areas. \nAdaptation strategies\n can be grouped into four broad categories:\n57Protect\n is a reactive strategy to protect people, property and infrastructure from sea level rise and is \ntypically the ˜rst response considered. Protecting the coastline through structural mechanisms such as \ndikes,\n58 seawalls and groynes has been the traditional approach to dealing with sea level rise in many parts \nof the world.\n59 Such measures range from large-scale public projects to small-scale e˚orts by individual \nproperty owners. Protection strategies tend to be expensive and may have limited long-term e˚ectiveness \n\nin highly vulnerable locations.\n60 A protect strategy alone creates an expectation that coastal defences will be maintained in perpetuity, which \nmay lead to a false sense of security. It may also compound risk by encouraging further development behind \ndikes and other structural protection elements, thereby increasing the number of people and amount of \nproperty at risk if these fail. Protection strategies are especially attractive if the costs of protection are borne \n\nby governments at di˚erent levels (i.e., if individual property owners bear little or no risk) and if land use is not \nmanaged with a long term perspective by local governments. \nCommunities may use a protect strategy as an interim measure, providing time to implement a retreat \n\n\nencourage further development.\nOther forms of protection can take place. There is growing recognition of the bene˜ts of non-structural (soft \narmouring) protection measures, including beach nourishment and coastal wetland restoration and creation. \nThese measures can be implemented as sea levels rise, and may complement or supplement structural \n\nprotection. Such non-structural adaptations can enhance the natural resilience of the coastal zone and can be \nless expensive than structural protection, which can lead to unwanted e˚ects on erosion and sedimentation \npatterns if not properly implemented.\n61Accommodate\n is an adaptive strategy that allows continued occupation of coastal areas while changes are \nmade to human activities and/or infrastructure to adapt to sea level rise. Accommodation can also involve \nretro˜tting a building or making it more resilient to the consequences of sea level rise. Accommodation \nmeasures for new construction include the use of structural ˜ll to raise the elevation of habitable space, \nrestricting building areas subject to ˛ooding to garages, crawl space or other nonhabitable uses, and \nincreasing setbacks from watercourses. Strategies such as covenants indemnifying governments from the \nconsequences of coastal hazards may also be used to reduce local government liability. \nRetreat\n (or Managed Retreat\n) refers to any strategic decision to withdraw, relocate or abandon private \nor public assets at risk due to coastal hazards. Retreat is an adaptive strategy designed to limit the use of \n\nstructural protections, discourage development in areas subject to sea level rise, and plan for the eventual \nrelocation of buildings and infrastructure to areas with no risk or a lesser risk. Communities in Prince \nEdward Island have applied this strategy where storms have resulted in signi˜cant shoreline loss. \n57 Note: Although these strategies are commonly used, there is considerable variation in their organization and description. Other \napproaches include Preserve, Business as Usual and Attack (based on Land Reclamation).\n58 The spelling of dike and dyke (also dikeland and dykeland) are both commonly used in Canada. The term dike is preferred by the \n\nGovernment of B.C. and has been used throughout this report except where the spelling of dyke is contained in a legislative reference \n \nor publication.\n59 (Adaptation Œ Coastal Zone 2007)\n60 (Adaptation Œ Coastal Zone 2007)\n61 (Adaptation Œ Coastal Zone 2007)\n', '22Managed retreat is a strategy typically undertaken with a long-term perspective. Small scale managed \nretreat may include site-speci˜c relocation within a property or relocation to another site. Large scale \nrelocation may include an entire community. As part of a managed retreat strategy, homes, lighthouses, \nroads and even barns have been moved further inland to protect them from erosion and storm surge. The \nstrategy is often used when property owners have enough room on their parcel or when the ongoing costs \nof storm repairs and safety concerns outweigh the costs of retreating. The strategy may also be used to \nprovide space for coastal ecosystems to expand or reclaim areas as the sea level rises.\n62 Managed retreat is not currently used as frequently as other strategies. There is often a threshold (e.g. \nnumber of coastal residents or value of properties at risk) above which retreat becomes less likely. Retreat \nfrom urbanized areas is theoretically possible but politically di˝cult, and there are few (if any) examples \nof successful and peaceful retreat in densely populated areas. However, it is anticipated that the use of \n\nmanaged retreat will increase in the future as the rate of sea level rise increases or the cost of a protect \n or accommodate strategy becomes excessive.\nAvoid\n involves planning so that development does not take place in areas subject to coastal hazards \nassociated with sea level rise or where the risk is low at present but will increase over time. This may \n\ninvolve identifying future ﬁno buildﬂ areas within local government planning documents. A wide range of \nplanning tools may be involved in coming to a decision to avoid development in areas subject to moderate \nto high risk. Regulatory tools may include the designation or zoning of lands for limited development or \nnonhabitable uses. An avoid strategy may include land acquisition or restriction tools such as a land trust, \nor the transfer of development potential to areas with low or no risk due to sea level rise.\nBusiness as Usual\n is not speci˜cally included as a strategy in this Primer but it can be considered as a \ncomposite of existing strategies. All four adaptation strategies are currently applied to varying degrees \nin di˚erent local government jurisdictions throughout coastal Canada. It would be inappropriate to call \nﬁbusiness as usualﬂ a ﬁdo nothingﬂ strategy as there is widespread recognition of coastal risks and the \napplication of various tools to address risk. However, the consequences of ﬁbusiness as usualﬂ are not \n\nneutral as sea level rise will lead to increased vulnerability or require the use of new tools, a di˚erent mix \nof tools and higher expenditures. If nothing is done, the consequences of Business as Usual will mean the \nacceptance of additional risk, whether by intention, omission or lack of resources.\nAn attack strategy refers to options that reclaim land from the sea through dredging, diking, etc. These \nare also referred to as land reclamation, land claim, or ﬁadvance the line.ﬂ This strategy has seen some \napplication in other jurisdictions, particularly in the Netherlands, Hong Kong and Singapore. All these \nlocations have small physical coastal land areas and some of the highest population densities in the world. \nIn these jurisdictions, some low-lying land has been diked and/or ˜lled to accommodate agriculture, \nport and airport development, and for residential purposes. In the Dutch case, the current use of ocean \nsediment dredged from one location to another represents a form of soft armouring to protect vulnerable \nareas behind dikes.\nAn attack strategy refers to measures that reclaim land from the sea through dredging, diking and ˜ll. This \nstrategy is also referred to as land reclamation, or ﬁadvancing the lineﬂ and has seen some application in \nother jurisdictions, particularly in the Netherlands, Hong Kong and Singapore. An attack strategy is not \nconsidered a viable response to sea level rise in Canada. The economic and environmental costs of land \n\nreclamation, wherever implemented, are extremely high. Instances of land reclamation in Canada take the \nform of soft armouring or hard protection implemented as part of a protect strategy.\n63 62 (Abel, et al. 2011)\n63 Local in˜lling to create or enhance harbours and farmland has historically occurred in Atlantic Canada and in the Lower Mainland of \nBritish Columbia but is considered to have minimal applicability for the future due to prohibitive costs and environmental impacts.\n', '23Sea Level Rise Adaptation Process\nDeveloping and implementing sea level rise adaptation measures at a local level does not begin with the \nimplementation of an adaptation tool. Prior to the implementation of any of the adaptation tools discussed \nin this Primer, a process of information gathering, public education and community engagement should be \nundertaken by local community decision makers.\n64 Through a process of information gathering, including risk and vulnerability assessment, local governments \n\nwill be able to identify their resource limitations and any knowledge gaps. This process may involve building \ninternal capacity, identifying champions and establishing a cross-departmental steering committee to \naddress sea level rise. After su˝cient baseline information has been gathered, public education and \n\ncommunity engagement should begin. The inclusion of community input at this early stage can help \n foster a sense of ownership and provide valuable information that may otherwise be overlooked. While \n public education and community engagement are shown in Figure 5 as one part of the process, in practice \nthey should be included throughout the adaptation process. Establishing community priorities and a \npreferred strategic direction will help narrow down the choice of adaptation tools that may be applicable \n in individual communities. \nMany of the adaptation tools identi˜ed in this Primer will require ongoing public input and support to \nbe successfully implemented. As the science of estimating sea level rise and its e˚ects evolves, so too will \nadaptation. In order to incorporate new data into the adaptation process and assess the e˚ectiveness of \nadaptations tools already implemented, monitoring and evaluation are required to feed back into the process.\nThe following provides a brief introduction and some examples of information gathering and engagement. \n64 A community may be undertaking other climate change impacts at the same time.\nInformation \nGathering\nMonitoring & \nEvaluation\nPublic \nEducation & \nCommunity \nEngagement\nAdaptation \nTools\n\n\nis prepared to live with\n\n  and preferred strategy\n\n     vulnerability\n\n      visualizations\n\n\n could modify sea level rise\n\n \nlocal impacts of sea level rise\n\n \nimplications of di˚erent \n \nadaptation tools\n\n \nand vulnerability\n\n     suitable adaptation \n     strategy\n\n     appropriate adaptation tools \n     to implement strategy\n\n \nchosen tools\n\n\nmeasurable indicators\n\n \nacceptable risk\nFigure 5 - Sea Level Rise Adaptation Framework\n', '24Tsunami2100 Floodplain Limiit2200 Floodplain Limit2010 Floodplain LimitMean Sea LevelUPLAND\nOCEAN2200 Sea Level Rise Planning Area\n2100 Sea Level Rise Planning Area\nOCEANUPLAND\nPlanCross-Section\nTsunami\n2200 FCL2100 FCL2010 FCLMean Sea Level\nInformation Gathering\nInformation gathering in the context of this Primer refers to the identi˜cation of the potential e˚ects of sea \nlevel rise, the identi˜cation of areas at risk from associated coastal hazards and the assessment of vulnerability. \nThis provides a baseline and serves to guide decision makers, stakeholders and the community.

These display potential year 2100 \n˛oodplain areas based on approximate \n˛ood construction levels (incorporating \n\nsea level rise).\n66The Paci˜c Climate Impacts Consortium \n\n(PCIC) also provides climate services \nand information to users across British \nColumbia. PCIC recognized that climate change impacts do not a˚ect every region of the province in the \nsame way and so developed the Plan2Adapt tool. Plan2Adapt generates maps, plots, and data describing \nprojected future climate conditions for regions throughout British Columbia. The impacts can be viewed \nby sector Œ agricultural, infrastructure, hydrology and land use planning Œ or by impact category Œ sea level \nrise/storm surge or possible ˛ooding.\n67 65 (Kerr Wood Leidal Associates Ltd. 2011)\n66 Note the presence of dikes or other ˛ood protection work has not been factored into the analysis and the ˛oodplain areas have not been \nprepared with high-resolution digital elevation models. Information displayed should be considered preliminary and used to highlight \n\nareas requiring high resolution coastal ˛oodplain maps.\n67 (University of Victoria n.d.)\n', '25In Quebec, the Ouranos consortium brings together expertise concerning climate change and adaptation \nto provide data for decision makers. Since 2000 they have worked in collaboration with various universities \nto research erosion rates in coastal zones. Additional work identi˜ed adaptation strategies for the \nmunicipalities most at risk from sea level rise. This collaborative research proved instrumental in the \ndevelopment of subsequent municipal regulations.\nThe Government of Newfoundland and Labrador has made a three-year commitment to establish a new \nCoastal Erosion and Mapping Program so that data and reports will be available to all communities for \nplanning and development purposes. The New Brunswick District Planning Commissions manage and \nplan for development in their areas and provide advice to the province and municipalities with respect \nto community planning. As an integral part of their mandate, Planning Commissions provide access to \nbuilding inspectors, GIS technicians and a development o˝cer to communities in their regions. In Halifax, \nNova Scotia, the local government has a current project to develop wave modeling for Halifax Harbour as \n\na critical addition to the ongoing development of the Halifax Regional Municipality™s overall adaptive land \nuse planning approach.\nFisheries and Oceans Canada Œ \nAquatic Climate Change Adaptation Services  Program \n68In 2011 the Government of Canada committed $16.5 million for implementation of a ˜ve-year aquatic \nclimate change program called the Aquatic Climate Change Adaptation Services Program.

Recent adaptation programs suggest a \nshift towards stakeholder engagement, improved planning tools and governance processes and away \nfrom technical solutions and physical measures alone.\n69 A collaborative approach to adaptation o˚ers \nan opportunity to improve public understanding and generate support. Ideally, public education and \ncommunity engagement should take place throughout the adaptation process to ensure transparency \n in the decision-making process. Approaches to engagement may include:\n\n \n\n\n68 (Fisheries and Oceans Canada 2013)\n69 (Barron, et al. 2012)\n', '26Public education and community engagement are vital components of decision making in a democracy \nand may also be legally required as part of a local planning process. They include addressing key issues \nsuch as:\n\n\nPublic education may be challenging. While sea level rise has recently gained increasing attention in \nthe public domain, the consequences and the need for adaptation may still be a ﬁhard sellﬂ because the \ntime frame is very long and changes will be incremental. This challenge must be recognized and taken \ninto consideration when designing public education and community engagement processes. Long term \nresidents can play an important role in communicating past extreme events.\nCanadian Examples\nIn British Columbia, the Corporation of Delta partnered with the University of British Columbia™s \n\nCollaborative for Advanced Landscape Planning (CALP) to develop future sea level rise scenarios using 2D \nand 3D visualisations. The visual materials generated by this project have been used by sta˚ and a citizens™ \nworking group to help them understand the impacts, assess the policy implications and measure the social \nacceptability of various adaptation strategies.\nIn Quebec, following the release of coastal erosion research in the Côte-Nord, over 100 information sharing \nmeetings and consultations took place. These meetings played an important role in developing public \nsupport for new coastal setbacks.\nScenario-Based Planning\nDue to the ‚forward looking™ nature of climate change planning and its reliance on climate models to \n\nestimate future impacts, there is an inherent degree of uncertainty involved in the planning process. \nOne popular community engagement approach for addressing and accounting for uncertainties in \nclimate predictions is scenario-based planning.\nScenario-based planning will typically begin with the creation of a baseline scenario of current land \nuse, management and other stressors. Predicted changes (e.g. expected/proposed development, sea \nlevel rise and increased storm surge) and possible elements of interest (e.g. ecological and community \ninfrastructure features) to these stressors are then modelled to create future scenarios. From these \nscenarios, decision makers can begin to identify thresholds of change Œ that is, points at which \nsigni˜cant impacts will be realized and various management options can be ‚tested™ to see which \nmaybe most e˚ective.\nSeveral tools have been developed in the United States to help speci˜cally with scenario based \nplanning. These include CommunityViz, NatureServe Vista and SLAMM (Sea Level A˚ecting Marshes \nModel). \n ', 'Adaptation Tools\n', '28Adaptation Tools\nThe following section provides an analysis of a variety of adaptation tools and their applicability in \ncommunities on Canada™s southern coasts. In each case, a general description of the tool is given, its \nimplementation is discussed, and enabling legislation is noted. In addition, economic, environmental and \nsocial criteria are discussed, as are the potential barriers or challenges to implementation.   \nA total of 21 tools are identi˜ed in this Primer. They have been organized into ˜ve general categories:\n\n  Planning tools\n identi˜ed in this Primer consist of local and regional government planning and \nmanagement objectives and policies, mapping of potential hazards, risk management and emergency \nplanning.  \n  Regulatory tools\n include the regulation of subdivision, land use and buildings. These regulatory tools \n\nrequire the approval of a decision maker or ﬁgatekeeperﬂ responsible for the protection of the public \ninterest. The gatekeeper may consist of the municipal council, regional board or other form of local \ngovernment, building inspector or subdivision approving o˝cer.\n  Land use change or restriction tools\n focus on land use change or the restriction of land use other \n\nthan through the regulatory functions noted above. Some of these tools are at the disposal of local \ngovernment and others have the potential to achieve local government goals indirectly, for example \n the acquisition of land through a Land Trust.\n  Structural tools\n (˛ood protection works) consist of physical structures on land or in water to protect \n\nland and buildings from coastal hazards. A wide range of hard protection or armouring works ˜t into \nthis category. This grouping can be further broken down into on-site and o˚-site works, which are also \nreferred to as property-speci˜c and linear shoreline protection measures.\n  Non-structural or soft armouring measures\n include the creation or restoration of wetlands, sand dune \n\nbuilding or rehabilitation and beach nourishment. Both sand dunes and beaches are naturally occurring \nfeatures, created by the interaction of wind and waves, and serve to dissipate the energy of storm surges \nand wave action.\n70Structural and non-structural protection methods are frequently used in combinations called hybrid \nshoreline protection systems. Examples include ‚living shorelines™, which manage coastal erosion by \nprotecting, restoring, enhancing or creating natural shoreline habitat that includes the use of structural \nmaterials in combination with sand, marsh vegetation and other natural planting for shoreline stabilization.\n70 (The Sustainable Planning Branch, New Brunswick Department of Environment and Local Government 2002)\n', '29Figure 7 Œ Summary of Sea Level Rise Adaptation Tools\nNon-Structural \nTools\n (Soft Armouring)\nPlanning Tools\nRegulatory\n Tools\nLand Use Change \n or Restriction \n Tools\nStructural Tools\n (Flood Protection \nWorks)\n1.

Objectives and Policies\nTool Description\nSetting objectives and policies is a key tool available to local governments to manage development. \nObjectives and policies may be included in a wide range of documents, and have di˚erent scope and \napplicability depending on the jurisdiction involved and the planning framework in place. Objectives \n and policies may be included in comprehensive plans, community plans, neighbourhood plans, strategic \nplans, and growth management strategies.  \nObjectives\n are often general in nature and may aim to accommodate future development, protect residents, \nmanage risk on land subject to hazards, and protect environmentally sensitive areas. \nPolicies\n are often more speci˜c and may identify how coastal hazards such as erosion and inundation \nshould be addressed. Policies may include setbacks to avoid coastal areas at risk, environmentally sensitive \n\ncriteria for development or other measures designed to reduce vulnerability and increase resilience.\nApplication\nObjectives and policies may be used as an adaptation tool in every coastal community in Canada. They may \n\nalso be added to existing policy frameworks such as O˝cial Community Plans or Regional Development \nStrategies. \nSetting objectives and policies often enables implementation of other tools. Implementation may be \nachieved through the use of regulatory tools such as a zoning bylaw or development permit. Land \n\nacquisition, land trust, structural protection and soft armouring all represent means of implementing \nobjectives and policies and other planning tools.\nEnabling Legislation\nThe \nLocal Government Act \nin B.C. requires all O˝cial Community Plans (OCPs) to identify restrictions on the \nuse of land that is subject to hazardous conditions (e.g. ˛ooding) or is environmentally sensitive. An OCP \nmust include the approximate location and phasing of roads, sewers and water systems. This may identify \ninfrastructure at risk and enable adaptations.\nThe \nLocal Government Act \nalso allows for development of regional growth strategies. Only ten of 29 regional \ndistricts have adopted regional growth strategies, however all coastal areas in B.C. with large populations \nare now covered. Regional growth strategies guide decisions on growth, change, and development. They \ncover a period of at least 20 years and include a comprehensive statement on the future of the region and \nsocial, economic and environmental objectives. Objectives deal with developing settlement patterns that \nminimize risks associated with natural hazards and protect environmentally sensitive areas.\n', '31Québec™s policy for the protection of riverbeds, shorelines, coastlines and ˛oodplains sets uniform setbacks \nbased on grade and requires that a permit be obtained for new construction near shorelines. The policy also \nbans all construction directly on the coastline. Regional County Municipalities (RCMs) were encouraged to \nintegrate measures for coastal protection, as outlined in the policy, within their regional master plans \n (Schema d™aménagement). As of 2012 all but seven of the 86 RCMs had adopted measures.\n71New Brunswick™s Coastal Areas Protection Policy establishes setbacks for permanent structures. This policy, \n\nwhich came into force in 2002, divided coastal areas into three sensitivity zones: \n\n\n\n\nThis policy is enforced through provincial environmental impact assessment legislation. Provincial legislation \nalso provides municipalities with the ability to incorporate these policies into their own requirements.\nNew Brunswick also has Watercourse and Wetland Alteration Regulations\n, which limit activities that take \nplace within or close to a watercourse or wetland. A permit is required before certain activities can take \nplace within 30 metres of a watercourse.\nPrince Edward Island has adopted shoreline setback regulations for subdivision and development under \nthe Provincial Planning Act\n. The province uses setbacks based on historical data, but is currently updating \nsetbacks using with aerial photos of coastlines. Under the \nEnvironmental Protection Act,\n P.E.I. also requires \nthat a watercourse, wetland and bu˚er zone activity permit be obtained for any temporary or permanent \nchange made to or near a watercourse or wetland. A permit is required for all such alterations made within \n 15 metres (49.2 feet) of any watercourse (including a coastal water body) or wetland boundary. \nIn Newfoundland and Labrador, the 1990\n Urban and Rural Planning Act\n makes provision for regional and \nmunicipal planning including the setting of plan objectives and policies. There are 281 municipalities in \n\nare outdated. The Department of Environment has a ﬁPolicy for Development in Shore Water Zonesﬂ. This \npolicy establishes criteria for issuing permits under the \nWater Resources Act\n, for all development activities in \nand a˚ecting shore water zones. In marine situations, the high water level of a water body must allow for \n\nmaximum waves, wind setup, storm surge and ultimate mean sea levels under global climatic forecasts for \na 1:100 year design. \nEvaluation and Governance Considerations \nEconomic\n Œ Economic considerations include the cost of developing and setting objectives and policies \nand the cost of implementing them. The cost to undertake the process is easily measurable while the cost \n\nof implementation is much more di˝cult to assess. \nThere are also economic costs if no objectives and policies are set. Economic obligations associated with \n development in hazardous areas may increase (e.g., development in areas at risk of coastal hazards \n with no protection measures). \nEnvironmental\n Œ Development restrictions in environmentally sensitive areas and areas subject to coastal \nhazards have long been addressed through municipal planning objectives and policies. Incorporating \nadaptation to sea level rise into these objectives and policies is a logical next step. \n71 (Martel 2012)\n', '32Social\n Œ Objectives and policies will need to complement other planning measures designed to manage \nresidential growth and other forms of development, recreation and open space needs, community facilities \nand other infrastructure needs. \nThe successful implementation of new objectives and policies often depends on a strong public education \nand consultation process as they are developed.\nImplementation Measures and Challenges \nChallenges include the time and resources required for public consultation and education. In a regional \n\ngoal-setting process such as a regional growth strategy, a mediation or arbitration process among the \ndi˚erent municipal governments may be required in order to achieve agreement. \nIn implementing policies and objectives, it is important to di˚erentiate binding and non-binding measures. \nFor example, the City of Vancouver increased Flood Construction Levels by an additional 1.0 m in January \n\n2012 as a recommended but non-binding measure to address increased risk due to sea level rise. This is \nexpected to be followed by a mandatory requirement following further review and technical study. \nAdvantages\nDisadvantages\nThere is an established history of setting objectives and \npolicies through a co-ordinated and comprehensive \n\napproach to land use planning and growth management \nin response to coastal hazards.\nThe planning process provides opportunities for public \ninvolvement and education. \nThe degree to which objectives are met and policies \nimplemented can be measured and monitored over time.\nResearch and policy development in adapting to sea level \n\nrise may be time consuming and require a commitment \n\nof sta˚ and ˜nancial resources. \nThe addition of policies to address sea level rise may add \ncontroversy, particularly ‚Avoid™ or ™ Retreat™ strategies.\n2. Coastal Hazard Mapping\nTool Description\nCoastal hazard maps identify areas susceptible to coastal hazards and the e˚ects of sea level \nrise. Mapping provides the technical basis for land use planning in coastal areas and enables the \ndevelopment of ˛oodplain bylaws. \nThe mapping of coastal areas at risk of ˛ooding or erosion is a vital tool for land use planning. Projected \nfuture sea levels can then be superimposed on a topographic map of coastal hazards to identify new areas \n\nsubject to hazards. \nA recent report commissioned by the B.C. government identi˜ed four steps to develop coastal ˛oodplain \nmaps. These were: \n\n\n\n these hazards, and \n\n', '33The report also suggested that coastal ˛oodplain maps contain the following elements:\n\n\n\n\n72Coastal ˛ood hazards are determined by the interaction of storm surges and waves with seabed \nbathymetry and coastal land cover. To e˚ectively map the extent of coastal hazards, accurate topographic \ndata is required, ideally with a contour interval of 1 m or less. The traditional method is to conduct ˜eld \nsurveys of the topography. However, LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data, collected from an aircraft \nusing a laser, is increasingly being used. \nLiDAR o˚ers both an accurate and economical means of topographic mapping, particularly where large \nsurface areas are involved. The set of elevation points generated by a LiDAR survey can be brought into a \ngeographical information system (GIS) and used to build surfaces that represent the earth™s topography \nwith great precision. This provides an ideal base map which can be used to determine coastal hazard risk.\n73 \nbe impractical and prohibitively expensive. Ground surveys may be used to supplement or monitor the \naccuracy of the results received from LiDAR or other technologies. \nGround surveys are still required to establish ground and ˛oodproof elevations at a speci˜c site where \n the FCL has been derived from a ˛oodplain map. Floodplain map topography should not be relied upon \n to establish speci˜c building elevations.\n74An engineering analysis is then used to map areas at risk. A review of long-term water level records is a key \n\nresource in assessing historic coastal ˛ood levels and return periods. For coastal areas, these records are \ncollected by tide gauges, operated by the Canadian Hydrographic Service (CHS) of the Department \n of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO). Coastal water level records are available on the DFO website.\n75 Hazard maps \ntypically show the physical boundaries of areas and what the hazard risks are based on risk analysis factors \nsuch as a design ˛ood. With sea level rise, hazard mapping will not only need to incorporate the increase \nin water levels, but the e˚ects of storm surge, wind and tides, in various combinations. These will vary \ndepending on the local climatic conditions\n. In recent years there has been a lack of sea ice during the winter months in several coastal areas of Atlantic \nCanada. This lack of sea ice must also be documented as a coastal hazard. The ice has historically provided a \nbu˚er for the coastline, but with reduced quantities, wave energy now often reaches the shoreline and hits \nexposed cli˚s, glacial deposits, sand dunes, sand spits, barrier bars, marshes, shoreline protection systems \nand other coastal features. The P.E.I. National Park has been monitoring ﬁice footﬂ\n76 in recent years as they \nhave observed signi˜cant damage to the park shoreline and dune systems after storm surges during \n winter months.\n72 (Kerr Wood Leidal Associates Ltd. 2011)\n73 (Birch Hill GeoSolutions 2008)\n74 (Kerr Wood Leidal Associates Ltd. 2011)\n75 www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca\n76 Ice frozen to the shore having a base at or below the low-water mark and formed as a result of the rise and fall of the tides, freezing spray, \nor stranded ice.\n', '34Application\nCoastal hazard mapping may be used to identify areas at risk due to the adverse e˚ects of sea level rise, \ndirect new development away from these high risk areas and manage development in areas where the risk \nis minimal or can be mitigated. Coastal hazard mapping complements and strengthens other adaptation \noptions and increases stakeholder awareness of areas at risk. As such, this tool may be applied to all coastal \nareas at risk of coastal hazards, irrespective of the other adaptation tools implemented. \nIn 1975 the federal government of Canada initiated the Flood Damage Reduction Program. Under this \nprogram, mapping of ˛oodplain regions was supported through a 50/50 cost shared basis with provinces. \nThrough this program over 700 communities in six provinces undertook ˛ood hazard mapping Œ of which a \nmajority were in Quebec. At a minimum, maps were required to identify areas subject to 1 in 100 year ˛ood \nevents. B.C. adopted a design ˛ood standard of 1 in 200 years, except on the Fraser River, where the 1948 \n˛ood of record was used. Atlantic Canada and Quebec adopted a ˛ood standard of 1 in 100 years. Mapping \nunder this program was completed by 2000.\nSince 2000, coastal hazard mapping has progressed sporadically across the country. As part of the Atlantic \nRegional Adaptation Collaborative, digital elevation mapping was completed for some coastal areas of \nNova Scotia, including the Chignecto Isthmus, where an evaluation of ˛ood risk to infrastructure was \nundertaken. \nThe Halifax Regional Municipality in collaboration with Natural Resources Canada has conducted ˛ood \nhazard mapping, including extreme event data. The results are reported in \nHalifax Harbour Extreme Water \nLevels in the Context of Climate Change, Scenarios for a 100-year Planning Horizon\n Geological Survey of \nCanada. This report includes an understanding of present and future sea level rise, vertical land motion, \n\nextreme water levels (combined tide and surge), harbour seiche and wave run-up.\nThe Province of New Brunswick maintains a coastal erosion database, which presents long-term coastline \nand shoreline migration rates. This data is generated through photogrammetric studies (air photos \nanalyses) conducted by N.B. Department of Natural Resources and collaborators (universities, colleges, \n\nNGOs, consultants, etc.). This data is used to determine appropriate setbacks when new developments are \nbeing assessed in coastal areas. \nIn B.C. current federal-provincial ˛ood management programs do not cover updates to hazard mapping or \nhydraulic analysis, although both have been included as secondary components in some projects. \nIn Prince Edward Island a 30 cm rise has been observed at the Charlottetown tide gauge since 1900. \nClimate change scenarios suggest that a sea level rise of 100 cm can be anticipated by 2100 with storm \nsurges likely to become more frequent and more intense. To identify vulnerable infrastructure and guide \nland use planning, hazard mapping has been undertaken across the province.\n', '35Evaluation and Governance Considerations \nEconomic\n Œ Developing hazard maps requires a commitment of both technical resources and funding. \n This may include resources for:\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nThe economic impacts of the maps themselves depends on a wide variety of factors, including how they \n\nare presented and distributed as well as how they are applied to planning and outreach activities. \nEnvironmental\n Œ Coastal hazard mapping may incorporate environmental data such as coastal habitats \n at risk or sensitive ecosystems and enable better environmental protection for areas at risk.\nSocial\n Œ Hazard maps identify housing, roads, underground services, and community resources subject \nto coastal hazards, allowing for more informed planning and emergency management decisions. Hazard \nmaps also enable public education and action, however, if a community is unaware of the bene˜ts of \ncoastal hazard mapping, they may prefer to see public money spent on more tangible ˛ood and erosion \nprotection measures.\nImplementation Measures and Challenges \nCoastal hazard maps have a wide variety of applications. GIS based mapping enables the detailed \ncalculation of land areas at risk, property values and building values as well as the identi˜cation of strategic \nassets. These economic calculations can also provide the basis for better understanding the social and \nenvironmental considerations a˚ecting vulnerable areas. \nMaps have long been used to support planning and development. In order for coastal hazard maps to \ne˚ectively reduce future coastal hazard risk and facilitate sustainable development, the consideration of \nhazard maps must be integrated into planning procedures and periodically updated.\nThe required expertise and modelling capacity may not be locally available, especially in smaller local \ngovernments. In addition, coastal hazards often cross jurisdictional boundaries. To pool limited resources \n\nand address trans-boundary impacts, work at a regional scale Œ with support from various levels of \ngovernment Œ is often the most e˚ective approach to hazard mapping. \n', '36Advantages\nDisadvantages\nThere is a history of using hazard maps to support \nplanning and development policies by identifying high \n\nrisk locations and steering development away from these \nareas. \nThe identi˜cation of new or emerging risk areas helps \nwith e˚ective emergency response plans. It is essential \n\nthat certain infrastructure, such as electricity supplies, \n\nsewage treatment, and services, such as the emergency \nservices, continue to function during a hazard event. The \ncreation of hazard maps allows communities to locate \n\nthese elements in low risk areas. Alternatively, mapping \n\nmay highlight a requirement to defend these elements \n\nfrom coastal hazards. \nCoastal hazard mapping can quantify what is at risk (e.g. \nthe number of houses or businesses). This can assist in \nmanaging risk by helping set priorities and determining \n\nthe most suitable strategy. \nThe creation of coastal hazard mapping promotes \ngreater awareness of the risks of sea level rise. This can \nbe bene˜cial in encouraging hazard zone residents to \nprepare for the occurrence of ˛ooding.\nBy identifying buildings at risk of ˛ooding, awareness \nraising campaigns can also be targeted at high risk \n\nproperties. \nIn itself, new coastal hazard mapping will not cause \n\na reduction in risk nor address sea level rise. The \n\ninformation must be integrated into other regulatory, \nland use change, and structural and non-structural tools \nbefore the full bene˜ts can be realised.\nTo realise the full bene˜ts of coastal hazard mapping, it \nis important to provide people in the areas at risk with \n\ninformation about emergency procedures and ways of \nreducing risk. If information on what to do in the event \n of an emergency is not provided, coastal hazard maps \n\nmay serve to increase fear and anxiety, as residents are \n\nmore aware of the risks.\nThe collection of topographic and bathymetric data \nto complement extreme water level and wave height \ninformation could be expensive.\nDue to the lack of observed extreme event data, more \nadvanced, accurate coastal hazard maps are likely to rely \n\non complex numerical models. This requires a degree of \n\nexpertise to implement.\nCoastal hazard maps need to be updated periodically \n to re˛ect changing climate and other factors.\n3. Risk Management\nTool Description\nRisk management is a process widely used to identify and manage the adverse impacts of a change in \nconditions. The magnitude of a risk is calculated by examining the probability of the occurrence of an \nevent and the severity of its impact.\n77 Risk management with respect to sea level rise and associated coastal \nhazards generally has two components. The ˜rst involves the identi˜cation, assessment, measurement, \n \nand prioritization of risks from sea level rise (risk assessment). The second involves selecting and \nimplementing management measures. The measurement process may be quantitative, such as calculating \nthe probability of a ˛ood in excess of current linear protection, or it may be qualitative, documenting \nincreasing vulnerability and reduced resilience. Coastal hazards due to sea level rise may include the risk \n of a major disaster such as a dike failure as well as risks from gradual changes such as increasing salinization \nof groundwater. \nA risk assessment may have aspects that a˚ect people, the environment and the economy. Risk \nmanagement methodologies can also provide a way to explore public attitudes and perceptions of risk Œ \ninformation which can be fed back into the assessment.\n78 The setting of priorities re˛ects the importance \n of the coastal hazard and leads to a discussion on how those risks should be managed.\n77 (Richardson and Otero 2012)\n78 (Richardson and Otero 2012)\n', '37Application\nSea level rise has been identi˜ed as a risk in the academic literature for at least two decades. The design of sea \nlevel rise risk-management strategies relies on sea level rise projections, which are constantly being revised \nbased on new data and research. Risks due to sea level rise have increased in recent years due to various \naspects of climate change, including the more rapid melting of glaciers, higher water and atmospheric \ntemperature readings around the globe and more intense storm activity. As noted previously, considerable \nregional variation in sea level rise will take place. \nWith sea level rise, increased protection measures will be required just to maintain the same level of \nprotection (i.e., 1:100 years or 1:200 years) that has been historically provided. When the Canadian Flood \nDamage Reduction Program was created in 1975, minimum federal standards with respect to acceptable \n˛ood risk were set at a 1 in 100 year ˛ood. Should a higher level of protection be called for, additional \nmeasures will be required. Whether the standard of protection remains the same or is increased, other \napproaches to risk management may be required. These may include tools such as land acquisition, land \n\ntrust, covenant or easement and soft armouring to reduce impact. \nEnabling Legislation\nA risk assessment does not require speci˜c enabling legislation. It can occur in the preparation of an O˝cial \n\nCommunity Plan or other planning process as authorized by provincial legislation. Risk management may \nalso be undertaken as part of an emergency planning and preparedness initiative. For example, In Québec, \nthe 2001 Loi sur la sécurité civile\n (Law on civil security), Chapter IV, Section III obliges municipal o˝cials to \npublicly communicate all known major risks and develop regulations for risk management.\nEvaluation and Governance Considerations\nEconomic\n Œ Risk management involves a rigorous process of comparing and selecting the most \nappropriate risk reduction measures. It can also include an analysis of the cost of ﬁdoing nothing.ﬂ A cost-\n\nbene˜t analysis Œ used to determine how well, or how poorly, a planned action will turn out Œ can assist \nthe risk management process. A cost bene˜t analysis is most commonly undertaken where the costs and \nbene˜ts can be quanti˜ed in ˜nancial terms, to enable comparability. It relies on the addition of positive \nfactors and the subtraction of negative ones to determine a net result.\n', '38The two main applications of a cost-bene˜t analysis for risk management with respect to coastal hazards \nare: \n\naction feasible?)\n\n\ninvolves comparing the total expected cost of each option against the total expected bene˜ts, to see \n if the bene˜ts outweigh the costs, and by how much.\nA ‚multiple account™ cost-bene˜t analysis recognizes that all values are complex and that not all consequences \ncan be expressed in monetary terms or incorporated into one summary measure of net bene˜t. \nEnvironmental\n Œ Risk management may be used to reduce sea level rise risks to environmental assets and \nspecies at risk. The protection of wetlands is of particular importance due to historic losses, as are intertidal \nareas, due to their high productivity.\nSocial\n Œ Social criteria is embedded into most risk management processes. Assessments identify acceptable \nrisk levels, community assets needing protection, and when or if a di˚erent strategy should be adopted \n\nto respond to the long-term consequences of sea level rise. The experience of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 \ndemonstrated the extreme vulnerability of persons lacking mobility, particularly those with low income \nand the residents of nursing homes.\nImplementation Measures and Challenges \nImplementation of risk management measures depends on the overall strategy adopted and the tool \nor combination of tools selected to manage identi˜ed risk within acceptable levels. Challenges include \nselecting an acceptable level of risk, selecting the most appropriate tools to manage the risk, and \ncommitting the capital and maintenance costs required to implement the risk management plan.\nAdvantages\nDisadvantages\nA long-term perspective is often required to manage \nrisks to large scale linear infrastructure. Risk management \n\nallows for a phased or cumulative risk management \napproach.\nRisk management may involve a rigorous, defensible \nanalytic approach with reliable information used to \n support decision making.\nRisk management can be an essential tool to help \ndetermine the most appropriate response to coastal \nhazards.\nThere may be a signi˜cant cost. However, the cost \n must be measured against the risk.\nThe absence of detailed studies may impede some \ninitiatives but should not prevent the use of interim \nmeasures to reduce risk (e.g. minimum setback and \nelevation from the natural boundary or other potential \n\nrisk). \n', '394. Emergency Planning and Preparedness\nTool Description\nEmergency planning and preparedness measures are undertaken in advance of a disaster. Coastal ˛ooding \nmay result in property damage, damage to or destruction of property contents, economic losses due to \nsevered transportation links and other damaged infrastructure. It may also result in loss of land due to \nerosion, business disruption in the a˚ected area, population/community displacement, health and safety \nhazards and even death. E˚ective emergency planning and preparedness reduces the damage caused by \nsuch events. \nPost-disaster management refers to measures undertaken during and after a disaster and are discussed \nseparately following the discussion of adaptation tools.\nApplication\nEmergency planning and preparedness measures may be undertaken in all coastal areas at risk of coastal \n\nhazards, irrespective of the other adaptation tools implemented. \nBetween 1970 and 2013, the federal government administered the Joint Emergency Preparedness Program \n(JEPP) to support disaster preparedness through funds provided to provincial and territorial governments. \nThis program provided ˜nancial assistance of up to 75% of a speci˜c project to a maximum of $3,000,000, \n\nand focused speci˜cally on increasing local government emergency response capability.\nIn B.C., under the \nEmergency Program Act\n, local authorities have primary responsibility for responding to \nemergencies and must have an emergency plan in place to address potential ˛ood events and maintain \npublic safety. The Province provides support to local authorities depending on the magnitude of the event.\nLocal authorities:\n\n\n\n\n\nalleviate the e˚ects of an emergency or disaster.\nThe emergency management of ˛oods consists of several phases. This tool covers the ˜rst phase Œ \n\nemergency planning and preparedness for a ˛ood. Later phases concern ˛ood response and recovery/\ndisaster ˜nancial assistance. These later phases are critically important but are not considered part of the \nPrimer toolkit.\nIn 1999, to assist local and diking authorities to prepare a ˛ood response plan, the B.C. Water Management \nBranch and the Provincial Emergency Program (PEP) published the Flood Planning and Response Guide \nfor British Columbia.\n79 This document includes sections on ˛ood prevention, ˛ood damage prevention, the \npreparation and implementation of a ˛ood response plan and post ˛ood management.\n79 The Guide also provides assistance for preparation of a Flood Response Plan. More detail is available at \n http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/wsd/public_safety/flood/fhm-2012/flood_emg_response.html\n. ', '40Emergency Management B.C. stresses the importance of volunteers in dealing with emergencies of various \ntypes, including ˛oods. People are encouraged to establish Neighbourhood Emergency Preparedness \nPrograms to help individuals and neighbours prepare to be self-su˝cient for an extended period. \nVolunteers are also important in the implementation of emergency response plans.\nIn Nova Scotia, under the \nEmergency Management Act\n, each municipality is required to establish and \nmaintain an emergency measures bylaw, an emergency measures organization with an appointed \ncoordinator, establish an advisory committee consisting of members of the municipal council and prepare \nand approve an emergency measures plan.\n80 Similar provisions are in place in New Brunswick and Prince \nEdward Island. \nIn P.E.I. the O˝ce of Public Safety assists communities in upgrading their existing emergency response \nplans. Their municipal emergency management guide outlines key components and steps to help \ncommunities to develop plans, create exercises and ensure resources have been identi˜ed before an \n\nemergency occurs. A municipal self-assessment tool helps municipalities identify key areas of focus and \nto ensure hazards are clearly understood. Emergency planning templates are available for municipalities \nand local businesses to create an emergency plan speci˜c to the community or business requirements and \nemergency training is o˚ered to individuals and organizations that have a role to play in an emergency. \nEvaluation and Governance Considerations\nEconomic\n Œ Economic considerations include the cost and resources of preparing emergency plans, \nco-ordinating with other agencies and obtaining resources for plan implementation. Input in the form of \n\nassistance Œ technical and monetary Œ for the preparation of emergency plans or planning may come from \nhigher government departments, agencies, and NGOs.\n81Environmental\n Œ This tool is not intended to address environmental issues.\nSocial\n Œ The primary objective of this tool is the protection of human life, followed by the maintenance \nof essential services and the protection of infrastructure and buildings. This tool lays the groundwork to \nprepare for a possible emergency and undertake planning measures including the evacuation of an area \n to protect human life. \nImplementation Measures and Challenges \nChallenges include securing adequate resources, updating plans and undertaking disaster simulation \n\nexercises.

Regulation of Land Use\nTool Description\nLand use can be regulated through neighbourhood plans, character guidelines, capital works plans, \nstrategic plans, growth management plans and setback regulations. Land use can also be regulated \nthrough the establishment of appropriate zoning within areas subject to or potentially subject to coastal \nhazards. Zoning can regulate a wide range of activities, including restrictions on land uses, land use \ndensities, setbacks, siting circumstances and servicing standards.\nApplication\nLand use regulation Œ especially zoning Œ is a tool available in all provinces, although the speci˜c scope \nof regulation ranges from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The three key elements of land use regulation \npertaining to sea level rise and coastal hazards consist of minimum building setbacks from coastal hazards \nor structural protection from coastal hazards, minimum elevation of buildings in relation to ˛ood risk, and \nrestrictions on land use. This tool can also be used to create new composite zones, such as a Sea Level Rise \nPlanning Areas.\nEnabling Legislation\nIn B.C., under Section 903 of the \nLocal Government Act\n, a local government may by bylaw divide the whole \n\nor part of the municipality or regional district into zones, name each zone, establish their boundaries \nand regulate the use of land, siting and density of buildings and other structures within each one. This \nlegislation could be used to create new zones with respect to coastal areas and enable a local government \nto regulate the use of land.\nIn B.C., provincial guidelines\n82 call for new construction containing habitable space to be located above \nthe historical 1 in 200 year ˛ood event plus an additional safety margin (called freeboard) to deal with \nuncertainty. The resulting elevation is called the Flood Construction Level (FCL). Section 910 of the \nLocal \nGovernment Act\n allows a local government to designate as a ˛ood plain, by bylaw, any area where it \nconsiders that ˛ooding may occur on land. When an area is designated as a ˛ood plain, the bylaw may \nspecify setbacks Œ based on the provincial guidelines Œ from the water or a dike and what structural \nsupport is required to elevate a ˛oor system (or mobile home pad) above the ˛ood level. \nOther provinces have similar land use regulations. Zoning restrictions, minimum setbacks, lot grading, \nminimum building elevations and erosion protection are all commonly used to mitigate hazard risks. \nIn Quebec, provincial setback lines di˚er based on regional variations and available data on erosion rates. \nMost of the coastal areas require a 10Œ15 metre setback for the protection of the shorelines as established \nby provincial policy in 1987. From 2000 to 2004 a group of ˜ve ministries conducted precise erosion \nrate research in the Côte-Nord region. From this research setbacks of between 60 and 160 metres were \nsuggested for that region, depending upon the rate of erosion. However, these suggested setbacks were \nnot set as policy and therefore not widely adopted as regulation. In 2011, a uniform 30-metre setback \nfor all other coastal communities was proposed. Many municipalities, however, have requested similar \n\nresearch and detailed erosion maps as were completed for the Côte-Nord to ensure they have irrefutable \ndata in the face of potential legal challenges by coastal property owners. The Province is in the process of \ncommissioning detailed studies on erosion and subsidence rates in order to develop up-to-date precision \nmaps for all the shorelines of Quebec. Studies are being completed one area at a time in order of priority \nrelated to vulnerability.\n83 82 Flood Hazard Area Land Use Management Guidelines (May 2004)\n83 (Désgagnés 2013)\n', '42Setbacks in Îles-de-la-Madeleine\nUpdated maps for the municipality of Îles-de-la-Madeleine were completed in late 2012 by UQAR on \ncommission by the province. Once all the data has been translated into a directive by the province to \nthe municipality, it has 120 days to integrate the new setback rules into its master plans, as per the loi \nsur l™aménagement et l™urbanisme (Planning and Urban Planning Law), article 56.14.\n84The municipality of Îles-de-la-Madeleine is one of the most vulnerable areas of Quebec. Zoning \n\nregulations adopted in 2010 increased the setback from 15 to 30 metres. Although a provincial \ndirective was not issued, this increase occurred as a result of public consultation and multi-stakeholder \nresearch on sea level rise in Îles-de-la-Madeleine, undertaken by the Ouranos Consortium. \n84In New Brunswick, the \nCommunity Planning Act\n has a provision for municipalities and rural communities to \n\nenact a ˛ood risk area bylaw with provincial approval. Once such an area has been established, the bylaw \ncan specify engineering standards, designs and techniques for development in ˛ood risk areas. This \nAct\n also allows for land use planning throughout the province and allows for the creation of District Planning \n\nCommissions. These Commissions are responsible for providing building, development and planning \nservices to municipalities and unincorporated areas of the province.\nIn Nova Scotia, the Province has designated land use or zoning powers to the municipalities through the \nMunicipal Government Act\n and the Halifax Regional Municipality Charter\n. These powers allow municipalities \nto develop planning strategies and bylaws to regulate land use.\n85 In P.E.I, zoning and development bylaws have been enacted in a number of coastal municipalities, \n\npursuant to the \nPlanning Act Subdivision and Development Regulations\n. These municipalities must follow \nthe provisions of the \nEnvironmental Protection Act Watercourse and Wetland Protection Regulations\n, under provincial legislation. Municipalities can alter the setback requirements speci˜ed in the \nPlanning Act \n\nSubdivision and Development Regulations\n for setbacks from coastal areas and beaches. \n84 (Province of Nova Scotia 2009)\n85 (Province of Nova Scotia 2009)\nCap Bimet, Grand \n\nBarachois, N.B.\n', '43In Newfoundland and Labrador, responsibility for land use planning is shared by the provincial, federal, \nmunicipal, Innu Nation and Nunatsiavut governments. The Department of Municipal A˚airs generally \nfocuses on communities, although the \nUrban and Rural Planning Act\n provides a broader mandate that \nincludes regional planning, the setting of plan objectives and policies, zoning and implementation \nmeasures. The Department of Environment and Conservation oversees ownership and use of the seabed \nwithin harbours and bays in the province and reviews all applications for land use to ensure compliance \nwith existing regulations and policies.\nThe Department™s \nPolicy for Development in Shore Water Zones\n establishes criteria for issuing permits for all \ndevelopment activities in and a˚ecting shore water zones.\n86 This policy does not permit in˜lling, drainage, \ndredging, channelization, or removal of surface or underwater vegetation on or along shore water zones \n\nwhich could aggravate ˛ooding problems. Shoreline activities on crown land are covered by provincial \nrules, though some municipalities do have development guidelines that restrict what can happen in \nthe bu˚er zone. All individuals applying for unencumbered Crown land in Newfoundland and Labrador \nmust maintain a 15 metre bu˚er zone between the shoreline and the boundary of the issued title though \nthere is a reduction to 10 metres for residential lots and some older land grants are exempt. As in other \nprovincial jurisdictions, municipalities and regional planning authorities can implement measures under \n\ntheir own plans and bylaws to protect coastal areas from sea level rise, ˛ooding, erosion or other hazards. \nNewfoundland and Labrador has two regional planning authorities responsible for planning issues in their \nrespective areas. As an example, the regional planning authority for Corner Brook Œ Humber Valley has \nincluded climate change adaptation as an issues to consider in their planning process.\n87Evaluation and Governance Considerations\nEconomic\n Œ Land use restrictions, by their nature, confer development rights, with di˚erent rights for \ndi˚erent zones and areas. While these restrictions have signi˜cant economic implications, they may be \n\nintroduced in the public interest, for example, to meet changing community needs and manage competing \ninterests and con˛ict.\nEnvironmental\n Œ Regulation may facilitate identi˜cation and protection of environmentally sensitive areas \nand manage environmental hazards.\nSocial\n Œ Regulation and zoning must be balanced to accommodate future population needs, while \nprotecting infrastructure from hazards and locating essential services in low risk areas.\nImplementation Measures and Challenges \nImplementation measures include the adoption of a zoning bylaw or other land use regulation by a local \n\ngovernment. Challenges include having the information resources or capabilities to identify areas at risk \nand the degree of risk to be addressed. Related tools include topographic mapping to identify the location \nof areas at risk, and engineering expertise to address appropriate protection or adaptation measures \nneeded to avoid the risk or reduce the risk to acceptable levels. Technical requirements to address coastal \n˛ood risks may be expensive. Public acceptance may also pose a challenge.\nThere may be challenges in cases where there is con˛icting information on appropriate land use \nrestrictions. For example, in Quebec, Côte-Nord established a setback line using the probability of a \n 1-in-100 year ˛ood event. This con˛icted with previous proposal to establish setbacks using the probability \nof a 1-in-25 year ˛ood event. This situation has resulted in potential grounds for legal challenges.\n86 A shore water zone means the land that is intermittently occupied by water as a result of the naturally ˛uctuating surface water level in \na body of water which can be either a fresh or salt water body and, in either case, the low water mark and high water mark of the water \n\nbody de˜ning the edges of the shore water zone. \n87 See draft Humber Valley Regional Land Use Plan 2011-12.\n', '44Advantages\nDisadvantages\nZoning or ˛oodplain related bylaws allow the restriction \nof land uses based on identi˜ed risks within a speci˜ed \n\narea (e.g., ˛oodplain).\nZoning gives a local government great ˛exibility in \naddressing di˚erent conditions and needs within its \nphysical boundaries.\nZoning is well suited to public education and \ninvolvement.\nLocal government may not be able to impose zoning that \n\nwill render the land sterile (i.e., unable to be used) but it \n\ncan restrict the way in which land and buildings are used \nso that risks can be addressed.\nTechnical supporting documentation to address \ncoastal ˛ood risks may be expensive (e.g., ˛oodplain \n\nmapping, design briefs, updated ˛ood risk assessment, \n\nimplementation measures to adapt to or reduce \n ˛ood risk).\nInterim measures may lack technical documentation \nbut can be undertaken at modest cost (e.g. sea level rise \n\nstudy area).\n2. Subdivision Regulation\nTool Description\nSubdivision regulation can be used to prevent or establish conditions for the subdivision of land at risk \nfrom coastal hazards associated with sea level rise. A proposed subdivision must go through a review \nprocess, which culminates in the approval (including approval with conditions) or refusal of the proposed \nsubdivision by the Approving O˝cer or other appointed o˝cial. A subdivision refers to establishing a \nseparate title of land. This can include a simple property, bare land strata lot, or strata unit (e.g., townhouse, \nrow house, or condominium unit in an apartment building).\nApplication\nThis tool applies to the subdivision of land at risk of coastal hazards due to sea level rise and can be utilized \n\nin conjunction with zoning. \nEnabling Legislation\nIn most regions across Canada, subdivision decisions are governed by some form of an approving o˝cer. \n\nThe nomenclature used to identify this approving o˝cer, their speci˜c role and level of government where \nthe position is located varies in Quebec and Atlantic Canada but their basic ﬁgatekeeperﬂ function is similar.\nIn B.C., the subdivision of land is an administrative responsibility given to an Approving O˝cer and is \nseparate from the responsibility of an elected Council or Board. An Approving O˝cer appointed by a \n\nmunicipality is typically the Municipal Engineer or Chief Planning O˝cer. For small municipalities, the \nApproving O˝cer may be the Chief Administrative O˝cer or a person contracted to undertake that \nresponsibility. In non-municipal areas of regional districts, the Approving O˝cer is an employee of the \nMinistry of Transportation and Infrastructure. \nUnder Section 86 of the \nLand Title Act\n, an Approving O˝cer may refuse to approve a plan for subdivision \nif the land is subject to, or could reasonably be expected to be subject to, hazards such as ˛ooding and/or \nerosion. A subdivision can also be refused if the cost to government of providing public utilities or other \nworks and services would be excessive or if the subdivision would adversely a˚ect the natural environment.\nSection 86 also allows the Approving O˝cer to require a report by a quali˜ed professional that the land \nmay be used safely. Under Section 219 of the B.C. \nLand Title Act,\n the report is included in a covenant and \nregistered as a charge on title and remains on the title of any parcels created by the subdivision, regardless \nof future ownership. \n', '45Variations occur in other provinces. Some but not all Nova Scotia municipalities have Municipal Planning \nStrategies or bylaws to regulate zoning and subdivision in place. Municipalities or non-incorporated areas \nmust still comply with the provincial \nSubdivision Regulations\n under the Municipal Government Act\n and the Environmental Protection Act\n in Nova Scotia. \nIn P.E.I. the \nEnvironmental Protection Act\n requires an environmental impact assessment for undertakings which \ncould have a signi˜cant e˚ect on the environment including an e˚ect on any unique, rare or endangered \nfeature of the environment, or an e˚ect which causes public concern. This legislation has broad application and \nincludes speci˜c references to the alteration of wetlands, interfering with the movement of sand on a beach \nor sand dune, and the destruction of natural stabilizing features such as vegetation. As a result, subdivision \napplications are reviewed through the provincial Environmental Impact Assessment process prior to issuing \ndevelopment permits. N.B., N.S. and N.L. all have similar environmental provisions in place.\nEvaluation and Governance Considerations\nEconomic\n Œ Economic considerations include the cost of allowing or avoiding development in an area \nsubject to coastal hazards, the cost of providing ˛ood protection, and the cost of adapting to the risk. In the \n\nevent of a ˛ood, or if the risk increases and increased structural protection is required (e.g. increased dike \nheight), these costs may be borne by di˚erent levels of government.\nEnvironmental\n Œ Environmental considerations involve the e˚ect on the natural environment of the \nsubdivision due to sea level rise and coastal hazards. Subdivision regulation can be used to address \nenvironmental issues such as suitability of land use and development impact.\nSocial\n Œ Various public stakeholders and potential land owners may be a˚ected by the approval or \nrefusal to approve a subdivision. An O˝cial Community Plan or a similar guiding document may provide \n\n\nparticularly for residential use.\nImplementation Measures and Challenges \nThis tool relies heavily on accurate information and coastal hazard mapping to provide grounds for \n\nthe approval or refusal of a subdivision. Implementation requires that an Approving O˝cer or similar \ndesignate exercise their authority to allow or refuse the subdivision of land at risk from coastal hazards. \nWhere the nature and extent of the risk has not been determined, the Approving O˝cer can withhold \nsubdivision approval pending a report from a quali˜ed professional. A quali˜ed professional (i.e., engineer \n\nO˝cer still has the discretion to reject the subdivision.\nAdvantages\nDisadvantages\nMost local governments have the legal mandate to \nestablish by bylaw the conditions under which the \n\nsubdivision of land can proceed.\nThe role of the Approving O˝cer provides for some \ndegree of separation from political in˛uence. The ability \nof an Approving O˝cer to protect the public interest \n\nby refusing to approve a subdivision has been well \n\nestablished by case law.\nThis tool allows the conditions of future development \n to be regulated. \nThe loss of potential development value could result \nin resistance from developers. Reducing subdivision of \n\ncoastal land should not be undertaken ad hoc or without \nsupporting guiding policy or a strategy in place.\nWithout the identi˜cation of coastal hazard areas at risk \nof ˛ooding and erosion, it is di˝cult for the approving \n\nbody to decline subdivision on the grounds of safety.\n\nthe prescribed scope of authority. The quality of decision \nmaking is dependent on the capabilities of those \nappointed. \n', '463. Development Permit\nTool Description\nA Development Permit is a form of land use regulation distinctive to B.C. It is identi˜ed separately because \nit combines policy objectives and guidelines with site speci˜c regulation. A Development Permit can \nregulate development for a variety of purposes, two of which are applicable to sea level rise:\n\n\nIn the former case, a Development Permit Area (DPA) may specify areas of land that must remain free of \ndevelopment, except in accordance with any conditions contained in the permit, or require speci˜ed \nnatural features or areas to be preserved, protected, restored or enhanced in accordance with the permit. \nIn the latter case, a DPA may specify areas of land that may be subject to ˛ooding, mud ˛ows, or torrents of \n\ndebris, and specify the guidelines under which the objectives will be addressed. In each case, the purpose \nof the Development Permit is for the speci˜ed objectives to be met prior to a development proceeding. \nApplication\nThis tool is used to identify areas where special conditions apply. The objectives of the Development Permit \nmust be established and guidance given for addressing the objectives. While this tool is speci˜c to B.C. \nlegislation, there are other similar processes in Atlantic Canada. For example, Halifax Regional Municipality \nis managing waterfront development in Halifax Harbour by development agreements in which proponents \nmust account for sea level rise.\nEnabling Legislation\nIn B.C., a local government can establish Development Permit Areas under Section 919.1 of the \nLocal \nGovernment Act\n. A DPA and guidelines can be included in an O˝cial Community Plan or a zoning bylaw. \nWhere a DPA has been designated by bylaw, no subdivision, building construction or alteration, or \nalteration of land can proceed unless a Development Permit has ˜rst been issued by the local government. \nIn order to address the hazardous conditions speci˜ed in the DPA, the local government may require that \nthe applicant provide a report certi˜ed by a professional engineer. When a local government has issued a \nDevelopment Permit, it must ˜le a notice in the Land Title O˝ce that the land is subject to the conditions \nspeci˜ed in the Development Permit. If an OCP designates areas as requiring a Development Permit, this \n\nmust be issued prior to the subdivision of land within the area and the construction of, addition to or \nalteration of a building or other structure.\nEvaluation and Governance Considerations\nEconomic\n Œ The creation of Development Permit Areas and the granting or refusal of applications with \nrespect to these areas involves an additional step in the development and permitting process. The cost \n\nof the independent professional and the cost of meeting the Development Permit conditions can also be \nconsiderable. The onus is on the applicant to demonstrate that land that might otherwise not be developed \ncan be done so safely.\nEnvironmental\n Œ A DPA is one of the few tools available to a local government where the primary focus can \nbe on protection of the natural environment and biodiversity. Examples could include sand dunes, coastal \n\nblu˚s, and beaches.\nSocial\n Œ The establishment of a Development Permit Area in an OCP or zoning bylaw requires a public \nhearing.\n', '47Implementation Measures and Challenges \nImplementation requires that an O˝cial Community Plan designate a DPA. This includes an amending bylaw \nand public hearing. Once a DPA is in place, a resolution of approval is required from the local government for \na speci˜c development. The main challenge is preparing background studies of hazards and environmentally \nsensitive areas to justify the DPA.\nAdvantages\nDisadvantages\nThe use of a Development Permit enables land use \nplanning objectives to be implemented prior to a \n\ndevelopment proceeding. \nA DPA can be included in an O˝cial Community Plan \nwith a narrative describing the objectives that justify the \ndesignation and specifying the guidelines for addressing \n\nthe objectives, accompanied by a map.  \nThe scope is very broad, as it includes subdivisions, \nbuilding construction (whether or not a building permit \nis required) and alteration of land (e.g. re-grading, soil \nremoval or soil deposition). \nThe use of a Development Permit allows for an \nindependent professional to address risk (i.e., professional \n\nengineer with relevant expertise) at the applicant™s \n\nexpense.\nNo change in existing legislation is needed to create \n a Sea Level Rise Development Permit Area or Coastal \nHazard Development Permit Area.\nUse of this tool requires a notice to be ˜led in the Land \nTitle O˝ce. As a result, any purchaser is deemed to be \n\nnoti˜ed of hazardous conditions. \nHazardous areas must be documented and identi˜ed \n\nprior to their designation. Smaller jurisdictions may lack \n\nthe necessary planning or technical resources. \nThe use of a Development Permit is an additional \nprocedural requirement for a developer or landowner. \nHowever, the additional time by itself can be as little as \n\nfour weeks and a Development Permit can be processed \n\nconcurrently with a rezoning or subdivision application. \nObjectives and guidelines need to be well crafted. A \nDevelopment Permit cannot be turned down by the local \ngovernment if the speci˜ed objectives and guidelines are \n\nmet. This can be an advantage as well as a disadvantage.\n4. Building Regulation\nTool Description\nLocal communities have a tools which can be used to in˛uence the manner in which buildings are situated \nand constructed.\nApplication\nThis tool is applicable to all building construction or signi˜cant retro˜ts. The use of this tool is the last \n\nopportunity to avoid exposure to hazards, including coastal hazards.\nEnabling Legislation\nUnder the terms of the \nConstitution Act\n, building regulation in Canada is the responsibility of provincial and \n\nterritorial governments. The Canadian Commission on Building and Fires Codes works with stakeholders \nand researches to develop a model National Building Code. Most provinces and territories have adopted \nthe National Building Code or adapted it with variations and additions. The National Building Code does \nnot have speci˜c design requirements to protect buildings from coastal hazards but does ensure that \nbuildings are constructed to certain safety and design standards.\n', '48Although not all local governments in British Columbia have chosen to enforce the provincial \ncode, technically, the code applies throughout the province. In addition, through powers provided \nunder section 910 of the \nLocal Government™s Act\n municipalities may introduce certain construction \nrequirements in a ˛oodplains.\nThe City of Vancouver is unique among municipalities in B.C. It has its own enabling provincial legislation \ncalled the Vancouver Charter\n. Under this charter, Vancouver has developed a building bylaw which is \nbased on the B.C. Building Code\n, with local amendments. This bylaw regulates buildings on lands subject to \n˛ooding by establishing minimum ˛ood construction levels (FCLs), specifying construction materials, and \nservice equipment installation, and allowing for covenants on a property title which acknowledge the risk \nof ˛ood damage.\nThe\n B.C. Community Charter\n provides an alternative way that building restrictions may be imposed to \naddress ˛ood hazards. Under section 56 of this \nAct\n, a municipal building inspector may withhold the \nissuance of a building permit until satis˜ed the land can be safely used and can require a geotechnical \nreport by a quali˜ed professional if construction is proposed on land likely to be subject to hazards such \n as ˛ooding or erosion.\nA building permit can be refused until the owner agrees to a covenant on the property title stating that the \nland will only be used in the manner certi˜ed in the report. Regional districts have similar authorities under \nsection 695 of the \nLocal Government Act\n.In Quebec, adaptation to sea level rise is currently not addressed in provincial regulations governing the \nauthority of local governments to deal with zoning bylaws, home-owner building permits or subdivisions. \nThe province develops planning strategies, then Regional County Municipalities (RCMs) are responsible for \nintegrating the strategies in their Schémas d™aménagement (regional plans), and the municipalities within \nthe RCMs then enact bylaws and regulations to implement the measures in the Schéma. The province \ndevelops policies and makes recommendations they hope the local authorities (cities) and regional \n\nauthorities (RCMs) will adopt, however, there is no forced compliance from one level to the next. In some \ncases, depending on the type of construction, permits can be issued by regional or provincial authorities.\nIn Atlantic Canada there is a general provision under provincial planning legislation for the granting \nof building permits in non-incorporated areas. In Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, regional planning \n\ncommissions can generate regional plans and bylaws. Most of the larger municipalities in all four Atlantic \nProvinces have the authority to prepare their own o˝cial plan and bylaws. Where o˝cial plans and bylaws \nexist, development o˝cers or building inspectors issue permits. In some cases, there are provisions in place \nto restrict development in areas vulnerable to coastal hazards. In Prince Edward Island, the \nPlanning Act\n, (Section 8), provides for the regulation of land use activities in non-incorporated areas. The \nPlanning Act\n, Subdivision and Development Regulations\n, provides measures for setbacks in coastal areas of a minimum \n\nwidth of 60 feet (18.3 metres) or 60 times the annual erosion rate for the area (Section 16). In Newfoundland \n\nand Labrador, the \nUrban and Rural Planning Act\n empowers the formation of regional planning commissions \nin the province, and there are currently two commissions in place.\nEvaluation and Governance Considerations\nEconomic\n Œ Building regulation as an adaptation tool has two primary purposes: the protection of property \nand public safety. The economic costs associated with the use of this tool are not easy to quantify due to \n\nthe wide variety of circumstances that may apply. Local government review and processing costs and legal \ncosts are likely to be modest to moderate. Similarly, the cost of implementing protective measures vary \nwidely. In some cases a project may have to be abandoned if a quali˜ed professional cannot certify that a \nbuilding can be safely constructed for the intended use or that the cost for doing so would be excessive.\n', '49Environmental\n Œ Building restrictions as an adaptation tool only address identi˜ed hazards including \nnatural hazards such as erosion and ˛ooding.\nThis regulatory tool is not intended to address environmental criteria. Other planning tools that typically \noccur at an earlier stage in the development process should be used to address environmental criteria (e.g., \ngrowth management policies, easement, land purchase, subdivision, and zoning).\nSocial\n Œ This tool is designed to address public safety. The intent of this tool is to ensure that the occupants \nof a building are not subject to excessive risk. If a building cannot safely be constructed in a particular \nlocation or if the cost of doing so is economically prohibitive then it will not be constructed, thus reducing \nthe risk to people and property. The use of this tool gives priority to the protection of the public.\nImplementation Measures and Challenges \nIn \nB.C. the Community Charter\n and Local Government Act\n authorizes the local government building \n\ninspectors to withhold the issuance of a Building Permit unless a quali˜ed professional can provide a report \ncertifying the land can be used safely for the intended purpose. Unfortunately, there are a limited number \nof quali˜ed professionals for this specialized work. One challenge cited mainly by smaller and more remote \nmunicipalities is a lack of knowledge as to who is quali˜ed to undertake this specialized work and whether \nthe conclusions arrived at are appropriate. In some smaller communities, local government has chosen not \nto undertake a building inspection function and so in these areas, this tool cannot be used.\nAdvantages\nDisadvantages\nThe key advantage of this tool is its ability to place \nrestrictions on building construction until the hazard risk \n\nhas been addressed. \nThis tool enables site speci˜c measures to be \nincorporated as an integral part of the construction \n of a building.\nAn indirect advantage of this tool is its ability to prevent \nthe transfer of risk from one property owner to another \n\nunknowing purchaser. Registration of a covenant on title \nensures that any future owner or prospective purchaser \n is aware of the site-speci˜c building requirements. (B.C.)\nThe application of this tool comes late in the \n\ndevelopment process. This can be a concern if a property \n\nowner is not aware of any potential risk and only ˜nds out \nwhen a building permit application is submitted.\nLocal governments may not have the technical resources \n to give guidance in determining the minimum elevation \nfor safe building construction (i.e., Flood Construction \n\nLevel). This is a signi˜cant concern for local government \no˝cials with limited resources.\nReliance on a quali˜ed professional introduces the risk \nof retaining a person who lacks the necessary skills. \n\nIn B.C. the Association of Professional Engineers and \n\nGeoscientists are addressing this risk by preparing \n\nguidelines for quali˜ed professionals working to \nmitigate ˛ood risks and adapt to sea level rise.\nWhere building regulation or enforcement has not been \nadopted as a local government function, this tool will not \n be available. \n', '50Land Use Change or Restriction Tools\n1. Land Acquisition\nTool Description\nLocal governments can gain ownership of land for the primary purpose of addressing public safety through \npurchase or expropriation. Land can be acquired for a variety of purposes, including structural protection \nworks (i.e., a dike or other hard protection), vehicular access or setbacks for public safety. Land can also be \nacquired to prevent the development or to hold it in public ownership for exclusive public use. \nApplication\nLand can be acquired to accommodate a new dike, for the landward expansion of an existing dike or as the \n\nland base needed for other forms of structural protection.  \nLand acquisition can be used to provide public open space, protect rare or endangered habitat or create \nan ecological reserve. It can also be used to avoid the cost of servicing land at risk due to sea level rise. \nLand purchase may take place to prevent the development of land subject to hazards, however if land is \n\nrequired for a public purpose, government cannot simply downzone land for exclusive public use without \ncompensating the owner. \nExpropriation is perceived as an option of last resort, as an independent third party or the courts are the \n˜nal determinants of the land value. Expropriation may also be referred to as a compulsory acquisition, \n\ncompulsory purchase or eminent domain.\nEnabling Legislation\nA municipality is authorized to expropriate property in accordance with the \nExpropriation Act\n under  \nSection 31 of the\n Community Charter\n. Similar provisions to acquire or expropriate land exist in Atlantic \nCanada.\nEvaluation and Governance Considerations\nEconomic\n Œ Land acquisition is potentially expensive and there are ongoing costs and liability associated \nwith ownership. Any tax revenue generated from the land is forgone once it transfers to local government \n\nownership.\nEnvironmental\n Œ This tool can be used to protect environmentally sensitive land where development is not \nadvisable or for foreshore protection such as soft armouring. Land acquisition may also be used to provide for \n\npublic open space purposes subject to restrictions on improvements and the timing and extent of activities.\nSocial\n Œ There are social considerations and impacts associated with the acquisition of private land to \nprotect the public interest. Local governments may have to acquire large sections of land necessary to \n\nexpand a linear corridor (e.g. dike or seawall). Social bene˜ts may include the acquisition of public open \nspace and public access along a dike. In communities where expropriation is used, there may be negative \nimpacts to local landowners.\n', '51Implementation Measures and Challenges\nKey challenges in the acquisition of land include obtaining the necessary funds for a land purchase, \nagreeing on fair market value and obtaining political support for land expropriation. Land expropriation \nis typically undertaken by a local government but may include a provincial government agency. Strategic \nor O˝cial Community Plans may identify properties needed for future land acquisition and, if so, make \nprovisions for funding these acquisitions. \nExample of Land Acquisition from Bas-Saint-Laurent, Quebec\nIn 2010 in the Bas-Saint-Laurent of Quebec, 100 homes were destroyed due to a storm event which \neroded seven metres of shoreline. In response, the Province of Quebec o˚ered to compensate \nhomeowners for relocation, and the properties were then o˚ered for sale to the municipality for $1.00. \n\nThe role of the Province in this case allowed the municipality to acquire the land at risk and gain control \nof it to prevent future development. \nAdvantages\nDisadvantages\nAn important tool for implementing linear protection \nmeasures (e.g. dikes) where existing land ownership \n\nboundaries do not allow a cost e˚ective con˜guration \n for shoreline management. \nLand purchase may be used in combination with other \ntools to reduce the cost of ˛ood protection (e.g., dike \n\nvs. seawall). This will require a comparative analysis of \n\noptions that includes the cost of land and structural tools.\nWhere necessary, expropriation enables property \nacquisition if a voluntary purchase is not possible.\nLand purchase may also be the preferred outcome of \na cost-bene˜t analysis where other options are more \n\nexpensive. \nLand purchase can be a key element in a managed \n retreat strategy.\nThis tool is primarily used to protect urban development \n\nand may include the high costs of acquiring and \n\ndemolishing existing building improvements. \nLand acquisition involves the use of scarce ˜nancial \nresources. Both local and senior governments may be \nreluctant to set aside funds for land acquisition unless \n\nthis is part of a capital improvement project. \nExpropriation has the disadvantage that price is not \ncontrolled by the acquiring agency. \nExpropriation is typically seen as an option of last resort \nand is not typically viewed favourably by the general \npublic or land owners.\nThe availability of land o˚ered for public acquisition often \nhas a short window of opportunity following the decision \n\nof an owner to sell the land or the death of an owner.\n2. Transfer of Development Potential\nTool Description\nThis tool refers to the transfer of a property™s development potential under current zoning provisions from \none site or property to another. If a parcel is considered at risk, the ﬁas of rightﬂ development potential can \nbe relocated to another area of land or parcel not at risk. \nDensity transfer is primarily a voluntary, market-based concept in which the transfer of development \npotential o˚ers protection for sensitive coastal resources and removes it from hazard areas. The tool can \n\ndirect development away from the area at risk by designating the ﬁdonorﬂ or ﬁsendingﬂ area and allocating \n it to an appropriate ﬁreceivingﬂ area where development or increased density can be safely accommodated. \n', '52Application\nThis tool is utilized in association with zoning where the development potential is measurable (e.g. the \nnumber of dwellings units or ˛oor space ratio). Density transfer could apply to any land use but is typically \napplied to residential uses. The development potential of the ﬁsendingﬂ site is reduced and the density of \nthe ﬁreceivingﬂ site is increased. An O˝cial Community Plan or other similar policy document is needed to \ndetermine both areas at risk and areas where additional density is deemed suitable. \nDensity transfer may be achieved using a ﬁdensity bankﬂ in which a speci˜c density is removed from the \nﬁsendingﬂ site without the need to identify a ﬁreceivingﬂ site. Density transfer relies on an administrative \nprocess to regulate exchanges and a market to determine value. Density transfer could be applied in any \nmunicipality and would be best used in conjunction with a strategic plan where managed retreat is an \nobjective.\nEnabling Legislation\nThe transfer of development potential can occur within the normal powers of zoning. Its application in \n\nCanada has mainly been for heritage conservation purposes but it could be used as a tool for adaptation \nto sea level rise. \nEvaluation and Governance Considerations\nEconomic\n Œ This tool essentially assigns an economic value to a property™s development potential. The \ndevelopment potential of areas at risk are then restricted and the value transferred to areas suitable for \n\nincreased density. A market-based mechanism is used to determine the value of the density transfer. \nEnvironmental\n Œ The successful implementation of this tool could protect sensitive coastal areas at \nrisk from development activity. Limited development could lead to the expansion of environmentally \n\nsensitive habitat, allowing intertidal habitats to expand where otherwise they might be reduced due \n to coastal squeeze.\nSocial\n Œ The primary use of this tool would be to reduce the development or redevelopment potential \n of land in areas at risk due to sea level rise.\nImplementation Measures and Challenges \nImplementation requires both an administrative process and a market that provides an incentive to \ndevelopers. Although largely a market-based tool, it requires organization and administrative support \n from the local government.\nTransfer of development potential has received considerable interest in planning literature, particularly \nin the U.S.A. where the concept is referred to as ﬁtransfer of development rights.ﬂ However, the successful \n\nimplementation of the concept has been very limited, as it poses challenges in terms of equity and \nadministration for owners of both donor and receiving sites and does not have particularly wide appeal to \nproperty developers. As an example, the City of Vancouver used a density transfer system for many years \n \n be used, leading to a moratorium on density banking.\n', '53Advantages\nDisadvantages\nAlthough not currently widely used, this tool is within a \nlocal government™s zoning authority.\nThis tool is market-based and could be structured so local \ngovernment requirements are limited to administrative \ncosts.\nTransfer of density potential could be combined with \nland acquisition in which the local government acquires \n\nownership of the land and transfers the development \n\npotential to the former owner elsewhere in the same \nmunicipality.\nDensity transfer may provide a less costly alternative \nto land acquisition (whether voluntary or through \n\nexpropriation). \nThis tool depends upon the assumption that every parcel \n\nof land has development potential that can be quanti˜ed \n\nand transferred to an alternative location. \nDensity transfer has limited potential for small \ncommunities or ones with a static or declining \npopulation.\nOwners of coastal properties may resent land use \nrestrictions or ﬁdown-zoningﬂ if they perceive no \n\nimminent risk.\nAs a voluntary undertaking, the transfer of development \npotential may not prevent the development of areas at \nrisk from coastal hazards.\n3. Easements and Covenants\nTool Description\nAn easement is a legal agreement in which one landowner grants the use of some real property rights to \nanother for a speci˜c purpose. It represents an interest in land but not the right of exclusive possession. \nIt can be used to allow access over, use of or other limitation that bene˜ts one piece of land (known as \nthe dominant tenement) and burdens another (known as the servient tenement) without resulting in a \nchange of ownership. In B.C., a statutory right-of-way is similar to an easement. This B.C. variation is used \nto avoid the need for two properties, one with a dominant and the other with a servient tenement. The use \nof a statutory right of way is restricted to a government body, Crown Corporation or similar entity. Both \ncovenants and easements ﬁrun with the landﬂ, meaning they bind current as well as future owners.\n88A covenant can be used to restrict the use of land for a particular purpose. In B.C. and P.E.I., a covenant can \n\nalso be of a positive or negative nature requiring an undertaking by a landowner. Examples of positive \nundertakings would be requirements to plant trees or to maintain privately owned ˛ood protection works. \nRestrictive or negative requirements would include a limitation on development for ˛ood protection \npurposes or prevention of the use of ˜ll. \nIn Quebec, the Civil Code of Quebec makes provision for servitudes. A servitude is a charge on one parcel \nof land for the bene˜t of another. A servitude closely corresponds to an easement. Each of these legal \ninstruments can be used to restrict part or all of a property for a particular purpose without the need for \n a change of ownership.\n89 Application\n\nhowever, the agreement of the property owner is required. Easements are commonly used to provide \nthe right of access through a property. A statutory right-of-way is similar but involves a public body. Both \ntypically involve a legal survey or explanatory plan registered as a charge on the property title. \nA covenant is a written agreement between two or more parties to limit the use of the land in a particular \nway or require the land be used in a particular way. For an easement, statutory right-of-way or covenant \n to be enforceable, a purchaser of property must be given noti˜cation of its existence. The purchaser is \n88 (Richardson and Otero 2012)\n89 For a more detailed discussion, see Conservation Easements, Covenants and Servitudes in Canada A Legal Review, Report No. 04-1, \n North American Wetlands Conservation Council (Canada). \n', '54deemed to have notice if the legal instrument is registered on the certi˜cate of title of the property in the \napplicable provincial land registry. It remains on the land and is automatically transferred from one owner \nto another if the land is sold. \nEnabling Legislation\nIn common law jurisdictions in Canada (every province but Quebec), easements and covenants are authorized \nby either common law or statute. In Quebec, the Civil Code of Quebec makes provision for servitudes.\n90In B.C., an easement, statutory right-of-way and/or covenant may be registered as a charge on the title \n\nof land under Division 4 (S.218-223) of the Land Title Act\n. These tools can have broad applications in \naddressing coastal hazards. For example a covenant can include provisions restricting the use of land \nor provisions limiting or preventing building on the land, or preventing its subdivision. The \nAct\n speci˜es that such a covenant may be of a negative or positive nature and may include a provision that land be \n\nprotected, preserved, conserved, maintained, enhanced, restored or kept in its natural or existing state \n in accordance with the covenant and to the extent provided in the covenant. \nIn Quebec the \nNatural Heritage Conservation Act\n allows the registration of a nature reserve agreement \nto be registered against a land title. More speci˜cally, the purpose of this \nAct\n is to contribute to the \nobjective of safeguarding the character, diversity and integrity of Quebec™s natural heritage through \n\nmeasures intended to protect its biological diversity and the life-sustaining elements of natural settings. \nThe \nAct\n is intended to facilitate the establishment of a network of protected areas representative of \nbiodiversity by introducing protection measures for natural settings that complete existing measures, \nincluding the assigning of protection status to certain areas under the responsibility of other \ngovernment departments or bodies.\nIn New Brunswick, under the \nConservation Easements Act\n, a municipality or any agency of a municipality \nmay hold a conservation easement for a variety of reasons such as: the protection, enhancement or \n\n \nNova Scotia follows the 2001 \nConservation Easement Act\n which enables a conservation easement to be \nentered into between an owner and an eligible body for the purpose of protecting, restoring or enhancing \nland that: contains natural ecosystems or constitutes the habitat of rare, threatened or endangered plant \n\n\necosystems, landforms or landscapes of the province.\nThe \nNatural Areas Protection Act of P.E.I.\n is intended to preserve natural areas. Under this \nAct\n, a private \nlandowner may impose a restrictive covenant on his or her land by entering into an agreement with a \ncovenant holder. Such a restrictive covenant may be positive or negative in nature and prohibit speci˜c uses \nof the land. ﬁNatural areasﬂ are de˜ned by the \nAct\n and include parcels of land that: provide haven for seasonal \n\n\naspects of the natural environment.\nNewfoundland and Labrador has no speci˜c conservation easement legislation. However, the \nHistoric \nResources Act\n authorizes covenants or easements for the protection of historic resources. The \nAct™s\n de˜nition of \nﬁhistoric resourcesﬂ is broad enough to cover some lands with conservation values.\n91 The \nAct\n de˜nes ﬁhistoric \nresourcesﬂ as a work of nature or of humans that is primarily of value for its archaeological, prehistoric, historic, \ncultural, natural, scienti˜c or aesthetic interest, including an archaeological, prehistoric, historic or natural site, \nstructure or object.\n90 (Atkins, Hillyer and Kwasniak 2004)\n91 (Atkins, Hillyer and Kwasniak 2004)\n', '55Evaluation and Governance Considerations\nEconomic\n Œ Economic considerations can include the cost of restricting land use to reduce the risk of \ndamage to land or buildings. A Save Harmless provision in a covenant can be used to protect a local \ngovernment from ˜nancial damages in the event of future ˛ooding. The cost of an easement or statutory \nright-of-way will vary depending on the applicable conditions Œ an appraisal is frequently used to \ndetermine fair market value. Compensation to the owner could be through a lump sum or an annual \npayment based on a percentage of market value. A local government may be able to issue a tax receipt \n for a conservation easement if it is classi˜ed as a charitable gift by the Canada Revenue Agency.\nEnvironmental\n Œ This tool is well suited to conservation purposes. Part or all of the land may be restricted \nfor habitat conservation and a covenant may also be used as means of requiring an undertaking for \n\nenvironment enhancement purposes.\nSocial\n Œ Using this tool provides an alternative to land acquisition that meets the needs both of the \nlandowner and the local government. This could include limited development or no development on land \n\nsubject to coastal hazards, but not necessarily restriction of the whole parcel. This tool o˚ers ˛exibility \nwithout a change in ownership or subdivision.\nImplementation Measures and Challenges \nImplementation measures include approval by the local government of the easement or other land use \n\nrestriction and may include the services of a lawyer, appraiser and legal surveyor. Challenges may include \nsecuring an agreement with the land owner as to the nature, value and funding of the restriction.\nAdvantages\nDisadvantages\nThe easement or other restriction can be limited to a \nparticular part of a site, a particular purpose or a speci˜c \n\ntime period. \nThe owner is able to retain ownership of the property \n and may be able to use areas not at risk. \nThe cost for a covenant or statutory right-of-way is \ntypically much less than fee simple acquisition.\nA covenant may be used in conjunction with other tools \nsuch as subdivision, building or land use regulation. \nA conservation easement may be considered a charitable \ngift by the Canada Revenue Agency.\nA covenant may be negotiated as part of the \ndevelopment approval process with no direct cost to \n the local government.\nAnnual compensation or a lump sum payment may be \n\nrequired to secure the easement or statutory right of \n \nway process or servitude.\n4. Land Trusts\nTool Description\nA land trust is a non-pro˜t private organization created for the purpose of environmental conservation or \nother similar purpose. While there are many land trust organizations in Canada, their general objective is \n to acquire ecologically signi˜cant, often threatened, land through purchase, donation, covenant or lease. \nLand trusts consist of nationally or provincially based organizations, typically non-pro˜t societies with the \nability to o˚er tax deductible charitable receipts. National organizations include Ducks Unlimited Canada \n\nand the Nature Conservancy of Canada. Provincial organizations include the Nature Conservancy of British \n', '56Columbia, Land Trust Alliance of B.C., The Land Conservancy (TLC) of B.C., Nature Action Quebec, the Nature \nTrust of New Brunswick, the Island Trust in P.E.I, and the Nova Scotia Nature Trust.\nApplication\nLand trusts work with individual donors, foundations, corporations, and all levels of government to acquire \n\nand maintain land for environmental conservation purposes. Land trusts may work in a variety of ways to \n\nfundraising to acquire land to prevent the loss of environmentally signi˜cant values, and managing land in \npublic ownership to protect and enhance its habitat and other environmental characteristics. \nA conservation agreement is central to land trusts. While this does not speci˜cally refer to adaptation to sea \nlevel rise, the conservation objectives of existing land trusts can easily accommodate this aspect, particularly \nwith habitat creation or enhancements such as coastal wetland and sand dune creation, or rehabilitation.\nEvaluation and Governance Considerations\nEconomic\n Œ The cost of land acquisition as well as the cost of restoration and maintenance would likely \nbe borne by the land trust organization. Local government could facilitate involvement of a land trust \nwithout necessarily expending ˜nancial resources and achieve the objective of protecting people from \ncoastal hazards.\nEnvironmental\n Œ This tool is well suited to acquire and protect environmentally sensitive land without local \ngovernment having to take on responsibility for the land itself. \nSocial\n Œ This tool can either restrict or enhance public access to environmentally sensitive land or habitat \nrehabilitation areas. In addition, this tool potentially has wider appeal for application by those wishing to \nconserve environmentally sensitive areas in perpetuity.\nImplementation Measures and Challenges \nThe implementation of this tool can include acquiring land by a land trust through fundraising, eco-gift, or \ngovernment transfer, preparing a conservation agreement, and undertaking the necessary restoration and \nmaintenance of the land once an easement, covenant or other restriction is in place. Challenges include \nobtaining the resources to acquire, restore, and manage environmentally signi˜cant lands. Time constraints \nmay also apply.\nEnglishman River Estuary on \nVancouver Island, \nB.C. 76.7 Hectare \nAcquisition by the \nNature Trust of B.C. \n (Photo: Nature \n\nTrust of B.C.)\n', '57Advantages\nDisadvantages\nLand trusts are primarily used for environmental \nprotection and enhancement. \nMany donors are more receptive to private stewardship of \nenvironmentally sensitive land than to donating the land \nto government. \nMany land trusts have an extensive and exemplary record \nof environmental stewardship. \nFundraising for privately managed land acquisition by a \nland trust o˚ers opportunities that may not be available if \n\ngovernment is involved.\nLocal governments can work collaboratively with \nland trusts to identify areas that may be suited to \nenvironmental protection and play a facilitation role but \n\nleave the negotiation with the land owner up to the trust.\nThe cost of land acquisition may limit the ability of a land \n\ntrust to secure and restore environmentally signi˜cant \n\nland. \nThe appeal of land acquisitions varies greatly depending \non the type of environmentally signi˜cant land and the \ncost of maintaining or restoring the land.\n5. Foreshore Tenure\nTool Description\nA foreshore tenure is a legal instrument that authorizes a use or uses over intertidal and subtidal areas. \nThis may include a lease or licence of occupation. In B.C., the foreshore generally refers to the area below \nthe natural boundary.\n92 In Atlantic Canada, the foreshore refers to the area below the high water mark. A \nforeshore tenure by itself will not provide protection from coastal hazards. However, it may, in conjunction \n\nwith zoning, provide the mechanism to enable a more comprehensive approach to shoreline management. \nApplication\nA foreshore tenure could be applied to almost all of Canada™s southern coasts. Foreshore tenure is generally \ngranted by the applicable provincial government, although there are some exceptions, most notably \nwith respect to harbours established under the \nCanadian Marine Act\n. Foreshore tenure does not a˚ect the \nunderlying Crown ownership of land (including land under water) but it can be used by a local government \nas part of a comprehensive approach to shoreline management such as beach nourishment, sand dune or \ncoastal wetland creation and/or rehabilitation as well as hard structural protection.\nA foreshore lease is one form of tenure. In B.C. foreshore leases require a legal survey to de˜ne the tenure \narea and are typically issued for periods of 10 to 30 years. The term ﬁwater lotﬂ is frequently used as an \nalternative. If the lease is surveyed and has a term of 5 or more years, it can be registered in the Land Title \nO˝ce. A licence of occupation may be used if the term is short, where minimal improvements are proposed \nor for remote sites where survey costs may be prohibitive. A statutory right of way may also be used to \naccommodate a linear corridor within a foreshore area. \nThe issuance of a foreshore lease is typically by application to the provincial government or another agency \nwith jurisdiction. The interests of riparian owners and First Nations must usually be considered and the \nlease must be consistent with zoning by local government or other applicable authorities. \nIn a few instances, a municipality has partnered with the Crown to take over the administration and \nmanagement of foreshore areas. An example is a head lease.  Under this arrangement, the municipality is \ngranted long-term tenure over a foreshore area with a revenue-sharing arrangement with the Crown. In \n92 In B.C., the ﬁnatural boundaryﬂ is de˜ned in the \nLand Act\n as, ﬁthe visible high water mark of any lake, river, stream or other body of water \nwhere the presence and action of the water are so common and usual, and so long continued in all ordinary years, as to mark on the soil \n\nof the bed of the body of water a character distinct from that of its banks, in vegetation, as well as in the nature of the soil itself.ﬂ\n', '58return the head lease transfers responsibility for management and environment issues to the municipality.  \nHead leases are not commonly issued to municipalities unless there is demonstrated business case with a \nhigh bene˜t to the Province.\nExample of Foreshore Tenure from West Vancouver head lease, B.C. \nSince 1974, the District of West Vancouver has held a head lease with the Province of B.C. for the \nmanagement of land covered by water from the high water mark extending 1,000 m into Burrard Inlet. \nOnly the foreshore areas controlled by the Vancouver Port Authority and the B.C. Ferries Terminal in \nHorseshoe Bay are excluded. As a result of this partnership, a new 30 year head lease will commence \n in 2014. The lease covers any community purposes under the \nCommunity and Institutional Crown land policy\n. This includes public access infrastructure such as walkways, seawalls, boat ramps, piers, wharves, and \n˜ve marinas. Utility works are included, as well as natural enhancements such as groynes, rock reefs \nand riprap. The lease authorizes subleases and includes a revenue sharing agreement with the Province \nof B.C., while the District of West Vancouver assumes management responsibility and liability under \nthe head lease. The head lease is subject to the rights of riparian owners or occupiers of adjoining land. \nThe District also has adopted \nO˜cial Community Plan\n policies to protect the foreshore and a 5 year \n\nforeshore protection plan. A number of enhancement works are currently underway with the active \nsupport of a˚ected riparian owners.\nEnabling Legislation\nIn B.C. foreshore leases and licences of occupation are typically granted by the Province under the \nLand Act\n. The \nLocal Government Act\n provides for local government regulation over the surface of the foreshore area \nthrough O˝cial Community Plans and zoning authority. \nThe province of Nova Scotia has a \nBeaches and Foreshores Act\n which allows for grants or leases of any tidal \n˛at, beach or foreshore. The N.S. Department of Natural Resources issues leases on submerged crown lands \n\nfor commercial purposes such as wharves, marinas, power generation, utility cables, etc. \nIn Newfoundland and Labrador, the \nLands Act\n, Section 7, provides for a reservation of shoreline on Crown \nlands that border a lake, pond, river, the seashore or foreshore, and that are granted, leased or licensed to \nanother party, that a 15 metre wide strip of land is maintained as a reserve by the province. The \nLands Act\n of \n\nNewfoundland and Labrador also gives authority to the provincial government to issue leases on foreshore \nareas for aquaculture licensing. \nOn P.E.I., water lots in waterfront areas can be privately owned. The Department of Fisheries and Oceans \nadministers the licensing and leasing of aquaculture operations via the \nFisheries Act\n. The in˜lling of \n\nharbours, such as a project in Summerside in 2002, requires federal approval under subsection 35 of the \nFederal Fisheries Act\n.New Brunswick has had the authority under \nCommon Law\n to issue foreshore leases or grants for oyster \n˜shing, for up to a 10 year period, since 1866.\n', '59Evaluation and Governance Considerations\nEconomic\n Œ In B.C., the cost of a foreshore lease is set by the Province. The assessed or market value of a \nlease may be set at a percentage of the land value, for example 8% annually. Nominal rent tenure applies \nif the lease quali˜es under the Community and Institutional Land Use Policy of the Ministry of Forests, \nLands, and Natural Resource Operations. This policy applies to eligible public sector organizations, local \ngovernments, First Nations and community organizations.\nEnvironmental\n Œ A foreshore lease allows the management of the foreshore to be treated as more of a \ncomplete system rather than stopping at the traditional jurisdictional boundary of the high tide mark \n\nor natural boundary. This can facilitate implementation of innovative soft armoring approaches such \nas habitat enhancement of intertidal areas, beach nourishment or the creation of wetlands. In B.C. the \nholder of a foreshore tenure is responsible for clean-up of any contamination that occurs within the \ntenure boundaries.\nSocial\n Œ Local governance tenure over the foreshore can allow for partnerships with riparian owners and \nlocal community groups to provide protection for upland areas or intertidal habitats. This can help foster \na sense of ownership and responsibility at the community level for adaptation along the coast. Increased \nrecreational use may provide an additional indirect bene˜t. \nImplementation Measures and Challenges \nIn British Columbia, foreshore leases have typically been used for marine facilities associated with upland \n\ndevelopment. One challenge will be to refocus this tool as part of a sea level rise adaptation strategy. \nIn addition, it must be recognized that this tool will have limited suitability due to environmental, \nbathymetric and other constraints.\nThe District of West Vancouver provides an excellent model for foreshore management. The District has \nworked in co-operation with upland owners and has not detrimentally a˚ected ˜sh habitat. In addition, \nforeshore leases do not a˚ect any federally controlled waterways such as shipping channels for the Port \nof Vancouver or BC Ferries routes.\nWest Vancouver, B.C. Seawall\n', '60Advantages\nDisadvantages\nForeshore tenure could enable a local government to \nundertake a broader range of shoreline management \n \nand adaptation measures in response to coastal hazards.\nA foreshore lease (or other form of tenure) could enable \nenvironmental enhancement to occur with less reliance \non structural protection. Possible applications include \n\nbeach nourishment or the creation of o˚-shore islands \n\nand sand dunes.\nA foreshore lease does not absolve the holder of any \n\nresponsibility under the \nFisheries Act\n or Navigable Waters \nProtection Act\n.There will be costs associated with a foreshore lease, \n\nwhich could range from a nominal cost to fair market \n\nvalue (prepaid or annual lease payment).\nThe applicability of this tool will be limited to areas with \nsuitable shoreline conditions and bathymetry.\n', '61Structural (Flood Protection Works)\n1. Scour Protection\nTool Description\nScour protection is a property-speci˜c structural tool used to protect shoreline structures or building \nfoundations from being eroded or undermined due to the e˚ects of moving water. Scour protection \nconsists of riprap or structural elements designed to withstand wave action and the force of moving water. \nIt can take di˚erent forms depending on the application: a scour apron refers to site-speci˜c protection \naround the base of a building or structure whereas a scour blanket refers to measures to protect a covered \nor partially covered asset such as a pipeline, outfall or underground utility from damage by ˛oodwater. \nApplication\nScour protection is typically applied to the foundation of a building or structure and is often used in \n\nconjunction with structural elevation. In this case the scour protection would be implemented around the \nbuilding or structural element foundation. Other commonly used applications include protecting the base \nof transmission towers, bridge foundations, seawalls, and along coastal corridors containing a highway, \nrailway or pipeline. Scour protection can be an integral part of a shoreline protection system such as \narmour rock, gabions, concrete slabs, and similar systems.\nEvaluation and Governance Considerations\nEconomic\n Œ There are costs associated with erosion protection measures. A scour apron, typically includes \nan apron of riprap outside the perimeter wall installed down to the depth of the potential scour around the \nsite. The surface may include a gravel topping or ˜lter fabric as well as topsoil for landscaping. Other scour \nprotection may take the form of pile foundations designed to derive vertical and lateral support below the \ndepth of scour. Pile foundations are more expensive than conventional spread foundations, but they are \nnot common for single storey residential structures.\nA scour apron may be used to support retaining walls of linear infrastructure (e.g. dikes) to ensure the toe \n of the structure is protected. For a submerged structure such as a pipeline, a scour blanket typically consists \nof an armouring of ˜lter stone around the structure and a cover stone above it.\nEnvironmental\n Œ Scour protection primarily addresses the protection of building foundations and linear \nstructure foundations. Environmental impacts will be limited for buildings, but may increase in magnitude \n\nwhere scour protection is introduced along a linear corridor such a seawall, stormwater outfall or a pipeline \ncrossing. Intertidal areas are typically associated with high environmental values, and protective measures \nmay result in some reduction or loss of environmental quality.\nSocial\n Œ This tool is intended to minimize risk to the foundations of buildings and structures. If the risk to a \nbuilding is reduced, the risk to inhabitants and employees also decreases. \n', '62Implementation Measures and Challenges \nImplementation typically occurs following an engineering analysis of risk and appropriate mitigation measures. \nA design drawing is produced, showing the minimum requirements to implement the erosion/scour protection \nmeasures. The contractor or other responsible party then constructs the scour protection according to the \nspeci˜cations provided. The tool may be implemented in conjunction with other requirements as determined \nby a building inspector, approving o˝cer or the terms set within a covenant on title.\nChallenges can occur if the extent of the risk increases over time or is not known or identi˜ed, with the \nresult that scour protection measures are not requested. If there are no gatekeepers responsible for public \nprotection, the risk to a speci˜c building or infrastructure corridor may be overlooked even if the property \nowner is conscientious. In the absence of regulatory requirements or regular inspection, information \nresources can provide general guidelines alerting a property owner to the bene˜ts of scour protection in \nareas subject to ˛ooding and sea level rise.\nAdvantages\nDisadvantages\nProvide a barrier to protect the foundation of a building \nor other structure from wave action or other form of \n\nrapidly moving water. \nThe presence of erosion/scour protection provides two \nsecondary messages:\n\n\n\nAesthetic disadvantages include the often harsh \n\nappearance of the erosion/scour protection. This can \n\noften be mitigated by providing an erodible top to cover \nthe scour protection or provide a more gradual grade \naway from the building. \nWhere services are provided to a building, the erosion/\nscour protection will only protect services within the \n\nscour protection area, not the services beyond.\nCosts can be signi˜cant and include designing, \ntransporting, installing and maintaining erosion/scour \nprotection. \n2. Structural Elevation\nTool Description\nStructural elevation can be achieved in several ways, including: raising the ground elevation with the \n\nbuilding by using stilts, foundation walls or similar elevating structures. This tool is mainly used for new \nconstruction but can also apply to a major addition or retro˜t. This tool is also sometimes referred to as \nsuper elevation or dry ˛oodproo˜ng.\nApplication\nThis tool can reduce the risk of damage to buildings and infrastructure by raising their elevation. The \nincrease in elevation above the natural ground level can be determined through a risk assessment by a \nquali˜ed professional or in accordance with local government requirements, guidelines or policy. In rural \nareas, this tool typically involves the use of ˜ll to raise the elevation of a house or other buildings above a \n˛ood plain or other ˛ood hazard. In urban areas where lot areas are smaller, this tool may involve creating \nnon-habitable space (crawl space or cellar) in areas subject to ˛ooding. A combination of ˜ll and building \ndesign changes may be used for new development on a neighbourhood level or for in˜ll redevelopment \nwithin an existing area. \n', '63In B.C., the authority for structural elevation is most clearly stated in Section 910 of the \nLocal Government \nAct\n. If a local government considers that ˛ooding may occur on a piece of land, the local government may \nadopt a bylaw requiring a minimum elevation for the underside of a ˛oor system of a house on that land. \n\nSuch a bylaw must consider the provincial guidelines, which take sea level rise and related impacts \n into account.\nThe standard of protection varies from province to province. In British Columbia, the design standard of \nprotection is for a 1 in 200 year return period. This means the elevation of buildings should be raised to \nwithstand a ˛ood with an annual probability of 0.5% or a 1 in 200 year ˛ood. In B.C. the minimum elevation \nfor habitable construction is called the Flood Construction Level (FCL). This is the minimum elevation of \nthe underside of a wooden ˛oor system or the top of a concrete slab for habitable buildings. The Flood \nConstruction Level typically includes an additional vertical distance (freeboard) of 0.3 metres to 0.6 metres \nto the calculated ˛ood level to accommodate uncertainties in ˛ood levels. There is a relationship between \n\nthe standard of protection and resulting risk. If the design standard is reduced to withstand a ˛ood with \n an annual probability of 1.0%, the cost of protective measures will decrease but the risk increases.\nFlood construction requirements in Atlantic Canada may reference a minimum elevation above sea level \ndatum, geodetic datum or protection for a 1 in 100 year return period or a 50 year design standard. In \n\nNewfoundland and Labrador, the design standard is based on a ˛ood event with a 1 in 100 year return \nperiod. The other Atlantic Provinces rely on generally accepted coastal engineering design standards for the \nlife of structures in coastal areas of 50 years. A notable exception is the Confederation Bridge between New \nBrunswick and Prince Edward Island, which was built a metre higher to account for sea level rise over the 100 \nyear design life of the project.\nEvaluation and Governance Considerations\nEconomic\n Œ The cost of structural elevation depends on a numbers of factors, one of which is the cost of \n˜ll. The a˚ected site area will include the building footprint area plus a sloped area for the ˜ll, typically at \na 3:1˙slope, to return to the natural ground level. Alternatively, a retaining wall or other structure could be \nused to reduce or eliminate the sloped area. The amount of ˜ll could be substantial. For a 1 metre elevation \nrise to accommodate a two storey building with 200 m² of living area and a building footprint of 10 metres \nby 10 metres plus a 3:1 slope back to the natural elevation, nearly 200 m² of ˜ll would be required. For a \n2 metre elevation rise, the amount of ˜ll would increase to over 500 m². If a lesser amount of ˜ll is used \nwithout reducing the Flood Construction Level, the building could be designed without livable space on \n\nthe ground level. This often takes the form of a crawl space with a low ceiling height, a garage, an entry \nfoyer, laundry room or a small storage area. Electrical outlets would have to be raised and a furnace located \nabove the Flood Construction Level.\nThe key economic consideration is the cost of reducing the risk through structural elevation. The cost of \nproviding public infrastructure\n93 (roads, bridges) in an area at risk is another economic consideration that \nwill increase over time. The cost of ˛oodproo˜ng can also be compared to the cost of development in an \narea without risk of coastal ˛ooding or inundation.\nEnvironmental\n Œ This tool primarily addresses the protection of buildings and property.  Environmental \nimpacts will be more signi˜cant where a large area is subject to ˜ll placement, such as previously \n\nundeveloped areas, wetlands and other natural areas. The cost of ˛oodproo˜ng can also be compared \n to the cost of development in an area without risk of coastal ˛ooding or inundation.\n93 Critical infrastructure includes all the services that support development in an area subject to the risk of ˛ooding.\n', '64Social\n Œ This tool primarily minimises risk to building inhabitants and structures themselves. Social \nconsiderations include the visual impact, which increases as the amount of structural elevation increases. \nFor a single family dwelling or townhouse, there is a risk the owner may convert a crawl space or non-\nhabitable space below the Flood Construction Level to a living area after building occupancy has been \nobtained. This is most likely to occur where the cost of housing is high.\nImplementation Measures and Challenges \nStructural elevation measures are typically required as a condition of building approval. Structural elevation \nmeasures can be implemented after a building is constructed but incur greater costs. The challenges increase \ndepending on the amount of elevation rise required and the site. A large structural elevation rise on a small \nproperty may not be feasible. The aesthetics of having elevated and non-elevated structures in the same \ncommunity may be a drawback if the elevation change is signi˜cant. \nProviding access for persons with disabilities poses an additional challenge. The structural elevation of \nheritage buildings also poses a particular challenge.\nAdvantages\nDisadvantages\nBy raising the habitable ˛oor elevation to a speci˜ed \ndesign ˛ood event, the risk of ˛ood damage can be \n\nmeasurably reduced. \nStructural elevation enhances resilience by providing \n a secondary means of protection where dikes provide \n the ˜rst line of defence. \nOne indirect impact of structural elevation is greater \nawareness of sea level rise. Although architectural design \n\ncan address visual impact to some extent, a major change \nin elevation for a dwelling or other habitable structure \nserves as a vivid and constant public reminder that \n\n˛ooding is a risk that must be addressed. \nStructural elevation is not a permanent solution, as \n sea levels will continue to rise, but may last the lifetime \n \nof the building.\nThe cost associated with raising the elevation of \n\na building can be considerable. The cost will vary \n\ndepending on the size of the building ˛oor plate, the \nbuilding design and the amount of elevation rise to \nreach the design requirements. Estimated additional \n\nbuilding costs for new construction may range from 3% \n\nto 30%. Associated costs may include additional steps or \nhandicapped accessibility provisions.\nThere is a limit to the amount of structural elevation \nwhich can occur. As structural elevation requirements \n\nincrease (i.e., become higher), the increase in cost is \n\ngeometric, not arithmetic. \nThe placement of ˜ll to raise the ground level may not be \naesthetically attractive if the elevation change is large. \nThis is particularly evident on small in˜ll lots. \n3. Dikes\nTool Description\nA dike is commonly a linear compacted earth˜ll structure intended to protect a designated area from \ninundation caused by high water conditions on an adjacent watercourse or ˛oodplain.\n94 Dikes typically \nform the key defense element in a protect strategy. The primary function of a dike is to prevent the \ninundation of coastal lowlands from the sea under extreme conditions. Sea dikes typically have a ˛atter \ngradient on the seaward side, for the purpose of dissipating wave energy. This is not necessary on the \nlandward side where a steeper gradient is typical to reduce land requirements. In addition, a sea dike will \ntypically have toe scour protection consisting of riprap and an under layer of ˜lter rock or geotextile to \nprevent it from being undermined. \n94 (APEG Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of BC 2012)\n', '65It is important to recognize that, because agricultural land can tolerate some overtopping, the construction \nelevations and design of earthen dikes to protect agricultural land may be lower than for the protection of \nlife and property. Depending on the province and location, municipalities may have no control over private \nagricultural dikes within their boundaries. They are not ˜nancially responsible for repairs to such dikes but \nmay be a˚ected by the impacts of a dike breach.\nApplication\nRecent research,\n95 has resulted in a re-evaluation of the vulnerability of communities to ˛ooding due to \nstorm surges and wave action. In B.C., a 2012 study indicated the need for a higher dike crest elevation \n\nfor over 250˙km of shoreline in the Lower Mainland study area, most of which is protected by dikes. The \nincreased risk is due to a combination of sea level rise as well as an increased provision for storm surges \n and wave run-up and seismic considerations.\nDikes are typically designed by a quali˜ed professional in accordance with local and provincial \nregulations and guidelines. In B.C., there are various applicable provincial documents, including the \nrecent Climate Change Adaptation Guidelines for Sea Dikes and Coastal Flood Hazard Land Use,\n96 which \nare divided into three volumes: Draft Policy Discussion Paper, Sea Dike Guidelines and Guidelines for \nManagement of Coastal Flood Hazard Land Use. There are numerous technical publications which \nprovide guidance on engineering design.\nAssets protected by dikes can include infrastructure and agricultural lands. Both New Brunswick and \nNova Scotia have legislation to protect agricultural land and to create marsh bodies, although not all \ndevelopment that has taken place in low-lying areas is behind a dike or protected by this mandate. In \n New Brunswick, the legislation is referred to as the \nMarshland Reclamation Act\n (O.C. 82-14). Nova Scotia \nhas been more progressive, updating the \nMarshland Reclamation Act\n of 1989 with numerous amendments \nthrough the \nAgricultural Marshland Conservation Act\n (c.22, s.1, amended 2004). \nNew Brunswick has 37,000 acres of marshland protected from the tidal waters of the Bay of Fundy. Some \nof this land is protected by a variety of earthen infrastructure (including dikes) constructed over 300 years \nago. Much of the earthen infrastructure was constructed in the early 1950s and is currently maintained by \nthe N.B. Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Aquaculture.\n95 (Ausenco Sandwell 2011)\n96 (Ausenco Sandwell 2011)\n2011 Upgrade to Dike in Fraser \n\nRiver Estuary, Richmond, B.C. \n(Photo: City of Richmond)\n', '66In British Columbia approval to construct dikes and other hard protection must be obtained from the \nprovince under the \nWater Act\n and the Dike Maintenance Act\n and, where applicable, from the federal \ngovernment under the \nFisheries Act\n and the Environmental Assessment Act\n.The Nova Scotia Department of Agriculture has a mandate to protect agricultural land behind dikes in \nthe Annapolis Basin, Upper Bay of Fundy and other regions of the province. The Department is currently \n\nresponsible for tidal dike maintenance, while landowners are responsible for maintenance of internal dike \nroads and the acquisition of land required for the reconstruction of dikes. Historically, earthen dikes have \nbeen used to protect this land. These dikes have been raised to maintain a minimum critical elevation \nrelative to tide levels. Many dikes were originally built by the Acadians 300 years ago and were upgraded \nin the 1950s. In 2000, the provincial \nAgricultural Marshland Conservation Act\n was passed to protect these \nsoils for future generations. It is thought that a majority of the diked land is at risk from rising sea levels and \nstorm surge.\n97 Under a joint Atlantic Regional Adaptation Collaboration project with New Brunswick, a 2012 \nGIS assessment of dike vulnerability based on LiDAR data in the Tantramar marshlands area concluded \nthat the region was at immediate risk of ˛ooding.\n98 With an average height of 8.9 metres, the vast majority \nof dikes (89%) would be overtopped with a frequency of 1:10 years (i.e. once in 10 years). This would \n\npotentially ˛ood over 20% of Sackville during a storm surge.\nEvaluation and Governance Considerations\nEconomic\n Œ Economic considerations include: \n\n\n\n\n\nand road access for maintenance and emergency management purposes.\nWhere an increased dike height is involved, the economic, social and environmental implications of a \n\nseaward versus a landward expansion must be examined. Hard protection measures tend to be expensive \n(in the order of thousands of dollars per metre for revetments and dikes). The standard for ˛ood protection \nmeasures (i.e., Flood Construction Level for current sea level vs. projections for 2050 or 2100) will have \na critical impact on the economic costs. Given the cost implications, it is anticipated that greater use of \nhybrid techniques such as living shorelines will occur and increased attention will be given to retreat \nand avoid strategies. The capital and operating costs of dikes may limit their implementation to selected \n\nlocations, such as densely populated areas, areas with high natural or cultural importance, and high value \ninfrastructure.\nFunding for dike upgrades requires a large capital outlay, and requires approval by di˚erent levels of \ngovernment. Intermittent funding programs may not be appropriate where the need for upgrades \n \nis ongoing and long-term. It may be di˝cult to obtain public acceptance depending on the capital costs \nand the distribution of those costs, especially if property views are impacted. \n97 Refers to an extreme tide which occurs every 18.03 years in the Gulf of Maine-Bay of Fundy region when 3 tidal elements peak at the \nsame time: anomalistic, synodical and tropical monthly cycles.\n98 (Liekse and Bornemann 2012)\n', '67Sea dike upgrade costing study, Metro Vancouver, British Columbia\n99 In 2011 the Province of  British Columbia published a Climate Change Adaptation Guidelines for \nSea Dikes and Coastal Flood Hazard Land Use (Ausenco Sandwell, 2011), which de˜ned sea level \nrise planning levels and ˛ood protection requirements. The guidelines propose an updated design \nmethodology for coastal ˛ood protection measures, including new design criteria for sea level rise, \nsubsidence, storm surge and wave e˚ects. \nTo gain a greater understanding of what implications the new guidelines would have on the ground, \nthe B.C. Ministry of Forests, Lands and Natural Resource Operations commissioned a study to develop \na ‚Class D™ estimate of the cost to adapt ˛ood protection to meet the rise in sea level predicted by \n2100. The study covered the Metro Vancouver coastal shoreline and the Fraser River shoreline as far \neast as the Port Mann Bridge, some 250 km of shoreline and dikes in total. Within this area both diked \nshorelines and low-lying areas that may require protection as sea level rises were considered.\nThe report calculated the full costs of establishing ˛ood protection for seismic stabilization of the \ndiking system and the sea level rise projected to take place by 2100, including land acquisition, \nengineering, environmental design, relocation of utilities, and upgrading of pump stations and other \nassociated works. The total estimated cost was $9,470 million, including a 50% contingency factor. \n The estimated cost for sea level rise alone, including associated infrastructure and property acquisition \n\nwas $2,810 million. \n99Environmental\n Œ Environmental impacts include the lost intertidal areas from the seaward expansion of a \ndike, or of agricultural and open space areas where a landward expansion is involved. The presence of dikes \nimpedes natural shoreline migration Œ an adaptive response of coastal habitats to rising sea levels.\nSocial\n Œ Social implications include the loss of housing due to land acquisition, impacts on views and loss \nof community amenities in and around dikes.\nDikes provide some assurance of land stability and therefore tend to promote shoreline development. \nUnless such structures are designed to meet a long-range design standard, they can lead to a false sense of \nsecurity. If Flood Construction Levels and setbacks are not increased due to sea level rise and other climate \n\nchange e˚ects, the level of protection provided by a dike will gradually decrease over time. \nHard protection methods have a long history of successful use, although in the rare instance of failure, the \nconsequences can be very severe. Dikes can also provide a secure corridor, such as a road or trail, and often \nenhance recreation value.\nImplementation Measures and Challenges \nApart from the high costs for construction, dike implementation measures require land acquisition for the \n\nlinear corridor occupied by the dike as well as access for maintenance and emergency measures. The linear \ncorridor may a˚ect numerous landowners and may require the relocation or removal of other structures. \nThere are often environmental and social issues as outlined above.\n99 (Ausenco Sandwell 2011)\n', '68Advantages\nDisadvantages\nDikes can be engineered to provide a reasonably high \nlevel of protection, if adequately maintained.\nDikes can provide protection for high value development \nand maintain or enhance property values. \nDikes have the secondary e˚ect of containing internal \ndrainage on the land side, requiring it to be discharged \nthrough ˛oodbox structures that can be closed at high \n\nsea levels, and pumped or opened to release water at low \n\ntides. This can also be a disadvantage.\nThe dike crest may be available for use as a recreation \ncorridor.\nDikes are expensive to construct and can be unsightly. \nThey may restrict access to the shore and reduce the \n\nrecreational value of a shoreline. \nDikes may cause erosion to adjacent unprotected areas. \n\nDikes and revetments tend to absorb wave energy and \ntherefore will be subject to damage and will require \nongoing maintenance and investment.\nDikes can result in a loss of intertidal areas and impede \nnatural shoreline migration. \n4. Other Hard Protection\nTool Description\nThere are several types of other hard protection structures commonly used within a coastal context. \nGroynes \nare rigid structures typically constructed of riprap or other heavy material extending from the \nupper foreshore or beach into the water. They are located perpendicular to the shore or at a slightly oblique \nangle. Groynes are used to dissipate wave energy, trap the movement of sediment along an intertidal area \nand reduce the seaward transport of sediment (this may cause erosion on one side and accretion on the \n\nother). They function by realigning short sections of the shore with respect to the incoming waves.\nBreakwaters\n are rigid structures typically constructed parallel to the coast for the purpose of reducing the \namount of wave energy reaching the shore. A perched beach retained by a submerged structure may be \nconsidered a subset of this category.\nO˜shore breakwaters\n may also be called \nbulkheads\n. They are designed to reduce the intensity of wave \naction in inshore waters and thereby reduce coastal erosion or provide safe harborage. Breakwaters may \nalso be small structures placed o˚shore in relatively shallow water designed to protect a gently sloping \nbeach or a vertical retaining wall designed to hold and prevent soil from sliding seaward. \nSeawalls\n are typically vertical concrete or rock structures constructed to provide protection against erosion \nand ˛ooding. Seawalls are built parallel to the shore and generally have a deep foundation for stability.\nSea dike and upgraded \n\nOliver Pump Station, \nCorporation of Delta, B.C. \n (Photo: Graham Farstad)\n', '69Revetment\ns are covers or facings which provide erosion resistance to a sloped surface. They can be \nconcrete, timber, armour rock (riprap), gabions and other materials. The terms seawalls and revetments \n can, on occasion, be used interchangeably.\nFloodwalls\n are vertical structural barriers, typically constructed of concrete, and designed for use in \ncon˜ned areas over short distances to prevent ˛ooding. \nStorm Surge \nand Tidal Barriers\n consist of hard engineered protection with movable or ˜xed barriers/gates \nwhich are closed to prevent ˛ooding when extreme water levels are forecast. \nApplication\nGroynes\n are typically used to impede the drift of sediment along a beach. Their e˚ectiveness depends \nupon a supply of sand and the existence of longshore sediment transport. They are often constructed \n as a series of structures and may be used in combination with beach nourishment.\nBreakwaters\n are used to protect marinas, ports, harbours and other shoreline infrastructure from storm \nsurges and wave action.\nSeawalls\n are most often used to dissipate wave energy, as well as ˛ooding and erosion in constrained \ncoastal areas. This may occur where the land drops o˚ sharply on the seaward side or where the cost of land \nacquisition for a dike is prohibitive. A seawall provides a ˜rm boundary between the land and the sea and \nprovides protection up to the design height of the seawall. Seawalls are typically in place where available \n\nspace is constrained due to physical or cost factors. \nFloodwalls \nare typically used in locations where space is limited and where land uses and values are very \nhigh. Floodwalls are used where the use of a dike or other lesser cost structure is precluded, due to con˛icts \nwith buildings and other land uses.\n Storm Surge Barriers\n are constructed across river estuaries and are equipped with gates that can be closed \nin the event of a storm surge.\n100 They are most commonly used to protect tidal inlets and estuaries. Their \nprimary function is to prevent coastal ˛ooding, but they can shorten the length of defences behind the \nbarrier. Water is discharged through or pumped over the barrier depending on the applicable conditions. \n100 A more detailed discussion of these features can be found in (Linham and Nicholls 2010)\nNW Arm Sea wall at \nFleming Park under \nconstruction June 2012, \nHalifax, NS', '70Evaluation and Governance Considerations\nEconomic\n Œ Considerations related to these measures are similar to those of dikes. Groynes, breakwaters \nand storm surge barriers also involve high construction costs. For all hard protection, an engineering \nanalysis should be undertaken with respect to capital and operating costs as well as risk and impact \nmitigation. \nEnvironmental\n Œ Considerations are similar to those for dikes except for the linear corridor requirements \nof a dike. Groynes, breakwaters and storm surge barriers may cause negative environmental impacts and \ntransfer risk onto nearby properties.\nSocial\n Œ Criteria are similar to those of dikes. \nImplementation Measures and Challenges \nImplementation of any form of hard protection will, in most cases, involve large costs and funding. Apart \nfrom the construction costs implementation of hard protection measures may require land acquisition and \nauthorized access to undertake maintenance and emergency measures. A particular challenge a˚ecting \nthe implementation of a groyne is the potential to transfer risk from one riparian property to another or \ncreate a negative economic, social or environmental impact.\nExample: Sept-Îles, \nQC hard protection challenges \nIn the municipality of Sept-Îles in Quebec, measures to protect against erosion have primarily involved \nriprap structures constructed and paid for by the municipality, sometimes with assistance from the \nProvince or private property owners. Property owners require a permit before such measures can be \nimplemented, however, many have built riprap structures without permits over the years. \nThe result is a patch-work mix of varying quality and integrity. The riprap installed in the bay to protect \nthe downtown core from ˛ooding has held up well over the years and appears to be doing its job. The \n\nareas. It has been observed in the areas that extend out from the bay that riprap structures appear to \nhave contributed to increasing erosion particularly in the gap areas where the structures are not as well \nconstructed or are absent. \nFor this reason, in 2000, municipal o˝cials requested that the province conduct detailed research on \nerosion in the area. As a result of this research, all structural measures, save for adding sand to the \nbanks, have been prohibited since 2005.\n', '71Advantages\nDisadvantages\nMany forms of hard structural protection can be \nengineered to provide a reasonably high level of \n\ndependability, if adequately maintained.\nHard structural protection can provide protection for \nhigh value development or natural areas and maintain or \nincrease property values. \nA seawall may be available for use as a recreation corridor. \nThe Stanley Park seawall in Vancouver is an example of an \n\noutstanding success with major recreation and economic \nspin-o˚ bene˜ts.\nStructural measures to protect against erosion in one \nplace can increase erosion elsewhere. This situation may \n\noccur where incoming waves approach the shoreline at \nan angle causing sediment to move along the shoreline \nuntil blocked by a groyne.\nA groyne o˚ers limited protection against extreme events \nand may negatively impact adjacent riparian areas. \nA seawall or ˛oodwall re˛ects more wave energy, which \nmay cause localized erosion at the toe and require a deep \nfoundation.\nSeawalls and other hard protection structures are \nexpensive to construct and maintain, can be unsightly \n\nand restrict shore access.\n5. Wet Floodproo˜ng\nTool Description\nWet ˛oodproo˜ng consists of measures which allow water to enter and exit a structure with minimal \ndamage. Wet ˛oodproo˜ng involves the use of ˛ood resistant materials, the elevation of electrical and \nmechanical services and the use of openings for drainage. This tool is distinguished from dry ˛oodproo˜ng \nwhich aims to make a building watertight or impermeable to an expected ˛ood.\nApplication\nWet ˛oodproo˜ng has limited applicability and is not commonly used. It may be used for existing \n\ndevelopments with small land parcels built where infrastructure is slightly below the established Flood \nConstruction Level. A commercial storefront abutting a sidewalk that is at an elevation subject to ˛ooding \nhas few alternatives if the building has no setback from the property line. Wet ˛oodproo˜ng may be a \nviable alternative to elevating an existing residential property on a small lot above the ˛oodplain.\nWet ˛oodproo˜ng may be used where the area subject to ˛ooding is not used for habitable purposes, these \nmay include vehicle parking areas and areas used for the storage of goods not damageable by ˛oodwaters.\nFigure 8 - Wet ˛oodproo˜ng design\n101 with window openings which allow for passage of ˛ood waters \n (Drawing: the Arlington Group Planning + Architecture Inc.)\n.101 (Arlington Group Planning + Architecture Inc. 2001)\n(Photo: Don Jardine)\n', '72Evaluation and Governance Considerations\nEconomic\n Œ Economic considerations include the cost of installing or retro˜tting ˛ood-resistant materials, \nand constructing or retro˜tting electrical and other services damageable by ˛oodwaters at a higher \nelevation. Adequately sized openings must be provided to equalize hydrostatic pressure. Owners must be \nwilling to experience a temporary loss of use of areas subject to ˛ooding and must ensure damageable \ngoods are not located in areas subject to ˛ooding.\nEnvironmental\n Œ Environmental implications of this tool are minimal.\nSocial\n Œ Wet ˛ood proo˜ng may reduce the risk of ˛ooding to people and buildings. Post-˛ood recovery \ntime may be rapid compared to ˛ooding of buildings without ˛ood resistant materials. \nImplementation Measures and Challenges \nImplementation involves the use of ˛ood-resistant materials, as well as the strategic placement and \nuse of building openings and the electrical, mechanical, heating and ventilation equipment. A detailed \nlist of ˛ood-resistant materials and their application has been published by the US Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency based on destructive testing by the US Army Corps of Engineers. Challenges include \nthe cost of implementation and the limited circumstances in which wet ˛oodproo˜ng is applicable for \nlong-term adaptation to Sea Level Rise.\nAdvantages\nDisadvantages\nCan reduce the time and cost of cleanup after a ˛ood.\nWet ˛oodproo˜ng can be less costly than other retro˜ts \nas no additional land is required and the appearance of \n\nthe building is minimally a˚ected.\nAllowing water to enter and exit a building may be a \n cost-e˚ective alternative to dry ˛oodproo˜ng.\nA wide range of water resistant materials can be used at \n a reasonable cost.\nWet ˛oodproo˜ng has limited applicability and appeal \n \nfor sea level rise.\nClean-up is still required post-˛ood.\n\nA residential building will be uninhabitable during \n \nGoods may be damaged by ˛oodwaters if they cannot \n be moved to higher ground. \n', '73Non-Structural (Soft Armouring)\n1. Coastal Wetland Creation or Restoration\nTool Description\nWetlands are some of the most ecologically important and vulnerable coastal habitats. Coastal wetlands \nare found in the ﬁtransition zoneﬂ between land and sea, and have both upland and aquatic characteristics. \nAs a result, they are extremely productive ecosystems and often have a richer ˛ora and fauna than other \nenvironments.\n102 Functionally, coastal wetlands assist with wave and tidal dissipation, and their vegetation \nand root systems act as a trap for sediments, facilitating accretion and reducing erosion. In the absence of a \nbarrier to migration, if a wetland or salt marsh is losing area on its seaward side, it is likely claiming area on \nits landward side. This adaptive ability contrasts sharply with traditional human-made coastal defences that \nare static and typically require the continuous input of resources.\n103 The most commonly restored coastal \nwetland ecosystems are salt marshes.\nApplication\nOn the seaward side, this tool can be used as part of a protect or accommodate strategy. On the landward \nside, wetland creation can be part of an avoid strategy or provide a transitional land use as part of a long-\nterm strategy of managed retreat. This tool does not apply to rocky coastlines or where the ocean depth \ndrops rapidly.\nEnabling Legislation\nThere is no speci˜c legislation governing wetland restoration although the Federal \nSpecies at Risk Act\n may \n\napply. Wetland creation may be facilitated through Environment Canada™s Ecological Gifts Program. \nTo e˚ectively manage and conserve wetlands, the New Brunswick Provincial Government developed a \nWetlands Conservation Policy. The policy, approved in 2002, had two main objectives: (1) the maintenance \nof wetland function and (2) the securement, stewardship, education and awareness of wetlands. \n\nSubsequently, parts of the policy were dropped after complaints from some businesses and landowners \nthat it was too restrictive.\nEvaluation and Governance Considerations\nEconomic\n Œ Considerations include the economic bene˜t of reduced ˛ood risk to people and property, the \ncost of securing the land (which includes land covered by water) through a foreshore lease or other means, \n\nthe cost of creating or restoring the land and the cost for long-term management. Environment Canada™s \nEcological Gifts Program, through which a landowner donates ecological sensitive land and receives a tax \nbene˜t, may be of assistance, although this program does not apply to existing intertidal areas, which are \nowned by the Crown throughout Canada. \n102 (Ecology Action Centre n.d.)\n103 (Singh, Walters and Ollerhead 2007)\n', '74Environmental\n Œ Environmental considerations include the environmental bene˜t of the wetland creation \nor restoration such as new or enhanced habitat for ˜sh and shell˜sh and improved water quality.\nSocial\n Œ Passive recreational activities, such as bird watching and interpretive opportunities, may \ncomplement the creation of coastal wetlands. Passive recreational features include elevated walkways, at \ngrade walkways subject to periodic ˛ooding, blinds and waterfowl observation towers for naturalists. In \nconjunction with other tools, wetland creation may reduce the land requirements for linear protection.\nImplementation Measures and Challenges \nLike any tool, the appropriateness of wetland or salt marsh restoration must be evaluated on a site-by-site \n\nbasis. Understanding the biophysical conditions under which restoration is being considered is particularly \nimportant as these may ultimately determine the long-term sustainability of a restored wetland or marsh.\n104 Implementation measures include land acquisition, foreshore lease, covenant or other form of protection. \n\nAn assessment of the area by a Registered Professional Biologist or other quali˜ed professional should \ntake place. Financial resources are required to undertake the necessary investment to create or restore \n\ninclude acquiring the wetland area (i.e., tenure from a private land owner), securing the necessary funds \nand undertaking long-term maintenance.\n104 (Singh, Walters and Ollerhead 2007)\nFraser River Park \n Vancouver, B.C. \n (Photo: Hay & Company \nConsultants Inc.)\n', '75Advantages\nDisadvantages\nThe main bene˜t is the reduction of incoming wave and \ntidal energy through dissipation in the intertidal zone. \nCoastal wetlands or salt marshes are cost e˚ective relative \nto static man-made coastal defence structures.\n108Wetlands can help reduce coastal ˛ooding and stabilize \n\nshorelines. \nWetlands can provide highly productive new habitat and \nenvironmental bene˜ts.\nCoastal wetlands have capacity to improve water quality \nand ˜shing in coastal waters by providing vital breeding \nand nursery grounds for ˜sh and shell˜sh.\nProvided wetlands are not subjected to coastal squeeze \nand that the rate of sea level rise is not too rapid to keep \n\npace, wetlands are capable of adapting to sea level rise \nwithout further intervention or investment.\nFor a protect strategy, space requirements in areas with \nexisting development or high development potential \n\nmay have attendant high acquisition costs.\nA lack of public awareness of the ˛ood and erosion \nprotection bene˜ts o˚ered by these environments can \n be a potential barrier to implementation.\nWetland creation is not feasible in many areas due to \nunsuitable bathymetric conditions or excessive erosion.\n2. Dune Building or Rehabilitation\nTool Description\nNaturally occurring dunes are wind-formed sand deposits representing a store of sediment in the zone \njust landward of normal high tides. They typically occur along wide sandy coastlines, and are dynamic and \nconstantly moving. Natural sand dunes provide an e˚ective defence against coastal erosion and ˛ooding \nby dissipating incoming wave energy from a storm surge, wave run-up or extreme high tide. Dunes form a \nbarrier similar in function to a seawall but are more dynamic, as they have the ability to adjust in response \nto changes in wind and wave climate or sea level. \nArti˜cial dunes are engineered structures created to mimic the function of natural dunes. At its simplest, \narti˜cial dune construction involves placing sediment from dredged sources and shaping them to form \ndunes.\n106 Dune rehabilitation refers to the restoration of natural or arti˜cial dunes in order to gain the \n\n\nvegetation roots help stabilize the dune. Historically, sand dunes have often been removed or altered, \neither because they represent an economical source of construction materials or are a barrier to coastal \naccess or views. Naturally occurring dunes have often been seen as con˛icting with human settlement as \nthese same coastlines are often the most desirable places for development. \nApplication\nDunes occur very infrequently along the west coast of B.C. but are more common on the east coast of \n\nVancouver Island and the east side of Graham Island in Haida Gwaii. They occur more frequently in Quebec \nand Atlantic Canada, particularly in P.E.I. They are found most frequently along wide sandy coastlines and \nmay be used in combination with beach nourishment. \nDune creation or restoration requires compatible sediment. Vegetative planting or fences may be used \nto stabilize an arti˜cial dune. A 2011 project by the Souris Wildlife Federation on the causeway at Souris, \nP.E.I. has installed snow fencing and spruce boughs in an e˚ort to trap sand to build up the dunes to help \nprotect against future storm surges.\n105 (Singh, Walters and Ollerhead 2007)\n106 (Linham and Nicholls 2010)\n', '76Evaluation and Governance Considerations\nEconomic\n Œ Economic considerations include the availability and cost of sand, the cost of equipment, the \nfrequency with which dunes need to be replenished and the cost of the land or foreshore lease required \n to accommodate dune building.\nEnvironmental\n Œ Dune creation and protection is one of the limited number of tools likely to have a \npositive environmental impact (e.g., increased habitat in limited supply, tool that works with nature).\nSocial\n Œ On one hand, creating dunes on the landward side may result in a loss of land for existing residents \nand property owners. Loss of views and direct access to coastal areas may a˚ect existing residents. On \n\nthe other hand, opportunities for passive recreation could increase. Implementation could serve as a \ncommunity education process about non-structural measures used in adapting to sea level rise. Creating \ndunes on the ocean side may not be feasible.\nImplementation Measures and Challenges \nImplementation requires an area (land or foreshore) to be set aside, a source of sand to create or \nrehabilitate dunes, equipment to move and shape sand into a dune, and funding sources for capital \nand ongoing maintenance. Key challenges include the availability of suitable material, the cost of \nimplementation and maintenance, the equitable allocation of project costs between bene˜ting property \nowners and society as a whole, and obtaining public support. \nAs an example of potential challenges, Sept-Îles in Quebec has a regulation\n107 banning all structural \nprotection for private property owners, except for sandbanks. Construction of these banks requires a \nprovincial permit which the Province will not presently issue to individuals, a challenge to the cohesive \n use of this tool.\n107 Règlement No. 02-2005, Règlement do contrôle intérimaire relatif aux zones de risque d™érosion littorale en bordure du ˛euve Saint-Laurent \net de l™estuaire de certaines rivières du territoire de la MRC de Sept-Rivières (Regulation number 02-2005, Interim regulation related to \n\nerosion risk zones along the St. Lawrence and for certain river estuaries in the RCM of Sept-Rivières).

Jardine)\n', '77Advantages\nDisadvantages\nDunes can be used to provide an e˚ective defence \nagainst coastal ˛ooding and erosion by maintaining wide \n\nsandy beaches, which dissipate wave energy, and can \nserve as a store of sediment, which can be accessed in \norder to satisfy erosional forces. \nDune protection can meet multiple objectives, including \nenvironmental enhancement and protection, public and \n\nrecreational access, and hazard reduction. \nDunes can be created in a sensitive manner by taking into \naccount the environment in which they are placed. Dunes \nand the vegetation of dunes can provide an important \n\nenvironmental bene˜t by creating or increasing valuable \n\ncoastal habitat for species at risk. \nDunes, especially arti˜cial dunes, can be perceived as a \n\nbarrier to beach access, and a dune creation proposal \n\nmay run into community opposition. While providing \nprotection from erosion, dunes may con˛ict with \nresidential or tourism purposes where the concern is \n\nmaintaining ﬁsea viewsﬂ. Dune development may be \n\nseen as an opportunity to encourage additional coastal \ndevelopment at risk from sea level rise.\nDunes are not static like hard forms of protection. They \nare dynamic and constantly evolving, and therefore \n\nrequire careful long-term management.\nDunes as an sea level rise adaptation tool have limited \napplicability since sandy shorelines and suitable material \n\nare not present in many areas. As well, the bathymetry \nnear the shoreline may not be suitable for the use of this \ntool. Dunes may require a large footprint, which may have \n\nsigni˜cant cost implications.\n3. Beach Nourishment\nTool Description\nBeach nourishment refers to the addition of sand or other similar beach sediment material to satisfy the \nerosional forces of natural wave action and prevent shoreline erosion. As waves run up on a beach, they \n\nadding a sediment supply, the beach is maintained at a width that provides storm protection and acts as a \nbu˚er. The cross-sectional shape of a beach a˚ects its ability to dissipate wave energy: a wide and shallow \nbeach will attenuate wave energy more e˚ectively than a steep and narrow beach. \nBeach nourishment reduces the detrimental e˚ects of coastal erosion by providing additional sediment \n\na sacri˜cial element against coastal erosion, rather than a hard barrier. Beach nourishment will likely be \nrequired on an ongoing basis as long as the forces of erosion are present.\n108 Application\nBeach nourishment can use sediment material dredged from the ocean, or material barged, trucked, \n\nmoved by heavy equipment or by a conveyor belt from a land-based source. The rate of erosion needs to \nbe monitored on a regular basis, typically by a cross-sectional analysis. If the available beach material drops \nbelow to a critical level, re-nourishment will be required to avoid further erosion and damage to coastal \ninfrastructure. A sediment budget is used to describe the measurement of migrating and eroding sediment \nin a manner similar to the measurement of river bed aggradation. \nBecause of annual sand erosion from the dunes and beaches in the area, a beach nourishment program has \nbeen in place at Parlee Beach (near Shediac, N.B.) since 2009. It is expected that this will become an annual \nprogram with a portion of the park entrance fee ($3) used to help pay for the program.\n108 (Linham and Nicholls 2010)\n', '78Evaluation and Governance Considerations\nEconomic\n Œ Economic considerations include the availability and cost of acquiring, moving and placing \nsand or other suitable beach material on an eroded shoreline. The allocation of costs between individual \nbene˜ting property owners and the community as a whole may need to be addressed.\nBeach nourishment may o˚er economic bene˜ts as an alternative to or in combination with other forms \n of structural protection. \nEnvironmental\n Œ Beach nourishment may enhance intertidal areas. However, negative e˚ects could \noccur if the material deposited does not match the size and composition of native beach material, if the \ndeposited material provides excessive turbidity or if the depth of material deposited buries existing marine \norganisms. \nSocial\n Œ Social bene˜ts include reduced risk and enhanced property values for waterfront properties, and \nincreased use of beach nourishment areas by the public for recreational purposes. \nImplementation Measures and Challenges \nEngineering studies over an extended time period are required to determine the rate and extent of \n\nshoreline erosion and the volume of beach nourishment required to address the sediment de˜cit. For \n large-scale beach nourishment applications specialized equipment must be used. Ongoing monitoring \n will be required to evaluate the success of the beach nourishment and when additional beach nourishment \nis required.\nChallenges include the cost of implementation, supply limitations, lack of specialized equipment and \nexpertise, the need for public education and recognition that the job is never ˜nished. \nAdvantages\nDisadvantages\nBeach nourishment provides sacri˜cial material to be \neroded, e˚ectively protecting landward areas from wave \n\naction.\nThis tool may provide an alternative to the use of hard \nprotection such as groynes which can disrupt natural \nprocesses of sediment supply to a beach.\nBeach nourishment can enhance the value of beaches by \nproviding a more aesthetically appealing environment.\nAs sediment is redistributed by the natural forces or \nerosion, it may also have a positive e˚ect on adjacent \nareas not directly nourished.\nBeach nourishment may address multiple objectives, \nincluding environmental enhancement and protection, \n\npublic and recreational access, and hazard reduction.\nThe use of beach nourishment is subject to a number of \n\nwidespread limitations, including a consistent supply of \n\ncorrectly sized sediment for the long-term and a suitable \nforeshore pro˜le.\nBeach nourishment can become prohibitively expensive \nif a supply of sediment is not readily available.\nThe value of aggregate resources including sand is highly \ndependent on the proximity of supply sources to the \n\nlocations in which they are needed.\nBeach nourishment is not a permanent solution to \nshoreline erosion. It will require regular monitoring \n and periodic re-nourishment depending on the rate \n \nof erosion that takes place.\nBeach nourishment may a˚ect the productivity of \nintertidal areas.\n', 'Combinations & Compatibility\n', '80Combinations & Compatibility\nThe 21 tools in this primer have been organized into ˜ve broad categories: planning, regulatory, land use \nchange or restriction, structural and non-structural. These ˜ve categories are intended to assist decision \nmakers in the selection, application and combination of these tools.\nSeveral of the tools are interdependent and should be used in combination, producing hybrid shoreline \nprotection systems. At ˜rst glance, structural and non-structural adaptation tools may appear to represent \n\n\nto as soft armouring or soft engineering, o˚er ˛exibility and can reduce the costs of construction and negative \nenvironmental e˚ects incurred by using structural tools alone. \nHybrid techniques from P.E.I.\nHybrid techniques were implemented at the Crowbush Golf Course on P.E.I. after a major storm surge in \n\nDecember, 2004. At Crowbush Cove, a low-lying armour stone base, known as a revetment, was installed \nparallel to the shoreline. Sand was placed on top of the revetment to re-establish the dune in the area, \nand marram grass was re-seeded on the dune to help with stabilization. After storm events, removed \nsand must be replaced. The same type of system was installed on the Panmure Island Causeway.\nDunes at Hole 16 Crowbush Cove Golf Course \n(Photo: D.

A protect strategy may be suitable for an historic area where all buildings and infrastructure \nwould be frequently inundated without the installation of linear structural protection such as a dike. \nAn accommodate strategy may apply to a new development at the margins of an area at risk of coastal \n˛ooding. An avoid strategy may be applied to prevent a proposed new residential development or a large \ncommercial or institutional development in a previously undeveloped area at risk of ˛ooding. Finally, a \n\nretreat strategy may be suitable for a rural area where the Flood Construction Level is an entire ˛oor above \nthe ground elevation. \nOver time, the choice of strategy for the same area may change due to changing circumstances, risk \nassessment or availability of resources. For example, a protect strategy relying on dikes alone may represent \n\nthe historic approach in a particular area. With a new risk analysis, an accommodate strategy might evolve \nin which all new development is required to provide scour protection and ˛oodproo˜ng of buildings.\nThe following \nCompatibility Matrix\n shows the 21 di˚erent adaptation tools and how they relate to the \nfour overall adaptation strategies. Some tools are recommended for all strategies, while other tools may \n\nor may not be appropriate to a particular strategy.

Living shorelines employ a \nsuite of techniques to minimize coastal erosion and maintain coastal processes. These include the use of \nsills, groynes or breakwaters used in combination with sand, marsh plantings, or other natural materials.\nThe bene˜ts of living shorelines include engineering bene˜ts such as cost e˚ective absorption of wave \nenergy and storm surges as well as the maintenance of natural shoreline dynamics. Environmental bene˜ts \ninclude improved water quality (by settling sediments and ˜ltering pollution), greater abundance and \ndiversity of aquatic species and a linkage between aquatic and upland habitats. \n\nwith several levels of government, riparian property owners, nature trust organizations and other \nstakeholders.\nOne of the leading proponents of living shorelines is the State of Maryland. Maryland has over 11,000 \nkilometres (7,000 miles) of tidal shoreline along Chesapeake Bay and other coastal watersheds. The \n\nstate faced an annual loss of over 235 hectares (580 acres) of coastal shoreline and a permitting issue \nwherein soft armouring was at a major disadvantage compared to structural protection. Under the \nLiving Shoreline Protection Act\n of 2008, the State of Maryland adopted non-structural ﬁliving shorelinesﬂ \nerosion control measures as the preferred method to address the impacts of shore erosion induced by \nsea level rise wherever technologically and ecologically appropriate. This legislation does not prevent the \nimplementation of hard structural measures, but requires soft or non-structural measures be considered \n˜rst. Adoption of the \nLiving Shoreline Protection Act\n followed more than 20 years of research on the \n\ne˚ectiveness of non-structural erosion control in Chesapeake Bay and other sheltered areas.\n109 In Atlantic Canada, Nova Scotia and P.E.I. now employ living shorelines approaches. In B.C., communities \n\n\nliving shores approaches are also known as ﬁGreen Shoresﬂ projects. \nGreen Shores Examples from B.C.\n110Green Shores is a trademarked program of the Stewardship Centre for British Columbia.  The Green \nShores program consists of hybrid techniques that promote the sustainable use of coastal ecosystems \nthrough planning and design that recognizes their ecological features and functions. Their four \nprinciples consist of preserving the integrity of coastal processes, maintaining habitat diversity and \nfunction, minimizing marine pollutants to the environment, and reducing cumulative impacts to the \ncoastal environment. A key program component is a Coastal Development Rating System intended for \nuse by designers, builders and owners to guide Green Shores design and assess design performance.\n110109 (Management, Policy, Science, and Engineering of Nonstructural Erosion Control in the Chesapeake Bay 2006)\n110 (Stewardship Centre for British Columbia 2012)\n', 'Non-Local Government Adaptation Tools\n', '85Non-Local Government Adaptation Tools\nInsurance and emergency management are also essential adaptation tools. Insurance plays almost no \n role in Canada, but is widely used in other developed countries. Emergency management is present in \n all provinces, but responsibility is shared with senior governments.\n1. Insurance\nInsurance is widely used to encourage sea level rise adaptation in other developed countries with extensive \nshorelines and coastal areas at risk. However, it is not currently a tool available to local governments, and its \navailability in Canada is very limited.\n111 Insurance premiums are commonly based on estimates of previous losses incurred. While this approach \ncan discourage asset investment within high-risk hazard areas, it also puts pressure on local, provincial \nand federal government to provide ﬁprotectionﬂ against the hazard. Flood insurance due to overland ˛ows \n(such as storm surge or high river levels,) surface water ˛ooding or ˛ooding caused by groundwater is not \n\navailable to homeowners in any province in Canada, though it is available for commercial development. A \n2004 survey of 2,100 homeowners by the Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction reported that close to \n70% believed they were insured for ˛ood damages.\n112 In Canada, provincial and federal governments provide ˜nancial support when uninsurable disaster-related \n\nproperty damage occurs. A drawback to such government relief in contrast to private insurance is that it tends \nto create distance between a household™s actual exposure to risk and the household™s perception of risk.\n113 This distance between actual and perceived risk can encourage people to reside in ˛ood-prone areas with \n the understanding that government will bear the cost of some ˛ood-related damages.\n114According to the insurance industry, certain conditions must be in place in order for insurance to be a viable \n\n1. Mutuality Œ a large number of people must combine to form a risk pool or community.\n2. Need Œ there must be a need for insurance to cover an anticipated risk such as ˛ooding or erosion.\n3. Ability to be assessed Œ the peril must be measurable and quanti˜ed in terms of possible losses of \neconomic value. \n4. Randomness Œ the risk  must be independent of the will of the insured and the event must not be \n\npredictable, except in a general way.\n5. Economic viability Œ the risk community must be able to cover the anticipated losses.\n6. Similarity of threat Œ the risk community must be exposed to the same threat and the occurrence of \n\nanticipated damages must result in the need for funds in the same way for each member of the risk \n\ncommunity.\nThe success of insurance depends on how these six conditions are addressed. \nNot all of these conditions are present for ˛ood insurance in Canada. The biggest challenge to the \nintroduction of ˛ood insurance in Canada is mutuality. The risk of ˛ooding does not apply equally \n\nmost exposed to a ˛ood risk will be motivated to purchase ˛ood insurance. Demand for ˛ood insurance \n111  (National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy 2011)\n112  (Sandink, et al. 2010)\n113  (National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy 2011)\n114  (Hallegatte 2006)\n', '86will be low outside of risk areas. For example, ˛ood insurance would generate minimal demand in Regina, \nSaskatchewan compared to Ladner, B.C.\nEconomic viability is another challenge. Economic viability is threatened when large losses a˚ect an area \nwith a large concentration of policy holders. Flood insurance rates would be prohibitively expensive for \nthose concentrated in high-risk areas. Some, but not all, of this risk can be addressed through reinsurance \n\n(i.e., spreading the risk among insurance companies to other areas with di˚erent risks).\nBoth of these challenges are related to a problem called adverse-selection. Demand for ˛ood insurance \n\nspeci˜cally to protect against ˛ooding if they did not live in a ˛ood risk area. Adverse selection violates \n \na basic principle of insurance, which is to spread the risk. Adverse selection results in insurance rates that \nare prohibitively high for homeowners.\nThere are several ways to address these challenges of ˛ood insurance. By bundling ˛ood insurance with \nother forms of insurance, such as ˜re and theft, insured risks are spread over a larger pool of properties, \n\nacross di˚erent perils and di˚erent rating areas. Bundling broadens the risk pool and is used to lower costs \nand increase insurance penetration rates. Bundling insurance to include ˛ood or erosion coverage can \nmake it unavoidable, or e˚ectively compulsory. \nThe United Kingdom uses this approach to overcome the challenges of ˛ood insurance. There, ˛ood \ninsurance, whether inland or coastal, is included with other insured risks and is required by mortgage \ncompanies. Bundled coverage is also in place in Japan, Spain, Portugal, Switzerland and Israel. \nAnother approach is to subsidize the cost of ˛ood insurance. In the U.S.A., ˛ood insurance is partially \nsubsidized by the federal government. Flood insurance is intentionally kept a˚ordable in order to enhance \n\nparticipation rates. Insurance premiums cover administration costs and operating costs in most years, but \nnot the full cost of major disasters.\nFlood insurance is widely used in developed countries with extensive coastal lowlands. The following \nprovides a summary of how ˛ood insurance is used in the U.S.A., Germany and the United Kingdom.\nUnited States of America\nThe National Flood Insurance Program is administered through the Federal Emergency Management Agency \n\n(FEMA) in cooperation with private insurance agencies. The National Flood Insurance Program was created by \nthe U.S. Congress in 1968 to help provide a means for property owners to ˜nancially protect themselves. Prior \nto that, private ˛ood coverage was excluded from standard homeowner policies and the primary recourse of \n˛ood victims was government disaster assistance. In its early years, even subsidized rates did not provide a \nsu˝cient incentive for homeowners to purchase ˛ood insurance or for communities to join the National Flood \nInsurance Program. Subsequent legislative changes in 1974 and 1994 required federally insured or regulated \nlenders to require ˛ood insurance as a condition of granting or continuing a loan for a building located in the \n\nSpecial Flood Hazard Area of a participating community. The federal government, through FEMA, sets ˛ood \ninsurance premium rates, identi˜es ˛ood zones and risks and sets the standard for construction in ˛oodplains. \nLocal governments are responsible for adopting development regulations that meet National Flood Insurance \nProgram standards. Close to 90 private insurers sell ˛ood insurance policies and collect ˛ood insurance \npremiums on behalf of the government but do not assume any risk.\nCurrently over 20,000 U.S. communities participate in the National Flood Insurance Program. This program \no˚ers ˛ood insurance to homeowners, renters, and business owners. The incentive is a˚ordable rates of \n˛ood insurance and coverage up to USD$250,000 for a residential building and up to USD$100,000 for \npersonal property (i.e., contents). In return, participating communities agree to adopt and enforce bylaws \n(referred to as ordinances in the U.S.A.) that meet or exceed FEMA requirements designed to reduce the risk \n', '87of ˛ooding. Flood management measures include many of the tools documented in this report. Applicable \ntools include zoning, subdivision, scour protection, structural elevation, wet ˛oodproo˜ng, easements, land \ntrust agreements and land acquisition. Mapping plays a multipurpose role. Flood Rate Insurance Maps are \nused to identify communities at risk (i.e., areas subject to a 100 year ˛ood), set insurance premiums and \nregulate development in ˛oodplains. In the 30 years since the inception of the National Flood Insurance \nProgram, buildings constructed to federal standards have sustained 77% lower losses than buildings \nwithout such protection.\nFlood insurance premiums vary according to several factors, including the deductible chosen by the \nhomeowner, the amount of protection provided, either structural elevation (dry ˛oodproo˜ng) or wet ˛ood \nproo˜ng, the date of construction and the potential and probability of a hazard. Low elevation properties \nlocated near the ocean are considered high risk due to storm surge ˛ooding and hurricane risks. The cost \nfor the maximum available building (USD$250,000) and contents (USD$100,000) insurance in a coastal \n\nhigh risk zone is up to USD$6,410 annually. This compares to similar coverage of USD$1,717 per year in a \nmoderate to low risk area and as low as USD$365 per year in a preferred risk (i.e., low) area.\nIn 2011, under the \nNational Flood Insurance Program\n, 5.5 million ˛ood insurance policies were written, \nUSD$3.4 billion collected in premiums and USD$1.43 billion paid out in ˛ood claims. Expenditures for ˛ood \n\nhazard mapping and risk analysis exceeded USD$97.7 million.\n115 In addition to managing the \nNational Flood \nInsurance Program\n, FEMA has a broad mandate to lead and support the nation in a risk-based comprehensive \nemergency management system of preparedness, protection, response, recovery and mitigation. In an \nattempt to reduce a de˜cit of over $25 billion in the \nNational Flood Insurance Program\n, the Biggert-Waters Flood \nInsurance Reform and Modernization Act\n of 2012 mandated that some subsidies be phased out, resulting in a \nlarge rate increase for some property owners.  The resulting backlash led to a proposed four year delay in its \nimplementation.\nGermany\nPrivate insurance companies in Germany have o˚ered insurance for natural hazards as a supplement to \nbuilding and contents insurance since 1991.\n116 This supplemental policy is optional for property owners \nand covers losses due to ˛ooding. However, storm surge is an uninsurable risk and is excluded from \nsupplemental policies. The market penetration for building insurance is approximately 90%, as banks \n\nmuch lower (26% in 2010).\nGermany does not have a national system of ˛ood hazard mapping. As a result, the German insurance \nindustry developed an online risk assessment tool called ZURS Geo. This geo-based data system uses \nproperty addresses to identify the risk of ˛ooding in any geographical area and o˚ers a risk-based insurance \npremium. This tool uses a four zone system, with the lowest risk being less than a 1 in 200 year event and the \nhighest being more than a 1 in 10 year event. \nFollowing a major ˛ooding of the Elbe River in 2002, the most expensive in German history, a widespread \nevaluation of the state of ˛ood insurance took place. Most private sector losses were not covered by private \ninsurance. This led to the consideration of mandatory natural hazard insurance. The compulsory insurance \noption was rejected, largely due to a major concern that buyers would experience premium shock due to \nmuch higher reinsurance requirements. Other options were pursued, including 2004 legislation passed by \nthe German Parliament prohibiting development on ˛ood prone land. As a result, it has been estimated \n\nthat 10% of the land area cannot feasibly be insured, although only 1.5% of the buildings are uninsurable. \nThe German model has been criticized for lacking incentives to strengthen private loss mitigation and \ninsurance companies for doing little to encourage precautionary measures. \n115\n116 (Sandink, et al. 2010)\n', '88United Kingdom\nThe United Kingdom has approximately 2.2 million homes at risk due to coastal or inland ˛ooding. \nApproximately 330,000 homes have a ˛ood risk greater than 1 in 75 years. Insurers have agreed to provide \ninsurance in all areas where the ˛ood probability is less than the highest risk threshold. Where the ˛ood \nprobability is greater than 1 in 75 years and improved ˛ood defenses are provided, ˛ood insurance for \nhouseholds and small businesses will be maintained. Where the ˛ood probability is greater than \n 1 in 75 years and no ˛ood defenses are planned, ˛ood insurance for households and small businesses \n is considered on a case by case basis.\n117Flood risk has been grouped according to three classes. The low probability Zone 1 consists of lands with \na less than 1 in 1,000 year ˛ood risk. The medium probability Zone 2 consists of lands with a probability \nof ˛ooding from the sea of between 1 in 200 and 1 in 1,000 years. The high probability Zone 3 contains land \nwith a greater than 1 in 200 year probability of sea ˛ooding (or greater than 1 in 100 probability of riverine \n˛ooding). Under the policy, development should be steered away from Zones 2 and 3 and toward \n Zone 1. This policy statement includes ˛ood risk changes resulting from climate change, particularly those \nassociated with sea level rise.\n118 Building insurance is not compulsory in the United Kingdom, but such insurance is generally required to obtain \nmortgage ˜nancing. Flood insurance is bundled as part of standard home insurance and is included in the \nbuilding and contents policy. Insurers generally do not refuse ˛ood coverage for residential property, regardless \nof ˛ood risk, and as a result, the vast majority of households have ˛ood insurance coverage.\n119Key features of the U.K. approach to ˛ood management include a bundled approach to ˛ood insurance, \n\na very high penetration rate of 95% for ˛ood insurance, the option for insurers to exclude very high risk \nhomeowners in order to avoid the problem of adverse-selection, risk-based ˛ood insurance pricing, partial \nrisk assumption by private homeowners through a system of deductibles, variable premiums and on-site \nrisk mitigation. Government responsibilities consist of land use planning, risk assessment through the \ndevelopment of ˛ood hazard maps and o˚-site structural protection measures. The Association of British \nInsurers indicated in 2007 that annual ˛ood defense spending needed to increase from £500 million to a \nminimum of £750 million in order to maintain design-speci˜cation levels of protection.\n120The national government does not have statutory authority for the management of development in ˛ood-\n\nprone areas. These responsibilities have been delegated to regional and local planning authorities although \nthey are permissive, not mandatory. Regional and local planning authorities have the authority to develop \nstrategies to appraise and manage ˛ood risk through policy development in areas subject to ˛ood hazards. \nUntil very recently the national government™s perspective was re˛ected in a series of Planning Policy \nStatements concerning town planning. \nPlanning Policy Statement 25\n concerned national policy on \ndevelopment and ˛ood risk in England. This policy ensured that ˛ood risk was taken into account at all \nstages in the planning process to avoid inappropriate development in areas at risk of ˛ooding, and to \ndirect development away from the areas of highest risk. These P\nlanning Policy Statements\n were replaced by \na single document called the \nNational Planning Policy Framework\n ˜nalized in March 2012. This document \nretains many of the previous risk management policies, although in an edited form. \n117 (Sandink, et al. 2010)\n118 (Department for Communities and Local Government, UK Government 2010)\n119 (Sandink, et al. 2010)\n120 (Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) 2010)\n', '89Of particular interest is a policy calling on local planning authorities to ﬁreduce risk from coastal change \nby avoiding inappropriate development in vulnerable areas or adding to the impacts of physical changes \non the coast.ﬂ Local planning authorities are called on to identify as a Coastal Change Management Area \nany area likely to be a˚ected by physical changes on the coast and make clear what development will be \nappropriate in such areas and in what circumstances, as well as to make provision for the relocation of \ndevelopment and infrastructure where this is needed. Another policy sets out recommended contingency \nallowances for net sea level rise that increase from 4.0 mm/year at present, to 8.5 mm/year after 2025, to \n12.0 mm/year after 2055 and to 15.0 mm/year after 2085 for London, East England and Southeast England.  \nThe Potential Role of Insurance in Adaptation\nThere are several reasons why insurance may receive increasing attention in the future. One is that the areas \n\nat risk of coastal ˛ooding and subsequent damages are anticipated to increase exponentially over time. The \ncurrent cost of ˛ood damage to private property is largely met by the provincial government and, for major \nevents, the federal government through Disaster Relief assistance. The expectation of guaranteed disaster \nrelief also reduces the incentive to take precautions in the way of ˛ood-proo˜ng or hazard avoidance \nmeasures.\n121 Senior governments are aware of the rising risk and cost implications they will increasingly \nhave to absorb under current provisions. \nSecond, the current approach involves a considerable degree of moral hazard. This refers to the tendency \nto take undue risks because the costs are not borne by the party taking the risk. If an area is subject to \n˛ood hazard, the property owner will su˚er inconvenience in the event of a ˛ood but little economic risk. \n\nThe current deductible is nominal and there is no economic incentive for a property owner to undertake \nproactive preventative action. Local governments have a wide array of tools to address new development. \nExcept in the limited cases of improvement areas in rural areas, any o˚-site structural protection will likely \nbe funded through the general tax base of a local government in association with senior governments. \nThird, the nature of ˛ood risk due to sea level rise varies considerably from one area to another. Little of that \nrisk is borne by property owners in the areas at risk. \nFlood insurance can address all of these concerns to some degree, because it will transfer some of the \nrisk away from senior governments and onto private property owners through insurance premiums. \n\nWith variable premiums, ˛ood insurance provides an incentive for a private property owner to undertake \nproactive action to reduce on-site risk. Flood insurance also provides an incentive for an avoid strategy by \nencouraging development in areas not at risk from coastal ˛ooding and penalizing development in areas \n at risk (without including land use policy and \nO˜cial Community Planning\n considerations). \nFrom the case studies discussed above, two conditions are essential to the success of ˛ood insurance. One \nis that the use of ˛ood insurance must have broad application to properties at risk, whether it follows the \nU.S.A. or the U.K. model. Second, the utility and success of ˛ood insurance is much higher if it complements \nother forms of risk reduction undertaken by property owners and local governments. \n121 (National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy 2011)\n', '90Advantages and Disadvantages of Potential Insurance Tool for Adaptation to Sea Level Rise\nAdvantages\nDisadvantages\nWould better align risk management objectives. \nHomeowners who choose to purchase in areas at risk \n\nwould pay for the additional risk and those in low risk \nareas would bene˜t from risk avoidance. Flood insurance \nprovides an incentive for an avoid strategy.\nFlood insurance premiums will spread risk with other \ngeographical areas also subject to ˛ood risk. \nOwners of residential dwellings would be able to obtain \ninsurance for the actual value of improvements (current \nDisaster Financial Assistance limit in B.C. is $300,000).\nFlood insurance could be linked with other forms of \ninsurance commonly used in Canada (e.g. house and \n\nmortgage insurance)\nHomeowners in high risk areas incur minimal risk at \npresent. \nThere is an expectation that government will provide \n\nprotection against the consequences of natural disasters. \nThe consequences of sea level rise are not intentional \nand residents of areas subject to disasters would not feel \npersonal responsibility for ˛ooding. \nAdministration of ˛ood insurance claims in other \njurisdictions is not without controversy. \n2. Emergency Management\nEmergency and post disaster management refer to measures undertaken during and after a disaster. \nEmergency Planning and Preparedness refer to measures undertaken in advance of a disaster and is discussed \nin the section on Planning Tools. Emergency management is distinguished from the Emergency Planning \nand Preparedness for two reasons. First, some emergency management functions are provincial or federal \nresponsibilities (i.e., disaster ˜nancial assistance and declaration of provincial disaster) whereas emergency \nplanning and preparedness is primarily a local government responsibility. This Primer is intended to focus on \ntools available to local government. Second, emergency management takes place during and after a disaster, \nand so cannot be considered a proactive adaptation tool like the utility tools in this Primer.\n\nand (4) mitigation\n122 or adaptation. The ˜rst is discussed under the Emergency Planning and Preparedness \ntool while the following two are discussed in this section. Response refers to warning and evacuation \nmeasures. Recovery refers to clean-up and compensation for losses. The ˜nal component may include any \nof the tools in this Primer and demonstrates that the process is iterative. \nEnabling Legislation\nIn an emergency situation, federal responsibility (all departments and agencies), where applicable, is governed \n\nby the \nEmergency Management Act\n. The \nAct\n also allows for the development of programs to deal with emergency \nevents. The federal government has exclusive responsibility for emergencies related to war, armed con˛ict and \n\ncounter-terrorism. The federal government also has responsibility for First Nations reserves through Aboriginal \nA˚airs and Northern Development Canada. This \nAct\n recognizes the interests of the provinces, territories and local \nauthorities in relation to federal assistance provided during a provincial emergency.\n123The \nEmergency Program Act\n is the applicable legislation in B.C. Further information about this \nAct\n is provided under the Emergency Planning and Preparedness tool. The provincial emergency ˛ood response \n\nis detailed in the British Columbia Flood Response Plan\n, adopted in April 2012.\nThe B.C. \nDike Maintenance Act \nof 1996 describes the powers and duties of the Inspector of Dikes, \norders that may be issued, consequences of failure to carry out an order, o˚ences and appeals. Diking \n122 (Birch Hill GeoSolutions 2008)\n123 (Birch Hill GeoSolutions 2008)\n', '91Authorities own and operate the public diking systems in B.C. and they are obliged to have a ˛ood \nresponse plan, which should be integrated with the \nLocal Authority Emergency Response Plan\n, and \nprovide emergency response.\nThe B\nritish Columbia Flood Response Plan\n describes the methodology the Province will utilize for coordinating \nactivities to manage response to a ˛ood event, depending on its magnitude. This includes the roles and \n\nresponsibilities of other levels of government, provincial ministries and agencies and other stakeholder groups.\nOther provinces also have emergency management provisions. For example, in Nova Scotia, the \nEmergency \nManagement Act\n is the governing legislation dealing with emergency management and emergency powers \nlegislation. The \nAct\n creates and gives powers to the Emergency Management O˝cer (EMO) to act on \ngovernment™s behalf in an emergency.\n124In Quebec, disaster relief funds from the Ministry of Public Security currently include support for damage \n\nincurred by major storm events, both for public infrastructure and for private property. For private \nproperties damaged or destroyed in coastal areas from storm surges, up to $150,000 in compensation can \nbe paid out to those willing to relocate, under the following conditions:\n\n\n\n\nFor the time being this mechanism is ad hoc, activated on a case-by-case evaluation of storm events \nundertaken between the Province and the impacted municipalities.\nApplication\nLocal authorities (i.e., municipalities and regional districts) have the primary responsibility for emergency \nmanagement within their jurisdiction. As noted in the section on the Emergency Planning and \nPreparedness tool, this includes the preparation of local emergency plans. Should ˛ooding occur, the \nlocal government is responsible for activating emergency plans and their emergency operations centre, \nnotifying the provincial authority of local emergency response activities, issuing evacuation notices, as \nrequired, establishing local centres for public inquiries and providing post-˛ood information. If the local \ngovernment requires emergency powers within the \nEmergency Program Act\n, including the evacuation of \nresidents, a state of local emergency should be declared.\nThe \nBritish Columbia Flood Response Plan\n details that province™s approach in co-ordinating the ministries \ninvolved in ˛ood management during an integrated provincial response event. Emergency Management \nBritish Columbia has the primary responsibility for co-ordinating the provincial management structure. \nThe Provincial Emergency Program (PEP), a division of the Ministry of Public Safety and Solicitor General, \n\nEmergency Management B.C., works with local governments year-round, providing training and support \nbefore, during and after emergencies. \nOther provincial agencies and responsibilities include the following:\n\n\ndrinking water expertise\n\n\nenvironment\n124 (Birch Hill GeoSolutions 2008)\n', '92\nforecasts and bulletins, liaise with Environment Canada regarding weather forecasts, provide oversight \nto dam and dike owners, and modeling to support ˛ood level e˚orts\n\n\nregarding infrastructure including emergency funding, as required\nThe following regulations under the \nEmergency Program Act\n further describe the program:\n\nThis regulation de˜nes the obligations of the Provincial Emergency Program, emergency plans and procedures \nof ministers and government corporations, the Inter-Agency Emergency Preparedness Council, the role of \nministers in relation to hazards, the role of ministers and government corporations in emergency or disaster.\n\nThis regulation describes compensation and disaster ˜nancial assistance, eligibility for assistance and what \nis covered. Disaster ˜nancial assistance may be claimed for eligible personal expenses (i.e., the principal \nresidence of the owner of a structure damaged or destroyed in a disaster and ﬁthe necessities of lifeﬂ of \na tenant, small business expenses, farm operation expenses, charitable or volunteer expenses and local \ngovernment body expenses). Assistance is limited to 80% of an accepted claim over a deductible of $1,000 \nup to a maximum of $300,000. Financial assistance to repair or rebuild a structure may be denied \n if assistance has been provided on two previous occasions.\n\nThis regulation outlines the required contents of Local Emergency Plans and de˜nes the powers and duties \nof a local authority under the \nAct\n.As previously noted, Quebec provides for up to $150,000 in compensation for those willing to relocate. \n\nWhere the market value of the damaged property is less than $150,000, disaster relief has served its \nintended purposes of providing compensation for private losses and acquiring high risk property to ensure \nthe Province is not subject to repeat claims for compensation. A key challenge is where the value exceeds \n$150,000, since property owners lack a ˜nancial incentive to relocate or undertake additional protective \n\nDisaster Financial Assistance Arrangements\nDisaster Financial Assistance Arrangements are designed to provide ˜nancial assistance from the federal \n\ngovernment on a sliding scale where disaster damages exceed $1.00 per capita of provincial population. \nFor disasters below this threshold, no federal assistance is provided. The federal contribution increases \nto 50% where damages are between $1.00 and $3.00 per capita of provincial population. The federal \ncontribution increases to 75% if the damages are between $3.00 and $5.00 per capita of provincial \npopulation and to 90% if they exceed $5.00 per capita of provincial population. Examples of federal \ngovernment assistance include the 1997 ˛ooding in Manitoba™s Red River Valley, the 2003 wild˜res in \n B.C.™s Okanagan Valley, and the 2013 ˛oods in Calgary and High River, Alberta. \nEach province is responsible for the development and implementation of disaster recovery assistance \nprograms, for deciding when disaster payments are provided, and for determining the amount that will \nbe provided in their jurisdiction. A 2008 revision allowed for a 15% supplement of total disaster recovery \npayouts to provinces in order to mitigate the impacts of future hazard events. The key objective of the \n\nrevised program is to reduce or prevent the recurrence of damages. \n', 'The Cost of Sea Level Rise and Adaptation\n', '94The Cost of Sea Level Rise and Adaptation\nThe cost of coastal adaptation is considered to be the sum of all investments (and maintenance costs) \nnecessary to protect coastline and human settlements located in at-risk areas. The estimated annualized \ncost for optimal levels of protection can be modest, frequently less than 0.1% of national Gross Domestic \nProduct (GDP). However, adaptation costs may be high relative to the GDP of coastal areas, as there is no \nguarantee protection costs will be absorbed fully at the national level.\n125The National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy released a report, ﬁPaying the Price: The \nEconomic Costs of Climate Change for Canadaﬂ in September 2011. The study noted that Prince Edward \nIsland has the largest proportion of its land area at risk due to ˛ooding by 2050 as a result of climate \nchange. B.C., on the other hand, has the lowest proportion of its land area at risk but the majority of \ndwellings at risk, due to the high housing density in the Lower Mainland, much of which is low lying. The \nLower Mainland, consisting of Metro Vancouver and the lower Fraser River Valley, is very vulnerable to sea \nlevel rise because of a 127 kilometre system of dikes, which were not built with sea level rise factored into \nthe design. This area also has very expensive real estate subject to ˛ood risks. \nThe report examined coastal lands that would be at risk without sea level rise (baseline case) and the \nadditional lands at risk due to climate change. The report evaluated two adaptation strategies for coastal \nareas: climate related development planning and strategic retreat. The ˜rst strategy prohibited future \nconstruction in areas expected to be at risk of ˛ooding by 2050 in a high climate change scenario. No \n\nadditional growth would be permitted, but existing dwellings could be rebuilt following a storm surge. \n The second strategy involves a gradual abandonment of newly ˛ooded areas. The National Round Table \n found that both strategies reduce the overall cost of climate change, but that strategic retreat produced \nbene˜ts one order of magnitude higher than climate-wise development planning. When pursued in \ncombination, the two strategies could lower the cumulative cost by $1 to $6 billion over the next century. \nFunding Projects Related to Sea Level Rise in Canada\nThere is currently no national program for funding shoreline protection or for combating the impacts of \n\nsea level rise along the 243,000 kilometres of coastline in Canada. Some funding for shoreline protection \nis provided via programs such as the Building Canada Fund, Gas Tax Fund, Disaster Financial Assistance \nProgram, Small Crafts Harbour Program, Infrastructure projects, Highway funding programs, St. Lawrence \nPlan, Green Municipal Fund and other federal initiatives.\nFunding is also available from Environment Canada, Environmental Damages Fund for the protection \nof and restoration of wildlife habitats in coastal areas. Natural Resources Canada has also made funding \navailable to help assess the impacts of climate change and how to mitigate and adapt to them. The \nRegional Adaptation Collaborative program has contributed valuable funding to help provinces, local \ngovernments and individuals improve their decision-making in regard to adapting to sea level rise, storm \nsurges, heavy to intense precipitation events, ˛ooding and other events related to climate change.\n125 (Hallegate 2011)\n', '95Major damage from the December 2010 storm in the Bas-Saint-Laurent Region, \nQCIn December 2010, a major storm event in the Bas-Saint-Laurent Region, QC  eroded seven metres \nof the shoreline and destroyed nearly 100 homes in the region. In the absence of a regulatory \nframework for dealing with such natural disasters, the Minister of Public Security announced that \n the province would compensate property owners up to $150,000 toward rebuilding elsewhere on \n\nsafer grounds.\nThe agreement required owners to sell their property to the municipality for $1. The municipality, \nas owner of the land, was not able to build on the land but could use it for recreational purposes. \nEighty compensation packages were issued once evaluations were conducted by the provincial \ngovernment. Many owners refused the packages, as $150,000 was not enough money for relocation. \nIn some cases, residents unable to supplement the compensation were forced to remain in damaged \nhomes in high-risk areas. Given the lack of regulation on erosion in the area, construction and \nreconstruction permits are still being issued in high risk areas. \nRecognizing that it would not be able to o˚er similar compensation in the future, in 2011 the \nprovince suggested the region adopt a 30m standard setback. Neither the region nor any of its \nmunicipalities adopted this standard, and requested more detailed research be completed in order \nto establish setback lines per coastal zone based on regionally speci˜c science (J.-p. Savard 2012).\nQuebec is a province with signi˜cant funds available for adapting to seal level rise. The ˜nancing available \n\nto municipalities for adapting to sea level rise comes via the Framework for Natural Disaster Risk Prevention \nFunds from the Ministry of Public Security. In November 2006, the province designated $55 million to \nsupport municipal adaptation projects to climate change, with $26.6 million speci˜cally earmarked for \nadaptation to coastal erosion. Municipalities apply to the fund and contribute a portion of the total initial \nbudget. The provincial money represents a one-time investment Œ the municipality is responsible for the \n\ncost of maintenance over time. This fund is expected to be renewed under the 2013-2020 Climate Change \nAction Plan. \nUnder this program, Sept-Îles was approved for a $6 million project to rebuild the sandbank on the east \nend of the city. The municipality would have to contribute $2 million of the total budget, and would be \n\nresponsible for all maintenance costs over time. The local government had di˝culty obtaining public \nsupport for the levy needed to raise funds, as it would have been applied to all residents while only the \nocean-front property owners would bene˜t. In the end, Sept-Îles declined the grant, as it could not ˜nd \n a realistic means of coming up with their portion of the contribution required. \nMunicipalities in Atlantic Canada that own property or infrastructure along the coastline have taken action \nto protect their capital assets from sea level rise, storm surges and other climate events. This includes \ninstalling shoreline protection systems at facilities such as waste water treatment facilities, streets, parks, \nrecreational facilities, and other municipal infrastructure. In 2011, Nova Scotia implemented a new \nrequirement for Federal Gas Tax Reporting for the period 2010- 2014. Nova Scotia municipalities must now \nprepare Municipal Climate Change Action Plans (CCAP) to access the Gas Tax funds. These plans must be \nsubmitted by December 31, 2013. \nMunicipalities in British Columbia have also taken proactive action. Responses vary considerably, but \nmeasures include updated O˝cial Community Plans, updated ˛oodplain mapping, increasing Flood \nConstruction Levels, raising dike elevations and appurtenant ˛ood protection structures, installing arti˜cial \nreefs and public education measures. Federal-provincial cost sharing programs in B.C. have played an \n\nessential role in the implementation of structural protection measures.\n', '96Funding Programs in Other Countries\nNew Jersey Shore Protection Program\nThe State of New Jersey provides an excellent example of innovative funding. The New Jersey \nDepartment of Environmental Protection has a Shore Protection Fund which dedicates USD$25 \nmillion annually ﬁto protect existing development and infrastructure from storm surges, sea level rise \nand shoreline migration through dune creation and maintenance, beach nourishment projects, and \nconstruction and repair of shore protection structures.ﬂ The monies for this fund are generated from a \nrealty transfer fee imposed on the recording of deeds transferring real property, calculated based on \nthe amount paid in the deed.\nWestern Australia Coastal Protection Policy and Grant Program\nWestern Australia™s Department of Transport provides up to 50% of the cost of planning, investigation, \ndesign and construction of emergency coastal protection works, public coastal protection works, \nnecessary data collection and the maintenance of marine structures for permanent coastal protection.\nOnce structures are built, the local coastal managers have ownership of the structures and are \nresponsible for ongoing repair and maintenance.\nEngland Œ Flood and Coastal Resilience Partnership Funding\nThe United Kingdom allocates £2.1 billion of partnership funding annually for ˛ood and coastal \nerosion risk management projects in England. Funding levels are related to the number of households \nprotected, the damages being prevented and any other bene˜ts. The United Kingdom Environment \n\nAgency, local authorities and internal drainage boards carry out the ˛ood and coastal risk management \nschemes using the grant funding allocated. The schemes approved are intended to reduce the risk of \n˛ooding from rivers, seas, groundwater and surface water, and to reduce the risks from coastal erosion.\nNetherlands Œ Coastal Flood Risk Management\nIn the Netherlands all funding for strengthening flood defences or nourishment comes from the national \ngovernment, and from 2000-2006 averaged •550 million per year. This amount includes funding from \nwater boards, which fund maintenance costs via water board taxes. In the Netherlands, a storm surge \nwarning system has been developed for exposed areas, as forecasting times for coastal flooding from \nstorm surges tend to be shorter than for river flooding. Dunes and dikes protect parts of the Netherlands \nsituated below sea level. \nThe design of these ˛ood defence structures are related to extreme storm surge levels. For instance, in \nthe provinces of Noord-Holland and Zuid-Holland, the structures are designed to withstand the e˚ects \nof a storm with a probability of occurrence once in 10,000 years, which corresponds to a storm surge \n\nlevel of 5 m+ Dutch Ordinance Level (NAP). The Dutch government has also made a policy decision to \nmaintain the coastline at its 1990 position. In the National Spatial Strategy of 2004, the Netherlands \nguarantee safety against ˛ooding and the preservation of the spatial quality of the coastal zone.\n', 'Appendices\n', '98Appendix A Œ Glossary\nADAPTATION\n means an adjustment in natural or human systems to a new or changing environment that \nexploits bene˜cial opportunities or moderates negative e˚ects. With respect to sea level rise, adaptation \nrefers to action taken to prepare for its occurrence. \nADAPTATION PLANNING\n refers to the process of how a community identi˜es ways in which it may be \nimpacted by climate change, and how it develops a plan to address the negative consequences.\nAPPROVING OFFICER*\n is a person appointed under the \nB.C. Land Title Act\n with responsibility for the \napproval of subdivision plans. This involves a municipal engineer or planner for a municipality or the \nNisga™a Lisims Government under the Nisga™a Treaty, or a Ministry of Transportation employee for a rural \narea within a regional district.\nARMOURING usually refers to a hard engineering approach to shoreline protection such as a dike, seawall \nor riprap. Soft armouring refers to shoreline protection measures without the use of concrete, rocks or \nother rigid barriers. \nBANK PROTECTION\n refers to the treatment of slopes of Dikes and stream banks, lakes and other water \nbodies by the placement of riprap or other forms of protection to prevent Erosion by surface runo˚, \nstream ˛ows and/or wave action.\nBATHYMETRY\n is the study of the underwater depth of the ocean ˛oor or other water body. A bathymetric \nmap measures the ocean ˛oor and is the underwater equivalent of a topographic map.\nBEACH NOURISHMENT\n refers to the addition of sand or gravel to a shoreline to o˚set the forces of erosion. \nTo be e˚ective, beach nourishment is typically required on an ongoing basis.\nCHART DATUM\n is the plane of vertical reference to which all charted depths and drying heights (i.e., \nvertical distance of the seabed exposed by the tide) are related. Chart Datum is generally a tidal datum \nand represents the least depth of water found in any place under ﬁnormalﬂ meteorological conditions. \n\nIt forms a plane so low that the water level will seldom fall below it and may also be referred to as the \nlowest astronomical tide and lowest low water. \nCLIMATE CHANGE\n refers to the process by which the average weather becomes di˚erent over time. \nClimate has changed due to natural forces over the course of history (e.g., volcanoes, ocean currents) but \nhuman activity (e.g., industry, transportation) is now considered the cause of rapid and severe climate \nchange. These changes include sea level rise, more intense and more frequent extreme weather events \n(e.g., storms, hurricanes, storm surge) and in Atlantic Canada, warmer and wetter summers and winters. \nCLIMATE\n refers to the ﬁaverageﬂ weather over a long period of time. Aspects of climate include \ntemperature, precipitation, wind speed and direction, sunshine, fog and frequency of extreme events. \nCOASTAL EROSION\n is the wearing away or reduction of coastal land resulting primarily from wave action \nalong the shore. Coastal erosion causes the shoreline to move further inland. \nCOASTAL HAZARDS\n are naturally occurring events that can pose a threat to the health or life of people, \nproperty and/or the environment in coastal areas. Types of coastal hazards include storm surges, coastal \n˛ooding and erosion.\nCOASTAL S\nQUEEZE refers to the e˚ect of shoreline retreat located between rising sea levels and hard \nstructural protection such as dikes. Coastal habitats that are unable to migrate landward are squeezed \nbetween the rising sea and hard defences. This reduces the adaptive capability and the extent of \n\nintertidal and sub-tidal habitats including saltwater marshes.\nDATUM\n refers to any numerical or geometrical quantity or set of such quantities that may serve as a \nreference or base for other quantities. A horizontal datum forms the basis for computations of horizontal \ncontrol surveys in which the curvature of the Earth is considered.

The term levee is used in the U.S.A.\nEROSION\n refers to the loss of land or bed materials due to the action of ˛owing water, which can be regular \nor highly episodic.\nESTUARY\n is a partly closed coastal or tidal body of water with one or more streams or rivers ˛owing into it \nand a free connection to the ocean.\nFLOOD CONSTRUCTION LEVEL\n (FCL)* is the Design Flood Level plus the allowance for Freeboard used \nto establish the minimum elevation of the underside of a wooden ˛oor system or top of a concrete slab \nfor habitable buildings. In the case of a manufactured home, the ground level or the top of the concrete \nor asphalt pad, on which it is located, shall be equal to or higher than the above-described elevation. It \nalso establishes the minimum crest level of a Standard Dike. Where the Design Flood Level cannot be \ndetermined or where there are overriding factors, an assessed height above the Natural Boundary of the \nwater body or above the natural ground elevation is typically used.\nFLOODBOX\n is a drainage culvert through a dike that conveys the internal drainage from a watercourse \nfrom inside the dike to the body of water (i.e., river or ocean) outside the dike. A gate is installed at the \n\noutlet end of the ˛oodbox to prevent back˛ow from the body of water to the inside and to allow gravity \n˛ow from inside to the outside.\nFLOODING\n refers to the over˛owing of water onto land. Inland ˛ooding usually results from faulty \ninfrastructure or sudden and/or heavy precipitation that exceeds the design capacity of infrastructure. \nCoastal ˛ooding usually results from high tides and storm events also called storm surges. \nFLOODPLAIN\n is a lowland area, whether diked, ˛oodproofed, or unprotected, which is at an elevation \nsusceptible to ˛ooding from an adjoining watercourse, lake, ocean or other body of water based on the \narea submerged by the Designated Flood plus freeboard.\nFLOODPROOFING\n refers to the alteration of land or buildings to reduce ˛ood damages. Floodproo˜ng \nmay include adding ˜ll to raise the elevation of a building site, structural measures such as foundation \nwalls or columns to raise a building, or combinations of ˜ll and structural measures. Floodproo˜ng also \nincludes wet ˛oodproo˜ng, in which water-resistant building materials are used to reduce damage.\nFREEBOARD\n is the vertical distance (typically 0.6 m) added to the calculated elevation of the Design Flood \nlevel to accommodate uncertainties. Such uncertainties include hydraulic and hydrological variables, \npotential for wave run-up, storm surges and other natural phenomena.\nGABIAN BASKET OR WALL\n is a form of rip-rap consisting of a cage or basket of heavy wire containing \nrocks designed to protect shorelines from erosion.\nGEODETIC DATUM\n means a set of constants specifying the coordinate system used for geodetic control \n(i.e., for calculating the coordinates of points on the Earth). The Canadian Geodetic Vertical Datum is the \n\ncurrent orthometric height reference in Canada. \nGROYNE (or GROIN)\n is a rigid structure built from an ocean shore or a river bank that interrupts the ˛ow of \nwater and limits the movement of sediment. An ocean groyne is typically constructed of rip rap or other \nheavy material perpendicular to the shore, extending from the upper foreshore or beach into the water.\nHABITABLE AREA\n means any room or space within a building or structure that is or can be used for human \noccupancy, commercial sales, or the storage of goods, possessions or equipment (including furnaces) \nwhich would be subject to damage if ˛ooded.\n', '100HIGH WATER MARK\n means that part of the ocean shore to which the waves normally reach when the tide \nis at its highest point. It is often marked by a debris or wrack line along the shore. The term strandline \nmay also be used. \nINSPECTOR OF DIKES (IOD)*\n is an o˝cial of the B.C. Ministry of Environment as de˜ned under the \nDike \nMaintenance Act\n RSBC 1996, chapter 95.\nLONGSHORE DRIFT\n means the movement of beach-grade sediments along a coast parallel to the \nshoreline. It is caused by waves obliquely hitting the shoreline.\nMITIGATION \nmeans a human intervention to reduce the occurrence or impact of an activity or to enhance \nthe ability to cope with those impacts.\nNATURAL BOUNDARY\n means the visible high water mark of any lake, river, stream or other body of \nwater where the presence and action of the water are so common and usual and so long continued in \nall ordinary years as to mark upon the soil of the bed of the lake, river, stream or other body of water \na character distinct from that of the banks thereof, in respect to vegetation, as well as in respect to \nthe nature of the soil itself. For coastal areas, the Natural Boundary shall include the natural limit of \npermanent terrestrial vegetation. In addition, the Natural Boundary includes the best estimate of the \nedge of dormant or old side channels and marsh areas.*\nPRECIPITATION\n refers to rain, snow, and hail that fall from the atmosphere.\nPUMP STATION\n is a ˛ood protection structure used to discharge water across a dike to a body of water \nwhen ˛oodboxes are closed by a high tide or high river elevation. A pump station is generally built in \nconjunction with ˛oodboxes as a combined structure. \nRESILIENCE means the capacity to anticipate, prepare for, respond to, and recover from the e˚ects of sea \nlevel rise with minimum damage to social well-being, the economy and the environment. \nREVETMENT\n is a sloping structure designed as a cover or facing to absorb the energy of incoming water \nand protect existing shoreline uses as a defence against erosion.\nRIPARIAN RIGHTS\n refer to common law rights that occur to property ownership along the shore of the \nocean, a river or lake. They typically include access to and from the water, limited rights to use the water \n\nin its natural state, and protection of the property from erosion.\nRIPRAP\n is an engineered layer of graded broken rock or other heavy material, which serves as the primary \nprotection against shear stress or Erosion from ˛owing water. Riprap protects shorelines and shoreline \nstructures by absorbing and de˛ecting the energy of waves before they reach the areas to be protected.\nRISK means the likelihood of a negative event occurring (e.g., ˛ooding due to sea level rise) combined with \nthe magnitude of the potential consequences. \nSALT MARSH\n is a coastal wetland on the edge of a shoreline or estuary where fresh water mixes with \nsea water. A salt marsh is the result of interaction between living organisms and natural forces of wind, \ncurrents, storms, tides and salt.\nSAND DUNE is a ridge of sand created by the wind. Naturally occurring sand dunes represent a store of \nsediment just landward of normal high tides. Arti˜cial sand dunes and dune rehabilitation represent a \nform of soft armouring engineered to mimic the functioning of natural dunes and reduce coastal erosion.\nSETBACK\n is a horizontal distance which a building or land˜ll must be set back from a Natural Boundary \n or other reference line to maintain a Floodway and allow for potential land Erosion.\nSPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA\n refers to the land area covered by a base ˛ood on National Flood \nInsurance Programs maps in the U.S.A. A base ˛ood means a ˛ood with a 1% chance of being equalled or \nexceeded in any given year. A base ˛ood is also known as the 100-year ˛ood and is the national standard \nused by the National Flood Insurance Program and all federal agencies for the purposes of requiring the \npurchase of ˛ood insurance and regulating new development.\n', '101STORM SURGE\n refers to strong coastal waves pushed ashore by high winds during a storm. On the coast \nthis represents the di˚erence between the observed water level and the predicted astronomical tide. \nSUBSIDENCE refers to the sinking of the Earth™s surface in response to geologic or human-induced factors \nand may occur through gradual settlement or sudden collapse. \nVULNERABILITY\n refers to the degree to which a system is susceptible to, or unable to cope with the \nadverse e˚ects of climate change, including variability and extremes. Climate change impacts include \ninland ˛ooding or coastal hazards (e.g., coastal storms, coastal ˛ooding, coastal erosion).\nWEATHER\n is the state of the atmosphere (e.g., temperature, precipitation, wind) at a speci˜c time and \nlocation.\nWETLAND\n refers to a land area that is saturated with water, either permanently or seasonally. Wetland \nareas have characteristic aquatic plants adapted to their unique soil conditions and are considered \na distinct ecosystem. Wetland water may be saltwater, freshwater or brackish. Wetland areas provide \nimportant environmental functions, principally water puri˜cation, ˛ood control, and shoreline stability. \nWetland areas are considered the most biological diverse of all ecosystems.\n*de˜nition has speci˜c application to B.C. legislation\nAcronyms \nCRE Committee of regional elected o˝cials (In French: \nCRE Œ Comité régional des élus\n)Defra\n United Kingdom Department for Environment Food and Rural A˚airs\nDPA\n Development Permit Area (speci˜c to B.C.)\nFCL Flood Construction Level (speci˜c to B.C.)\nIPCC\n Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \nGDP Gross Domestic Product\nGHG Greenhouse gases\nNGO Non-governmental organization\nPEP Provincial Emergency Program\nRCMs\n Regional county municipalities (In French: \nMRC Œ Municipalité régionale de comté\n)RAC\n Regional Adaptation Collaborative\nSLR Sea level rise\nTE Equivalent Territory\n', '102Type of \nTool\nTool\nDescription of Tool\nExamplesAuthority\nLegislation \n (if applicable)\nMeans of \nImplementation/ \nResponsible Party\nImplementation \nMechanisms\nMeans of \nEnforcement\n1.

Floodplain mapping is an \nimportant ˜rst step in developing a ˛ood hazard management plan, as ˛oodplain maps identify the \n˛ood hazard(s) and provide information on the spatial distribution of Flood Construction Levels (FCLs).\n This report contains guidance on estimating of some of the Flood Construction Level components, as \n\nwell as a scope of work for more detailed site-speci˜c engineering studies that also must be undertaken \n\nin order to derive the FCL. In addition, the report summarizes recommended standards for topographic \nmapping that also will be required in the production of coastal ˛oodplain maps. A sample coastal \n˛oodplain map and Design Brief as an illustration of the coastal ˛oodplain mapping process prepared \nfor the City of Campbell River is provided in the report. In conjunction with this project, a series of maps \nshowing potential coastal ˛ood hazard areas for the year 2100 was developed for coastal B.C. based on \napproximate FCL™s. \n This report is intended to provide a technically sound basis for local governments to develop coastal \n\n˛oodplain maps, including an estimation of Flood Construction Levels based upon best mapping \nand engineering practices. In light of rising sea levels, coastal ˛oodplain maps will also allow local \n\ngovernments to de˜ne sea level rise planning areas which will facilitate land use planning and \ndevelopment decisions.\n', '127Marlin, Amanda, Je˚ Ollerhead, and David Bruce. \nNew Brunswick Dyke Assessment Framework: Taking the First \nSteps.\n St John, N.B.: New Brunswick Trust Fund, 2007. Available at: \n http://www.mta.ca/research/rstp/NB_Dyke_Assessment_Framework_ETF_Final_Report_c.pdf\n Many salt marshes in New Brunswick have been diked and drained, but as sea level continues to rise, it \n\nwill become more and more costly to maintain dikes. This report identi˜es 3 options: reinforce, realign or \nremove the dikes and allow the salt marshes to return. Salt marshes act as bu˚er areas which naturally \nabsorb the impact of wave action and ˛ooding. The removal of certain dikes, allowing the return of salt \n\nregions of New Brunswick, such as the Tantramar Marshes, reinforcement or realignment of dikes will \nlikely be preferred due to the vital infrastructure they protect.\n In order to discuss the future of a given dike, a systematic method is needed to evaluate the dike and \n\nthe land uses it may protect. The goal of this project was to develop a tool that communities can use to \n\nassess a local dike for possible salt marsh restoration. Criteria for the assessment of dike infrastructure, \nways to measure each criterion, and the degree of di˝culty or cost are identi˜ed.\nMarlin, Amanda, et al. \nExamining Community Adaptive Capacity to Address Climate Change, Sea Level Rise \nand Salt Marsh Restoration in Atlantic Canada.\n Submitted to the Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation \nProgram, Sackville, N.B.: Coastal Wetlands Institute, 2007.

Coastal-Marine Ecosystem Based Management Tools \nNetwork and NatureServe 2013. Available at \n https://connect.natureserve.org/toolkit/ebm-tool-network/climate-adaptation-planning-tools\n. The purpose of Tools for Coastal Climate Adaptation Planning is to provide the information necessary for \n\ncoastal natural resource managers and community planners to select appropriate tools for their projects. \n\nThis guide focuses on spatially explicit solutions for climate-related planning. It provides detailed \ninformation on a set of key tools that either alone or used in conjunction with other tools can facilitate \nmulti-sector climate adaptation planning (i.e. climate adaptation planning that incorporates elements \nof ecosystem health and social wellbeing) and describes the utility and role of tools in relevant planning \nprocesses. The guide focuses on software and web-based tools that help incorporate data (geophysical, \nenvironmental or socioeconomic) and specialized analyses into the planning process. This guide is \ntargeted at practitioners and decision makers involved in coastal zone management, natural resource \n\nmanagement, protected area and habitat management, watershed management, conservation, and \nlocal planning in the coastal United States including the Great Lakes. The information and tools in this \nguide are also highly applicable to many inland and international regions.\nStanton, Elizabeth A, and Frank Ackerman. \nFlorida and Climate Change - The Costs of Inaction.\n Tufts \nUniversity, 2007.

The report e˚ectively serves as an interim evaluation of the evolving science \nmidway through an IPCC cycle Œ IPCC AR5 is due for completion in 2013.\n Each section begins with a set of key points that summarises the main ˜ndings. \n With respect to sea level rise in particular, the report states current sea level rise has been \nunderestimated: Satellites show recent global average sea level rise (3.4 mm/yr over the past 15 years) \nto be ~80% above past IPCC predictions. This acceleration in sea level rise is consistent with signi˜cant \ncontribution from melting of glaciers, ice caps, and the Greenland and West-Antarctic ice-sheets. The \nreport also states revised sea level predictions indicate that: By 2100, global sea level is likely to rise at \nleast twice as much as projected by Working Group 1 of the IPCC AR4. For unmitigated emissions it may \nwell exceed 1 meter. The upper limit has been estimated as ~ 2 meters sea level rise by 2100. Sea level \nwill continue to rise for centuries after global temperatures have been stabilized, and several meters of \n\nsea level rise must be expected over the next few centuries.\nBoateng, Isaac. \nSpatial Planning in Coastal Regions: Facing the Impact of Climate Change.\n Publication of FIG \nCommission 8 Working Group 8.4 Œ Urban Planning in Coastal Region, Copenhagen, Denmark: \n \nInternational Federation of Surveyors (FIG), 2010. Avaiable at: \n \nhttp://www.fig.net/pub/figpub/pub55/figpub55.pdf\n This report was commissioned in 2007 by the International Federation of Surveyors to investigate \n\nemerging coastal habitat issues connected to rising sea levels as a result of climate change and its \nin˛uence on planning in coastal regions. Two objectives were established: to identify the impacts of \nrising sea levels on coastal habitats and to develop planning policy and implementation guidelines to \nassist in achieving sustainable coastal adaptation. \nCase studies from twelve separate countries were covered under six headings:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The study concludes that the impacts of climate change are already a˚ecting many coastal regionals \n\naround the world. These impacts are likely to intensify over the next century. The need therefore is to plan \nfor adaptation now to reduce some of the future negative e˚ects of climate change in the coastal zone. \nCatovsky, S, et al. \nAdapting to Climate Change in the U.K.: Measuring Progress.\n United Kingdom: Adaptation \nSub-Committee, 2011. Available at: \nwww.cakex.org\n. While many jurisdictions are still in earlier stages of developing climate change action plans, in the U.K. \n\nsuch plans have been implemented, legislation has been enacted, and work is now proceeding into the \nstage of monitoring and evaluating implementation. This report is the second in a series that de˜nes \nmeasures for evaluating progress on reducing vulnerability to climate change, and provides a review \nof progress to date. Despite some evidence of progress, the report concludes that land use planning \ndecisions in areas with ˛ood risk (coastal, river and surface water) may be increasing overall vulnerability, \nand chosen methods of ˛ood defence (mainly structural) may bind communities and landowners to \nrising costs in the future. \nDelta Committee. \nWorking Together with Water.\n Findings of the Deltacomissie, Netherlands: Deltacommissie, \n2008. Available at: \nhttp://www.deltacommissie.com/doc/deltareport_full.pdf\n', '138 This strategy was developed by the Delta Committee at the request of the Dutch Cabinet to identify \ninnovative measures to protect the Dutch coast and the low-lying hinterland against the consequences \nof climate change and to include the interaction with increased river discharge in its recommendations. \nThe Dutch coastline consists of 350˙km, with 3,600˙km of primary ˛ood defenses, predominately dikes. A \nmajority of the country™s population lives in low-lying adjacent areas that are below sea level. \n The strategy is based on two pillars: ˛ood protection and sustainability. The Delta Committee stated \n\nthat a regional sea level rise of 0.65 to 1.3 m by 2100, and 2 to 3 m by 2200 should be taken into account, \nincluding the e˚ect of land subsidence. \n The study contained 12 recommendations as a matter of urgency based on a conclusion that the level \n \nof ˛ood protection must be raised by at least a factor of 10. \n Recommendations focused on building with nature by expanding the coast seaward with increased \n\nbeach nourishment (85 million m3 of sand/year from the continental shelf) and strengthened storm \nsurge barriers, including island polders. Safety standards were set as: 1/250 a year for fresh water rivers, \n1/2,000 a year for lower tidal reaches, 1/4,000 a year for an extreme water events (e.g., storm surge) \n\nfor coastal regions other than Central Holland and 1/10,000 a year for Central Holland. Limiting the \nconsequences of ˛ooding included regulation such as zoning, compartmentalisation, early warning, \ncrisis management and contingency planning.\n A ˜nal recommendation consisted of setting up a Delta Fund for ˛ood protection at arm™s length from \n\nthe national budget ˜nanced by a combination of loans and part of the country™s natural gas revenues. \nThe cost of implementing the Delta Programme was estimated to be •1.2 to •1.6 billion per annum until \n2050, and •0.9 to •1.5 billion per annum thereafter to 2100. Costs included strategic land acquisition \nand compensation for damages and loss of bene˜ts.

Integrating data from various sources, this review considers what the \nimpacts of a catastrophic storm (such as that experienced on the east coast of England in 1953) would \nbe in today™s context and then with an additional 0.4 m of sea level rise factored in. The analysis is \n\nillustrated through the use of ˜ve case studies. According to their modeling, a single major storm event \ncould give rise to costs of between £7.5 billion and £16 billion with a sea level rise of 0.4 m, and without \nany further development in a˚ected areas. Investment in improved ˛ood defences could reduce this \n˜nancial cost by between £3.7 billion and £6.8 billion.\nHallegate, Stéphane. \nSR17: The Economic Growth Impact of Sea-Level Rise.\n Migration and Global \nEnvironmental Change - Commissioned as part of the U.K. Government™s Foresight Project, U.K. \nGovernment O˝ce for Science, 2011.
