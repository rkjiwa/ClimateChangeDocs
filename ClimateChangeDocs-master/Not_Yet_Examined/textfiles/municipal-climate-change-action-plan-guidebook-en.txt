The guide aims \n\nto help municipalities reduce greenhouse gas emissions and \nidentify priorities for climate change adaptation.On December 17, 2008, the extension of the Canada-Nova Scotia Agreement on the Transfer of Federal Gas Tax Revenues \n\nwas announced by the Governments of Canada and Nova \nScotia. The Gas Tax Fund Agreement was originally signed in \n\nSeptember 2005. It provided $145.2 million in federal funding \nto invest in eligible municipal infrastructure projects from 2005 \nto 2010. Additional gas tax funding of more than $223 million over four years, starting in 2010, will enable municipalities to continue \nto invest in environmentally sustainable infrastructure projects \nthat contribute to reduced greenhouse gas emissions, cleaner \nwater or cleaner air. The Gas Tax Fund promotes the economic, \n\nsocial, environmental and cultural sustainability of Nova Scotia \nmunicipalities.As a requirement for the 2010 - 2014 Gas Tax Agreement and \nthe Municipal Funding Agreements (MFAs), municipalities will \n\nbe required to prepare and submit to Service Nova Scotia and \nMunicipal Relations (SNSMR) a Municipal Climate Change \nAction Plan (MCCAP) by December 31, 2013.The MCCAP will be an amendment to the Integrated \nCommunity Sustainability Plans (ICSP), which were prepared \nby municipalities and submitted to the province in March 2010. \nThe MCCAP will focus on both climate change adaptation and \n\nmitigation and will describe how municipalities plan to respond \nto climate change. This handbook has been prepared to serve as a guide and to assist municipalities in the preparation of their Municipal \nClimate Change Action Plan.  In addition, the MCCAP will \n\nmove Nova Scotia towards honouring commitments made in \nToward a Green Future: Nova Scotia™s Climate Change Action \n\nAction 48 - Amend funding agreements with \nmunicipalities by 2010 to require climate change strategies in \n\nmunicipal Integrated Community Sustainability Plans.

In Nova Scotia climate change poses \nrisks to communities. An increase in the frequency of extreme \n\nweather events, changes in water availability and quality, sea \n\nlevel rise and changes to the performance of infrastructure \nsystems, are creating a need for municipalities to change the way \n\nthey manage their capital assets and operations. In the past few years there has been a remarkable increase in the level of awareness associated with climate change. From \nthe municipal perspective, this awareness is focused toward \nunderstanding how these changes impact communities. It is \nthe combination of historical evidence, anecdotal observations \n\namong municipal administrators and councillors about potential \nclimate change impacts. Concerns about causes and effect \n\nhave now found their way into municipal council chambers; as \n\nclimate will cause varied and mostly harmful effects. Damage \n\n\n\nwho must now plan for an uncertain future, strategies for \nadapting to climate change and mitigating against climate \nchange are becoming extremely important. For many municipalities, adaptation to climate change is a challenge that can appear to be complex. This is mainly \n\nbecause managing risk involves uncertain outcomes and \ndebatable probabilities. Moreover, every community within \n\nNova Scotia is unique in its setting and people, and therefore \nfaces environmental and social implications that will differ \n\nfrom those of neighbouring communities. Even when climate \nchange threats are understood, the localized nature of impacts \nand the seemingly distant timeframes involved can make it hard \nto design and implement policies designed to address climate \nchange. Identifying a suitable approach to managing climate \n\nnow recognize that a planned approach to dealing with the issues \nhelps build resilience and minimize risks. Understanding Mitigation & Adaptation\nThere are two main responses to tackling the issues related to \nclimate change: mitigation, and adaptation. This guide presents \n\nprocesses designed to assist municipalities address both of these.Mitigation\n\n\nsources or enhance the sinks of greenhouse gases. Examples \n\nprocesses or electricity generation, switching to renewable \nenergy (solar energy or wind power), improving the insulation \n\nof buildings, and expanding forests and other ﬁsinksﬂ to remove \ngreater amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The \n\nobjective of mitigation efforts is to reduce greenhouse gas \n\nemissions (GHG), with the result of lowering the volume of \ncarbon that enters the atmosphere on an annual basis. Mitigation actions over the long-term will reduce GHG levels in the atmosphere and help to reduce the heating trends that \nare behind many of the climate changes we are currently \nexperiencing. Mitigation is an extremely important aspect \nof dealing with climate change, and many of the province™s \n\nmunicipalities have already undertaken actions, through their \nICSP that fall into the category of climate change mitigation. \n\nThe starting point for most of these actions involves an energy-\n\nuse and greenhouse gas emissions inventory. The inventory \n\nallows municipalities to determine where they consume energy \n\nand the amount of GHG they emit. This baseline information \n\nis critical for implementing policies to reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions and develop energy conservation programs. \nEnergy conservation programs help local governments and \ncitizens manage energy costs and reduce the production of \n\nharmful carbon dioxide emissions, which contribute to climate \nchange and affect public health. Conserving energy and reducing \n\noverall energy demand is becoming an important part of both \n\ndaily and long-term municipal management decision-making. \nThe recognition that energy prices will continue to rise into \n\nthe near future, in addition to the inevitable development of a \ncarbon market, makes energy management an important issue \n\nfor municipalities, both now and into the future.Adaptation\nAdaptation to climate change is an essential compliment to \nmitigation. Adaptation is viewed as: \nan adjustment in natural or human systems in response to actual or expected climatic \n\n\nopportunities.  The main goals of adaptation usually include: alleviating current and projected future impacts; reducing sensitivity and exposure \nto climate-related hazards; and increasing resiliency to climatic \nand non-climatic stressors. PA\nRT ONE General Background\n', '2 CANADA-NOVA SCOTIA INFRASTRU\nCTURE SECRETA\nRIAT\nSuccessful adaptation does not mean that negative impacts will not occur, only that they will be less severe than would be \n\nexperienced had no adaptation occurred. Simply put, adaptation \nis all about understanding climate impacts and effects, in order \n\nto undertake substantive actions that make communities and \nmunicipal investments more resilient to the harmful effects of \n\nweather and climate. In addition, actions undertaken may also \ncapitalize on any positive long-term opportunities that will result \nfrom these changes. Municipalities with adaptive climate change initiatives and actions already described in detail in their ICSP documents \n\nwill have a head-start in the development of the adaptation \nrequirements of the MCCAP. Work already completed can be \n\n\nand will form the foundation for any additional actions that \nmay be result from working through the adaptation planning \nframework described in Part Four of this guide. Be Prepared: The Bene˜ts of \nPlanning for Climate Change\nPlanning at the municipal and community level presents an important avenue for local adaptation as well as for \ngreenhouse gas mitigation; and there are a number of reasons \nwhy municipalities should be actively involved in planning \nfor climate change. The foremost, is that many impacts and \n\nhazards associated with climate change translate into issues \nthat are local in nature, and directly affect communities, people \n\nand businesses. Other reasons to plan include the protection of \nmunicipal investments (such as infrastructure and municipally-\nowned and operated facilities) because climate change can \nseriously damage expensive infrastructure and affect the delivery \n\nof municipal services. One of the most widely accepted, and \neffective ways to mange climate change within the context of \n\nmunicipal operations, is to develop a plan or strategy that strives \nto understand the problems and present realistic approaches to \ndealing with them. Municipalities cannot simply rely on the assumption that the prevailing climate will be more or less the same as it was over \nthe past 50 to 100 years. We can expect to live in a climate with \n\ndifferent rainfall patterns, warmer temperatures, more frequent \n\nstorms, and severe weather events. These changes in climate will \n\ndirectly affect municipalities across Nova Scotia. In particular, \n\ninfrastructure location and design, where and how land is zoned \nand subdivided for development, how water and wastewater \ntreatment plants, or how local roads and other municipal assets \nare maintained, renewed and managed.Estimated Storm \nDamage Costs\nHurricane Juan, 2003 Œ 100 million\nMeat Cove, \nOct. 2010 Œ 7.2 million\nCentral Nova, \nDec. 2010 Œ 13 million\nSouthwest Nova, Nov. 2010 Œ 5.6 million\nEarly adoption of policies on climate change will help to develop a strategic approach to determining where to best focus \nmunicipal efforts, resources and new infrastructure expenditures. \n\nPlanning for climate change helps to make decisions more \ncost-effective and also helps to guard against unforeseen \n\nand burdensome costs. This approach is in direct opposition \n\nto reactive policies and actions that attempt to minimize \nconsequences after an event that has already occurred. A reactive \n\napproach has been shown over and over to be far more costly to \nmunicipalities. Hurricane Juan, for example, is estimated to have \ncost over 100 million dollars in damages.How Municipalities will be affected:\nRising costs of damaged infrastructure\nProtection and repair\nPublic safety\nDrinking water quality\nWastewater and Storm water management\n\nLiability\nPublic expectation\nLike any program, the sooner municipalities begin to plan for climate change, the more likely the behavior will become \ninstitutionalized, and integrated into daily practice so that \neventually, all decisions will be framed within a context that \n\nensures that climate change criteria are applied.Public Participation\nFor the purposes of the MCCAP the public participation \n\ncomponent of the plan will be adequately covered through the \ninclusion of stakeholders in the process (see Part Two, Step \n\nOne). Municipalities may also expand this part of the process to \ninvolve a broader scope of public participation.Regional Action Plans\nMunicipalities can work together on a regional level to tackle \ncommon impacts, issues and problems associated with climate \nchange, at both the mitigation and adaptation levels. Regional \ncollaboration allows municipalities to pool resources which can \nbe directed towards regional-scale objectives; and wherever \npossible, municipalities are encouraged to work together in this \ncapacity. \n', 'MUNICIPA\nL CLIMAT\nE CHANGE ACTION PLAN3 CANADA-NOVA SCOTIA INFRASTRU\nCTURE SECRETA\nRIAT\nMunicipalities that do wish to work with one another should \nwould entail, and what individual MCCAP, MFA and Gas \n\nTax responsibilities remain, regardless of the inter-municipal \n\nadaptation partnership. Department of \nEnvironment \nClimate Change Portal\nDuring the preparation of the MCCAP, municipalities should \n\ncontact or visit the website of the Climate Change Directorate \nwith Nova Scotia Environment (NSE). The Climate Change \n\nDirectorate actively gathers and conducts research relating to \nclimate change as it applies to Nova Scotia.

Climate change may be due to natural internal \n\nprocesses or external forcings, or to persistent anthropogenic \nchanges in the composition of the atmosphere or in land use. Note that the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nof climate which is attributed directly or indirectly to human \n\nactivity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere \n\nand which is in addition to natural climate variability observed \nover comparable time periods™. The UNFCCC thus makes \na distinction between climate change attributable to human \nactivities altering the atmospheric composition, and climate \nvariability attributable to natural causes. Climate Change Mitigation:  Technological change and \nsubstitution that reduce resource inputs and emissions per unit of output. Although several social, economic and technological \n\npolicies would produce an emission reduction, with respect to \nClimate Change, mitigation means implementing policies to \nreduce greenhouse gas emissions and enhance sinks.Climate Scenario: \nrepresentation of the future climate, based on a consistent set of climatological relationships and assumptions, typically \nconstructed for explicit use as input to climate change impact \nmodels. A ﬁclimate change scenarioﬂ is the difference between a \n\nclimate scenario and the current climate.Eligible Project:\n  Capital infrastructure projects and capacity-building projects which meet the terms of the Municipal \nFunding Agreement, and are listed in Schedule 1 of the \n\nAgreement.Extreme Weather Event: \nAn event that is rare at a particular \nweather event would normally be as rare as or rarer than the \n10th or 90th percentile of the observed probability density \n\nextreme weather may vary from place to place in an absolute ', '4 CANADA-NOVA SCOTIA INFRASTRU\nCTURE SECRETA\nRIAT\nsense. Single extreme events cannot be simply and directly attributed to anthropogenic climate change, as there is always \n\nnaturally. When a pattern of extreme weather persists for some \n\ntime, such as a season, it may be classed as an extreme climate \nevent, especially if it yields an average or total that is itself \nextreme (e.g., drought or heavy rainfall over a season).Greenhouse Effect: \nGreenhouse gases effectively absorb \nthermal infrared radiation, emitted by the Earth™s surface, by \n\nthe atmosphere itself due to the same gases, and by clouds. \nAtmospheric radiation is emitted to all sides, including \ndownward to the Earth™s surface. Thus, greenhouse gases trap \n\nheat within the surface-troposphere system. This is called the \n\ngreenhouse effect. \nGreenhouse Gases (GHGs):\n Greenhouse gases are those gaseous constituents of the atmosphere, both natural and \n\nwavelengths within the spectrum of thermal infrared radiation \nemitted by the Earth™s surface, the atmosphere itself, and by \n\nclouds. This property causes the greenhouse effect. Water vapour \n\n(H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), methane \n(CH4) and ozone (O3) are the primary greenhouse gases in the \nEarth™s atmosphere. Moreover, there are a number of entirely \n\nhuman-made greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, such as \nthe halocarbons and other chlorine and bromine containing \nsubstances, dealt with under the Montreal Protocol.

Although \nseveral social, economic and technological policies would \nproduce an emission reduction, with respect to Climate Change, \nmitigation means implementing policies to reduce greenhouse \ngas emissions and enhance sinks.Planned Adaptation: Adaptation that is the result of a deliberate policy decision, based on an awareness that conditions have changed or are about to change and that action \nis required to return to, maintain, or achieve a desired state.Resilience: The ability of a social or ecological system to \nabsorb disturbances while retaining the same basic structure and ways of functioning, the capacity for self-organization, and the \n\ncapacity to adapt to stress and change.\n\n\ninfrastructure that were either not available or not considered \n\n\nin the context of climate change is generally to ensure that \n\nbe required under altered climate conditions.Risk: A combination of the likelihood (probability of \noccurrence) and the consequences of an adverse event (e.g. \nclimate-related hazard).Risk management: A systematic approach to setting the best \ncourse of action under uncertainty, by applying management \n\npolicies, procedures and practices to the tasks of analysing, \nevaluating, controlling and communicating about risk issues.Salt-water intrusion: \nDisplacement of fresh surface water or groundwater by the advance of salt water due to its greater \ndensity. This usually occurs in coastal and estuarine areas due to \n\n\n\nand associated groundwater recharge, or from excessive water \n\n\nrelative sea-level rise).Storm surge: Generally used to refer to a temporary increase, at a particular locality, in the height of the sea due to extreme \n\nmeteorological conditions (low atmospheric pressure and/or \n\n\nabove the level expected from the tidal variation alone at that \ntime and place.

Vulnerability is a \n\nfunction of the character, magnitude, and rate of climate change \n\nand variation to which a system is exposed, its sensitivity, and \n\nits adaptive capacity.\n', 'MUNICIPA\nL CLIMAT\nE CHANGE ACTION PLAN5 CANADA-NOVA SCOTIA INFRASTRU\nCTURE SECRETA\nRIAT\nWhat is Adaptation to Climate Change?\nAdapting to climate change involves undertaking actions and \nthe harmful consequences of changing climate. Conversely, \n\nadaptive actions can also be designed to take advantage of \nany potential long-term opportunities that come with changes \nin local and regional climate. For example, a longer growing \nseason in agricultural areas of the province. Adaptation is built on the premise that appropriate actions are undertaken before major impacts occur or shortly after they \ntake place, so that similar damage in the future is anticipated \nand minimized. Both of these types of adaptation responses can \nbe planned in advance. In most cases, planned adaptation will \nincur lower long-term costs and is seen to be far more effective \n\nthan simply reacting to climate change in an unplanned, ad-hoc \nmanner.\nAdaptation at the municipal level also involves new ways of thinking about infrastructure design, renewal and maintenance. \nIt involves adaptive land-use planning and neighbourhood \ndesign and also adaptive water and energy management, in \n\naddition to other adaptive measures that will help to ensure that \nour communities are prepared and will be resilient.Determining \nVulnerability & Managing \nRiskThe measure of how sensitive certain elements of a municipality \nor community are to climate change impacts is often known \nas vulnerability. The overall vulnerability of a community to \n\nclimate change will vary between one community and another. \n\nIn other words, a variety of factors and variables dictate \nvulnerability. For example, communities located within close \n\nproximity to the coast or watercourses are more susceptible to \nstorm surges than inland communities which are more sheltered. \n\nCoastal communities are therefore, more vulnerable (at greater \nrisk) because their location makes them susceptible to shoreline \nHow Can Municipalities Adapt?\nVulnerability can be reduced through the careful implementation \n\nof adaptive management practices, actions, policies and \n\nnegative impacts. For example, identifying vulnerable \ninfrastructure, incorporating adaptive planning into land-use \npolicies, revising emergency response measures, and accounting \n\nfor sea-level rise when planning and building new infrastructure \nwill serve to protect new developments, private property, \n\nmunicipal capital investments, as well as the environment. Municipalities can also adapt by considering the vulnerability \nof their services and the supporting infrastructure. For example, \nwater treatment facilities and water distribution systems provide \nsafe drinking water. Sewage treatment facilities and distribution \n\nsystems collect and treat waste. Adaptive planning takes these \n\nconsiderations into account by developing measures which \nensure that important services continue to operate during, or \nfollowing extreme weather events. Other effective adaptation measures include: managing \n\n\npreventing construction in areas of known vulnerability.\nThere is little doubt that climate change will affect a broad range \nof municipal assets and local government services, in addition \nto municipal operations and policy decisions. Climate change \nadaptation is a matter of risk management and good governance; \nand at the local government level, there are several key areas of \nA. Licensing and Regulation \nŒ Municipalities can use \ntheir powers to set the local regulatory environment in \nconjunction with their ability to enforce regulations, to \nimplement and enforce adaptive policies.B.\n Facilitation, Advocacy, Leadership and \n Public Education \nŒ Municipalities can use their close \ncontact and relationship with community organizations, \n\nbusinesses, residents and other stakeholders at the local \nlevel, to develop a shared understanding of the issues  and to develop collaborative responses to climate  change.C. Service Delivery, Community Development and \nCivic Engagement\n Œ Many of the services provided \nby municipalities for businesses and residents can be \nreviewed in light of adaptive climate change initiatives. What Are Municipalities Adapting To?\n\nclimate change is happening and human activities are the \nprincipal cause. The ability for communities to adapt and \n\neffectively respond to these challenges now ranks alongside \n\nother pressing environmental, social and economic imperatives \naffecting municipalities.  \nPA\nRT TW\nO  \n Climate Change Adaptation\n', '6 CANADA-NOVA SCOTIA INFRASTRU\nCTURE SECRETA\nRIAT\nIt is now widely accepted that a warming world will be accompanied by changes in the intensity, frequency, duration and \n\ngeographic extent of weather and climatic extremes. Changes in \nclimate and weather extremes are already observed to be having \nan impact on communities throughout Nova Scotia. There is \n\nlittle doubt that future changes will present additional challenges \nto municipalities. In addition to extreme weather, climate change \n\nis also linked to sea-level rise, which will have long-term \nplanning implications for coastal areas of the province.

Often the focus of these uncertainties lies with \nuncertain future climate conditions. However, past and current \n\nclimate trends and impacts do give us some indication of what \nwe might anticipate in the future and who and what places might \nbe most vulnerable.There is a temptation for those faced with issues of climate change at the local level, to focus attention on more pressing \nmatters, however, it is at the municipal and community level \n\nwhere practical knowledge and experience can be drawn from, \nand where adaptation will begin.

This change in sea level will occur due to the thermal \n\nexpansion of seawater and the melting of glaciers and ice \ncaps. On a regional level sea level increases will depend on a \nvariety of factors such as the local coastline variations, changes \nto currents, vertical land movements, and differences in tidal \n\npatterns.According to a report completed by the Geological Survey of Canada in 1998, approximately 80% of the Atlantic Region™s \n\ncoastline is considered to be highly sensitive to global sea level \n\n\neven greater risk as a result of sea-level rise.

In general, the range of potential impacts and \nhazards associated with climate and weather varies on a local \nand regional scale, and in turn, will vary from municipality to \nmunicipality. \nClimate change becomes an issue for the municipality when it directly impacts the community. For example, a storm surge \n\nalong undeveloped portions of a coastline is for the most part, \nnot a pressing issue for the municipality. However, when a \n\nstorm surge damages buildings or impacts infrastructure or other \n\nvital elements of the community, it becomes an issue for the \n\nmunicipality that requires attention, and management through \nadaptation. Particularly if it becomes evident that another similar \nevent will take place in the future. Coastal erosion, for example, will affect some municipalities \nmore than others, due to variability in factors like the underlying \n\nlocation of development and infrastructure. Municipalities that \nare directly affected by coastal erosion will be concerned with \n\n\nthe potential to harm public safety, infrastructure or economic \n\nelements that are important to the long-term viability of the \ncommunity. \nExtreme storm events provide another good example that demonstrates how climate impacts can vary between \nmunicipalities. Increased runoff resulting from heavy rainfall \n\ncan impact municipalities with extensive wastewater treatment \ninfrastructure. Unforeseen consequences can occur when an \nincrease in water volume exceeds the design capacity of the \nfacility. Operating at full capacity can cause a number of issues \n\nsuch as: increased wear-and-tear on moving parts, the discharge \n\nof inadequately treated wastewater in receiving waters, the \npotential contamination of nearby drinking water supplies, \n\n\nAdaptation for municipalities with this type of infrastructure \nwill involve reviewing the design capacity of the existing system \nand integrating changes which accommodate the new weather \nregime, during maintenance and infrastructure renewal.Municipalities without wastewater and drinking water infrastructure do not have to worry about these kinds of issues; \nhowever, other issues of concern might result from heavy \n\n\nimpact communities by limiting or restricting access to local \nroads.

These are \n\nissues, which if left unmanaged, could cause problems (over the \nshort to long-term) for public safety, municipal infrastructure, \n\nor harm other aspects of the community. Step Six is a starting \n\npoint for taking action. During Step Six, the committee will \nestablish priorities for municipal action, and start the process of \ndetermining what methods (actions) might be undertaken by the \nmunicipality to reduce risk. Generally, more immediate concerns will have a higher priority, \n\nwhile long-term changes and concerns often take a lower \npriority. Issues or hazards impacting public safety or the delivery \n\nof services should be high on the list of priorities, while those \nwhich are less-immediate (and can be dealt with over time) \nwill tend to have a lower priority. The ways and means by \n\nwhich your committee determines priorities will be based on a \nnumber of variables which will be unique to each municipality. \n\nPrioritization should be supported by sound reasoning that is \ndocumented in the plan.

Municipal Planning Strategies (MPS) are the primary vehicle for articulating a community™s vision on sustainability and overall \n\nplanning policy direction. Municipalities with a Municipal \nPlanning Strategy and Land Use Bylaw (LUB) are required to \nprovide information in Step Six of the MCCAP guide outlining \n\ncouncil™s adaptation priorities with respect to land-use planning \n\nand, in particular for new development.

The inevitable consequence of all this growth is \n\nan increase in greenhouse gas emissions, leading to a rise in \naverage global temperature, the disruption of climate patterns \nand the irreversible alteration of the ecological balance of our \nplanet. The effects of climate change are pervasive, and left \n\nunchecked, could have both severe and indiscriminate impacts \non our social and economic systems. reducing carbon emissions by conducting an inventory of GHG \nemissions. This work has shown that electrical generation, \n\ntransportation and the combustion of heating fuels, account \nfor up to 95 per cent of a community™s direct GHG emissions. \n\nThe remainder comes from the management and disposal of \nmunicipal waste and the emissions from certain industrial \nprocesses, such as cement production, steel making and \nchemical processing. This statistical breakdown varies from \n\none municipality to the next, depending on a number of factors \nincluding the mix of heating fuels, the availability of public \ntransit, and the source of their electrical power. \nA well-designed mitigation plan will help to reduce GHG \nemissions and also has the potential to spur technological \nadvances, create new sources of employment and stimulate the \neconomic growth needed to propel communities forward into a \nmore sustainable future. Building on Existing Mitigation Efforts\nSNSMR recognizes that many of the province™s municipalities \n\nwill have already completed some of the required elements \nfor the mitigation component of the MCCAP. Although this \n\nwork has been completed your municipality will be asked to \nsupply this information to SNSMR in the format outlined in the \nMitigation Plan Template, found in Appendix A.\nMunicipal \nRequirements for Mitigation\nThe purpose of developing a municipal mitigation plan is to start \nthe process of identifying where and how municipal facilities, \ninfrastructure and operations produce emissions, and to develop \nan approach to reducing emissions over time. Ultimately this \nwill result in cleaner air for all Nova Scotians. To achieve this \n\npurpose the mitigation component will focus only on corporate \n(municipal) greenhouse gas emissions. In order to assist municipalities prepare their mitigation action plan SNSMR has partnered with the UNSM and Stantec, and \nhave developed a Municipal Climate Change Mitigation Plan \nWorkbook that will also be of assistance when undertaking this \n\npart of the MCCAP. The workbook provides all the information \n\nnecessary to prepare a comprehensive mitigation plan, complete \nwith reduction targets and detailed actions, and can be used as \n\nsuch by municipalities. Those municipalities wishing to develop \n\na comprehensive mitigation plan are strongly encouraged to \nwork through the workbook which is available on-line and can \nbe downloaded from the UNSM webpage. It should be noted that the mandatory requirement for the mitigation component of the MCCAP is described in Steps One \n\nto Three (see below) and also in the submission template in \n\nAppendix A.Preparing a Corporate Mitigation Plan\n There are three mandatory steps required for the mitigation \ncomponent of the MCCAP. \nStep One:\n Collect \nEnergy & \nEmissions Information\nStep Two:\n  Complete \nEnergy & \nEmissions \nInventory Table\nStep Three:\n Set Goals & \nIdentifying Actions for \nMitigation\nPA\nRT THREE  \n Climate Change Mitigation\n', '22 CANADA-NOVA SCOTIA INFRASTRU\nCTURE SECRETA\nRIAT\nStep One:  \n E\nnergy & \nEmissions Information\nStep One: Objective\n\nSpreadsheetCorporate Energy & Emissions Spreadsheet\n\nMunicipalities that have not already conducted an energy and \n\nemissions inventory must use the Corporate and Emissions \nSpreadsheet and User Guide, developed by the UNSM and \ndownloadable at: \nhttp://www.sustainability-unsm.ca/our-work.html  \nIt is recommended that you also download the instruction manual and additional information provided in order to assist \nyou in completing the spreadsheet.
