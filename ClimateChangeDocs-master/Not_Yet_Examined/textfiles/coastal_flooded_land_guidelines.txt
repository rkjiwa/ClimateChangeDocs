Recent and future sea level rise is now \nunderstood to be occurring at faster rates and in the \nfuture is anticipated to be rising at a rate that \nis approximately 10 times faster than the historical rate. \nThis document provides guidelines intended to help local governments, land-use managers and \napproving officers develop and implement land\n-use management plans and make subdivision \napproval decisions for lands exposed to coasta\nl flooding hazards and Sea Level Rise (SLR). \nThe Sea Level Rise (SLR) projec\ntions and potential responses considered in this document are \ndrawn from the \nPolicy Discussion Paper 2010\n1. Current BC guidelines require flood-proofing behind dikes (i.e. raising the habitable areas of \nbuildings to the Flood Construction Level); however, where sea dikes are upgraded to new design \n\nguidelines, as defined in the companion document \nﬁSea Dike Guidelines 2010ﬂ\n 2, relaxation of flood-proofing guidelines may be considered. The \nrelaxed flood-proofing must be compatible with \nthe design of the sea dikes. \nThis document, and the companion document \nﬁSea Dike Guidelines 2010ﬂ\n 2 are specific to flood \nhazards arising from the exposure of BC lands to \nthe sea. In some locati\nons, specifically river \nestuaries, the lands will also be exposed to ot\nher sources of flooding. These new documents are \ncompanion documents to the existing guidelin\ne documents which still address flooding hazards \nfrom rivers.  Analysis of flooding hazards from a\nll sources Œ rivers and the sea - will be required in \nestuaries.  \n1.2 Acknowledgment \nPreparation of this document and its companion documents was made possible through funding by \nNatural Resources Canada™s Regional Adaptation Co\nllaborative program and administration by the \nFraser Basin Council.  \n                                                     \n 1 Draft Policy Discussion Paper - Climate Change Adaptation Guidelines for Sea Dikes  and Coastal Flood \nHazard Land Use in BC.

This document is intended to pr\novide guidance for coastal exposure in British \nColumbia. \n2.3 Definitions \nA summary of definitions and terminology used in\n this document is provided in Appendix A. \nWhere possible the same terminology and definitions as used in the existing document; \nLand Use \nGuidelines 2004\n3 are used; however, as the existing term\ninology and definitions sometimes need \nmodification, clarification or expansion to be appropriate for coastal conditions, in some cases new \nor revised terminology and definitions are prop\nosed.  It is recommended that the reader of the \nupdated documents familiarize themselves with\n the updated terminology and definitions in \nAppendix A as necessary. \n2.4 Updated Definitions \nIn the existing documents the definition of t\nhe management parameters; Flood Construction Level \n(FCL) and Setback, is based on the defined location \nof the Natural Boundary Œ a position defined in \nlaw, and in the existing definitions, but which has a tenuous technical basis. The Natural Boundary \nis a position that can be identified on an existing \nshoreline as indicated in Figure 2-1. It is not \npossible to identify the Natural Boundary for a fu\nture higher water level. Further background and \ndiscussion is provided in Appendix B. \nA brief summary of necessary changes is prov\nided below and is summarized in Figure 2-2. \nIn general terms the reference point for the \nFCL and for the Setback becomes centred on an \nestimated location for a future Natural Boundary, the \nlocation of which will change over time as sea \nlevel rises.  The reference point can be estimated by defining: \n1. The Designated Flood Level (as indicated in Figure 2-2) \n2. An estimated future Natural Boundary location (as indicated in Figure 2-2): \nThe Designated Flood Level is defined as: \n Designated Flood Level (DFL) \n= Future SLR Allowance \n + Maximum High Tide (HHWLT) \n + Total Storm Surge during Designated Storm \n                                                     \n 3 ﬁLand Use Guidelines 2004ﬂ \nmeans the Flood Hazard Area Land Use Management Guidelines, May 2004, \nprepared by the Ministry of Water, Land and Air Protection. \n', ' Rev: 0 \nDate: 27 January 2011 \n\nProject No:  143111:  BC Ministry of Environment/ Climate Change Adaption Guidelines for Sea Dikes and Coastal Flood Hazard Lan\nd Use 3 \nThe expected location of the future Natural Boundary is then defined by estimating the additional \ninfluence of waves and their effect on the slowly\n changing shoreline.  The elevation of this \nreference point, defined as the Flood Construction Reference Plane (FCRP), Figure 2-2, is defined \n\nas: \nFlood Construction Reference Plane\n (FCRP) \n= Designated Flood Level (DFL) \n + Estimated Wave Effect \n\n The Estimated Wave Effect can be defined to be 50 per cent of the calculated Wave Run-up on the \nestimated future shoreline.  This percentage is\n based on an analysis of existing data (2010), \ndescribed below, and may be revised as more info\nrmation, including site specific surveys or \ndetailed engineering investigations undertaken by \nqualified professionals, becomes available. \nThe role of the existing legal Natural Boundary is preserved for defining the Sea Level Planning \nArea, as also indicated in Figure 2-2. \nThe Flood Construction Level (FCL), which will \nalso vary for a both a given target year, and a \nspecific area, is defined as: \n Flood Construction Level\n = FCRP + Freeboard \n The Freeboard allowance should be the greater of: \n 0.6m, or; \n For flood proofing fill Œ the crest elevation of \nan equivalent sea dike (see Sea Dike Guidelines \n2010) \n For exposed vertical building foundations Œ the wave-structure interaction; \n For tsunami areas Œ the runup elevati\non of the appropriate tsunami hazard. \n \nSetbacks remain essentially unchanged. \n\nFurther details of the basis and relationship between the Existing Definitions and the Updated \nDefinitions are provided in Appendix B.  \n \n  ', ' Rev: 0 \nDate: 27 January 2011 \n\nProject No:  143111:  BC Ministry of Environment/ Climate Change Adaption Guidelines for Sea Dikes and Coastal Flood Hazard Lan\nd Use 4 \n Figure 2-1: Existing Definitions for FCL and Setback \n  Figure 2-2: Definitions for Updated FCL and Setbacks \n', ' Rev: 0 \nDate: 27 January 2011 \n\nProject No:  143111:  BC Ministry of Environment/ Climate Change Adaption Guidelines for Sea Dikes and Coastal Flood Hazard Lan\nd Use 5 \n3 Climate Change Impacts on Coastal Land Use Management \nThis section is a summary of more detailed information provided in the companion \nPolicy \nDiscussion Paper 2010\n1, and provides a background for management of land use, building \nelevations and related planning and approvals proces\nses in areas that are at risk of flooding from \nthe sea. \n3.1 Incremental Sea Level Rise \nSea Level Rise is predicted to be moderate in t\nhe period from 2010 to 2025. However, the rate is \npredicted to increase more quickly in the period \nleading up to 2100, and then continue to increase \nsteadily.  For the purpose of this document the curr\nent definition of the expected Sea Level Rise is \nprovided in Figure 3-1.  The basis for this \ndefinition is provided in the policy document: \nPolicy \nDiscussion Paper 2010\n1.    Figure 3-1: Projections of Global Sea Level Rise\n  Figure 3-1 illustrates the range of \nuncertainty in projections, showing a median projection, as well \nas a range in projections from low to high. The uncertainty increases into the future. To protect the \n\nlarge investment that buildings involve, and re\nspecting current trends in SLR, a precautionary \nprinciple is followed to create the Recommended Curve for Sea Level Rise Policy in BC.  As new \nSLR predictions become available with more accuracy, allowances for SLR in coastal BC areas \n\nmay be adjusted, up or down, reflected in a change to these guidelines in the future. \nThe combination of certain sea level change - but \nat an uncertain rate into the future - creates \ncomplexity for the determination of Designated Fl\nood Level (DFL) and related Flood Construction \nLevel (FCL). \n', ' Rev: 0 \nDate: 27 January 2011 \n\nProject No:  143111:  BC Ministry of Environment/ Climate Change Adaption Guidelines for Sea Dikes and Coastal Flood Hazard Lan\nd Use 6 \nBoth DFL and FCL will need to change over time as sea level rise continues. The pace of sea level \nrise and the arrival of more accurate projections w\nill inform how often a revision to FCLs needs to \ntake place. Given current informat\nion, a review in five years, and then again by 2025, as well as at \nleast once every 25 years thereafter, is warranted. \n3.2 Building Life Cycle and Sea Level Rise \nIn considering FCL in the face of an evolving sea level, it is necessary to consider the longevity of \nthe buildings, structures or land use under consider\nation. A range of 50 to 100 years of practical \nservice life is expected for most buildings, although some building life may extend well beyond that \nlifespan. Given the prospect of rising sea level, it \nis necessary to establish a FCL that anticipates a \nflood level applicable to the end of the lifespan of the proposed building. \nFigure 3-2 illustrates how planning for the 100 year lifes\npan of a structure or land use brings future \nSLR increases into immediate focus. The graphic illustrates, in 100 year steps, how building \n\nelevations may need to be incrementally adjusted higher to accommodate gradual SLR. \n Figure 3-2: Incremental Sea Level Rise Effect\n on Planning for 100 Year Life Structures \n For land use management guidance in BC, allowances for Sea Level Rise until the Year 2100 \nshould be used in current planning and building approvals. \nThis guideline should apply for the period from \n2010 until the next SLR review, which should be \ncompleted by 2015. \nFigure 3-2 shows how high SLR projections could \naffect a building that has an expected lifespan \nextending to the Year 2100. An allowance of 1.0 \nm of SLR plus or minus regional effects (e.g. \ncrustal uplift or subsidence) could be required. Fi\ngure 3-2 also extends the allowance out to the \nYear 2200, indicating that an additional SLR of \napproximately 1.0 m, for a total allowance of \napproximately 2.0 m, can be expe\ncted over the 200 year period. \nSLR over the next centuries will continue to increase the pressure for ever higher building \nelevations to adapt to the risk of flooding from the sea. \n ', ' Rev: 0 \nDate: 27 January 2011 \n\nProject No:  143111:  BC Ministry of Environment/ Climate Change Adaption Guidelines for Sea Dikes and Coastal Flood Hazard Lan\nd Use 7 \n  \n 3.3 Sea Level Rise and Building Flood Construction Level \nIn coastal areas, calculation of the Flood Construction Reference Plane (FCRP) and a Flood \nConstruction Level (FCL) that reflects expected SLR is complex, and will vary depending on the \n\nlocal tide conditions, shoreline orientation and expo\nsure and other factors that change allowances \nfor local storm surge and wave effects. \nAn example of the calculation of the FCL for \nan exposed location at Victoria, where a recent \nsurveyed elevation of a present Natural Boundary is \navailable, is provided in Table 3-1, based on \nthe existing guidelines; \nLand Use Guidelines 2004\n3, and for these updated guidelines, for \napplication up to the years 2100 and 2200.  \n ‚Guideline™ provides recommended values for current planning for the BC Coast for the indicated \nyears as indicated in Figure 3-1. ‚\nPossible™ represents the highest potential values as defined in \nthe companion ﬁ\nPolicy Discussion Paper 2010\nﬂ1 and indicated by the upper envelope curve in \nFigure 3-1.  The ﬁ\nPossible\nﬂ scenario is only included to illustra\nte the potential implication of the \npresent upper bound of all global scenarios. \nThe updated estimate for 2010 in Table 3-1 shows th\nat the change from rely\ning on the elevation of \nthe present Natural Boundary to one which is based on expected water levels makes no significant \ndifference to the estimation of a FCL for 2010.  The results in Table 3-1 also show that planning \ntoday for a FCL of 5.9 m CGD essentially means \nthat anticipation of an extreme SLR by 2100 \nsimply provides an allowance that may provide \nprotection until the year 2200, depending on actual \nSLR. Table 3-2 provides preliminary FCRPs and FCLs fo\nr various areas of the BC coast for the year \n2100, based on the Recommended Sea Level Rise Cu\nrve in Figure 3-1 and annual exceedence \nprobabilities (AEP) \ndefined in the co\nmpanion document \nPolicy Discussion Paper 2010\n1.  It should \nbe noted that these preliminary values should vary du\ne to a number of factors that are site specific, \nincluding: the local rate of crustal uplift or su\nbsidence, the nature of the tides, anticipated local \nstorm surge effects that depend on local bathymetr\ny and the particulars of \nthe anticipated storms \nassociated with the storm surge. \n The preliminary values provided in Table 3-2 are provided for \nguidance.  Further analysis is required to provide FCRPs and FCLs for specific sites. \nSLR Planning Areas\n should be established along the BC Coast to provide a basis for local \ncalculations and guidance on required Flood Cons\ntruction Levels, and to provide a basis for \nmanagement of the expected ongoing increases in\n SLR as it affects land use and buildings. \nProposed terms of reference for SLR Planning Areas are introduced in Section 4 \n', ' Rev: 0 \nDate: 27 January 2011 \n\nProject No:  143111:  BC Ministry of Environment/ Climate Change Adaption Guidelines for Sea Dikes and Coastal Flood Hazard Lan\nd Use 8 \nTable 3-1:  Example Calculation of\n Coastal Flood Construction Level \nLocation: Exposed Waterfront - Victoria\n  Existing \n(2010) \nUpdated \n(2010) \n2100 \n2200 \nRegional SLR \nAllowance\n 1  (above 2000 level) \n0 m 0 m Guideline\n Possible 6 Guideline \nPossible 6 0.88 m \n1.88 m \n1.76 m \n3.16 m \nHigh Tide \n(HHWLT) \n2 Existing \nDefinition \nimplicitly \nmerges these all \ntogether to equal: \nElevation \nof the Natural \nBoundary  \n+ 1.5 m \nSurvey \ndata from Victoria Waterfront shows \nelevation \nof the Natural \nBoundary \n 2.5 m CGD 1.5 m CGD Surge Allowance \n3 1.3 m Wave Effect Allowance \n4 0.65 m \nFreeboard \n5 0.6 m Flood \nConstruction \nLevel (FCL) \n4.0 m CGD 4.05 m CGD 4.9 m CGD \n5.9 m CGD \n5.8 m CGD \n7.2 m CGD \n1 Estimate based on Recommended Sea Level\n Rise in Figure 3-1 and an uplift rate of 1.2 mm/yr for Victoria \n2 Varies by site and location in BC, as defined \nin Tide Tables, Volume 5, CHS for Victoria \n3 Recommended value for a 1/500 yr AEP based on ﬁ\nPolicy Discussion Paper 2010\n1ﬂ and assuming the Total \nStorm Surge equals the Storm Surge in deepwater.  \n4 Based on wave runup on natural \ngravel Œ pebble beach shoreline. \n5Assumes no Flood Proofing. \n6 Potential SLR levels at the High range of projections from scientific authorities. \n  ', ' Rev: 0 \nDate: 27 January 2011 \n\nProject No:  143111:  BC Ministry of Environment/ Climate Change Adaption Guidelines for Sea Dikes and Coastal Flood Hazard Lan\nd Use 9 \nTable 3-2: Preliminary Flood Construction Reference Plane (FCRP) and FCL for 2100 for \nSpecific Areas in Coas\ntal British Columbia \nElevations relative to CGD\n  Fraser \nRiver \nDelta \nVancouver \nHarbour \nSquamish \nRiver Delta \nEast Vancouver \nIsland \nWest \nVancouver \nIsland \nCentral and \nNorth Coast Global SLR \nAllowance  \n 1.0 m Regional \nAdjustment 1 +0.21 m \n0 m 0 m -0.17 m \n-0.27 m \n-0.22 m \nHigh Tide \n2  (HHWLT   m CGD) \n 2.0 m 1.9 m 2.05 m \n1.6 m 2.0 m 3.8 m Surge Allowance \n3 1.7 m 1.4 m 1.3 m 1.3 m 1.3 m 1.7 m Wave Effect Allowance \n4 0.65 m \n0.65 m \n0.65 m \n0.65 m \n0.65 m \n0.65 m \nFlood \nConstruction \nReference Plane \n(FCRP) 5.6 m  5.0 m  5.0 m  4.4 m  4.7 m  6.9 m  Freeboard \n5 0.6 m 0.6 m 0.6 m 0.6 m 0.6 m 0.6 m Flood \nConstruction \nLevel (FCL) \n6.2 m  5.6 m  5.6 m  5.0 m  5.3 m  7.5 m  1 Based on current values for areas (Vancouver and Squam\nish taken to be neutral due to regional variations or \npresent lack of site specific data) 2 Varies by site and location in BC, as defined by CHS\n Tide Tables for areas, Œ Cowichan Bay used for East \nVancouver Island Œ Tofino used for We\nst Vancouver Island - Queen Charlotte City used for Central and North \nCoast. 3 Recommended value for AEP based on ﬁPolicy Discussion P\naper 2010ﬂ Œ includes allowances for local wind \nsetup. 4 Based on wave runup on natural gr\navel Œ pebble beach shoreline. \n5 Assumes no Flood Proofing, specific \nBuilding Foundation type, or Tsunami. \n  3.4 Adaptive Risk Management in the Face of Uncertainty \nTo provide balance between economic development \nobjectives and the precautionary principle, an \nAdaptive Risk Management approach to Sea Level Rise is warranted.  \nLand use and building approvals based on FCL for 2100 should also include provisions for \nadaptive management of land uses to Sea Level Rise to the Year 2200 and beyond. The long term \nview should also apply when approval of a lot parc\nel or a building implies a change (increase) in \nthe intensity of land use that extends beyond the life of building. \nAn Adaptive Risk Management Approach to SLR would plan how short term land uses and \nstructures can be occupied with reasonable risk fo\nr their lifespan, but at the same time recognize \nand allow that future SLR may require the redesign \nto a higher elevation or relocation of the next \ngeneration of land uses and structures at a given coastal site.  \n', ' Rev: 0 \nDate: 27 January 2011 \n\nProject No:  143111:  BC Ministry of Environment/ Climate Change Adaption Guidelines for Sea Dikes and Coastal Flood Hazard Lan\nd Use 10 \nThe FCL and Setback for a given site may vary at the point that a building has ended its planned \nlifespan.  \nFor example, a building constructed in 2010 with\n a 90 year lifespan would meet the guideline if \nsited to allow for SLR of 1.0 m minimum over \nYear 2000 levels plus or minus any regional \nadjustments. When rebuilt in or about 2100 this building would need to accommodate FCL at the \ntime, which might be 2.0m higher than Year 2000 \nlevels, requiring that the building FCL be 1.0 m \nhigher than approved in 2010. The actual required FCL in the year 2200 will not be known with \naccuracy until much closer to that date. \nIn the building example above, there is ongoing \neconomic use, with the costs of adaptation \ndistributed through the centuries. \nThis approach will minimize the in\nitial costs of consider\ning SLR, and the future costs of adaptation. Beyond examples of individual buildings, the SLR Planning Area approach described in Section 4 \nprovides a method to gradually adapt larger scale land use patterns to SLR including impacts on \ndrainage, access and other factors affecting the land use. \n', ' Rev: 0 \nDate: 27 January 2011 \n\nProject No:  143111:  BC Ministry of Environment/ Climate Change Adaption Guidelines for Sea Dikes and Coastal Flood Hazard Lan\nd Use 11 \n4 Sea Level Rise (SLR) Planning Areas \nSLR creates serious risks for public health and property in lowlands on the BC coast. It is \nnecessary to minimize the risk and costs of SLR, \nto both public and private interests, by proactive \nplanning for future land use. SLR Planning Areas should be defined for both settled and new \ndevelopment areas that are at risk of \nSLR inundation or related erosion.  \n4.1 Extent of SLR Planning Area \nThis section describes how to determine the ex\ntent of SLR Planning Areas, and introduces the \nproposed scope of planning. \nFigure 4-1 illustrates in concept the proposed \nSLR Planning Areas. They would extend from the \nexisting Natural Boundary of the sea landward \nto the contour elevation of a future Flood \nConstruction Level (FCL). Each SLR Planning Area would have two parts: \n SLR Planning Area Year 2100 would extend from Natural Boundary at the sea to the guideline \nFCL elevation projected for Year 2100. \n SLR Planning Area Year 2200 would extend from Natural Boundary at the sea to the guideline \nFCL elevation projected for Year 2200. \nFor the purposes of determining the extent of \nSLR Planning Areas, the presence of existing sea \ndikes or coastal defences should be ignored.  Ho\nwever, if the Management Option selected for the \nArea is to protect the Area in perpetuity with se\na dikes, then the design of the dikes should be \nconsidered in the determination of appropriate FCLs.  Land use policies must then address the \nland needs required to upgrade the existing sea dikes. \nFlood Construction Levels for SLR Planning Areas \nshould be calculated specific to the local \nconditions of shoreline terrain and vegetati\non, tides, wind fetch and upland topography.

With assistance by Qualified \nProfessionals, it is appropriate to consider whet\nher these shorter lifespans could be considered for \nreduced approval requirements. However, approvin\ng officials are cautioned in these cases to \nensure that proponents plan and covenant for adapt\nation of the next generation of buildings and \nland uses on the site to SLR at the Year 2100 an\nd Year 2200 or other appropriate thresholds. \nIt is recommended that SLR projections and related FCL requirements should be reviewed in 5 \nyears time (Year 2015) as well as Year 2025 and every 25 years after that at a minimum. The \nguidelines and requirements in SLR Planning Areas will need to be reviewed in these same \n\nintervals, with a focus on updating FCL elevatio\nn requirements, which may move up or down as \nprojections for SLR become more accurate. \nThe term of SLR Plans will also move with the review intervals Œ with the general intent that SLR \nplanning looks ahead approximately 100 and 200 years fr\nom the date of the plan. For example, in \nthe Year 2050 the SLR Planning Area boundaries (FCL contours) may reflect Years 2150 and \n2250. \n4.3 Building Setbacks from the Sea \nIn un-diked areas, SLR will have the long-term \neffect of moving the Natural Boundary landward. \nThis effect will be more pronounced on gently slopi\nng shorelines or low coastal benches than in \nsteeper shoreline terrain or where bedrock is \npresent.  Coastal Bluffs will require special \nconsideration. \nSea Level Rise may increase the risk of coastal \nerosion and accelerate the retreat of shorelines. \nHigher risks will occur on sandy shorelines, with mo\nderate risks at gravel or estuarine settings. The \nchanges in risk will relate to increased frequency of wave action at shorelines and at the toe of \n\nrelated slopes or bluffs. The rate of retreat will be highly dependent on the wind and wave \ncharacteristics at the site and the materi\nal of the shoreline and backshore bluffs. \nWhere lands are to remain un-diked, setbacks for \nbuildings from the sea must anticipate SLR for \nthe lifespan of the building. \nFigure 4-4 illustrates SLR to the Year 2100 in a re\nlatively flat and rolling shoreline condition. SLR \nwill increase the elevation of High Tide, and with\n storm surge, wave effects and freeboard added, \nthe cumulative effect is to increase the Flood Construction Level (FCL) by an amount related to \nSLR and the local storm exposure. This increase in sea level and wave runup will gradually move \nthe Natural Boundary to a higher level. \nBuilding Setback should be established as ‚\nthe greater of 15 m from the future Estimated \nNatural Boundary or a distance to where the native land elevation equals the Flood \nConstruction Level™. \nThis setback would apply to non-erodib\nle bedrock cliffs as well as other \nshoreline types. In cases of coastal bluffs, great\ner setbacks would apply, consistent with the \nLand \nUse Guidelines 2004.\n  ', ' Rev: 0 \nDate: 27 January 2011 \n\nProject No:  143111:  BC Ministry of Environment/ Climate Change Adaption Guidelines for Sea Dikes and Coastal Flood Hazard Lan\nd Use 15 \nIn Figure 4-4, the steep future shoreline mean\ns that the 15m minimum setback from Natural \nBoundary supersedes the FC\nL contour elevation. \nIn Figure 4-5, which illustrates the Year 2200 projected condition, additional SLR has moved the \nfuture Natural Boundary further inland, and combined with the increase in FCL has made the \nbuilding constructed in 2010 not fully protected from\n the sea. The building is also likely to be at the \nend of its lifespan around 2100. Rebuilding on or after 2100 should undertake a MANAGED \n\nRETREAT, and respect the Year 2200 FCL and Setback. \nIf rebuilding is not proposed, the building will be at \nrisk. Short of relocating \nthe building, preparing \nthe lower parts of the building to ACCOMODATE\n flooding from the sea should be required Œ \nthrough such measures as leaving only floodable uses such as parking on the lower floor, moving \nhabitable quarters to the upper floor, or using wa\nter resistant materials on the lower floor. \n  Figure 4-4: Concept Section of SLR Planning Area Yr 2100 \n ', ' Rev: 0 \nDate: 27 January 2011 \n\nProject No:  143111:  BC Ministry of Environment/ Climate Change Adaption Guidelines for Sea Dikes and Coastal Flood Hazard Lan\nd Use 16 \n  Figure 4-5: Concept Section of SLR Planning Area Yr 2200 \n 4.4 Land Use Planning Strategies  \nBeyond concerns about individual buildings, the long\n-term nature of SLR provides an opportunity to \nminimize risks and impacts by land use planning strategies. \nDuring planning for land use and development, careful mapping and planning strategies for SLR \nPlanning Areas will minimize costs and hazards\n for both the public and \nprivate landowners / \ninsurers. \nFigure 4-6 introduces in plan view, the concept t\nhat a SLR Planning Area extent varies with \nshoreline and backshore terrain. Where shorelines are relatively steep and rocky, typical of \n\nbedrock points of land, the minimum 15m setbac\nk combined with a steep slope would mean the \nareal extent of SLR will be limited. In shoreline \nareas where gentle beaches\n, beach dunes and flat or rolling backshores exist, SLR impact could a\nffect a considerable land area. A first step in land \nuse planning for SLR is to establish the future \nFCL allowances for Year 2100 and 2200, and map \nthe associated FCL lines on deta\niled contour maps. The SLR Planni\nng Area lines will be, in effect, \ncontour lines representing allowances for the FCL levels in Year 2100 and Year 2200. \nFigure 4-7 shows typical planning responses, at the l\nand use level, to risks of SLR in areas that will \nnot be diked. An initial response should be to \nconcentrate development outside the SLR Planning \nArea, to AVOID risks associated with SLR. \nIncreases in SLR will gradually move the natural boundary landward. Land use in the area that will \nbe inundated in the future should be managed to adjust to the change in shoreline and to the \n\nincreased risk of sea flooding during the Designated\n Storm. Uses such as agriculture, parks, open \nspace and limited industrial or short-term uses would be preferred. \nIn cases of estuarine or coastal wetlands, the zone of wetlands may tend to move shoreward. \nWhere coastal defences or existing rock geology stop\ns the shoreline from moving, intertidal areas \n', ' Rev: 0 \nDate: 27 January 2011 \n\nProject No:  143111:  BC Ministry of Environment/ Climate Change Adaption Guidelines for Sea Dikes and Coastal Flood Hazard Lan\nd Use 17 \nand their associated ecosystems are at risk of being ‚squeezed out™\n4.  SLR Planning should \nconsider what areas of land should be set aside to allow migration of coastal ecosystems, or to \nsupport ecosystem restoration or habitat banking.  \nSLR Planning Areas, or applicant supported studies \nby Qualified Professionals, should also be \nused to customize building ﬁsetbackﬂ based on co\nastal risk assessments that consider how SLR \ncombined with wave action and coastal geomorphology may alter shoreline locations, shape and \n\nbackshore erosion. Guidelines for location of buildings should be based on these planning studies \nand the expected life of\n the at-risk asset. \nSalinization of surface freshwater and groundwa\nter may also increase in shoreline areas, \npotentially affecting both ecosystems and drinking water supplies from coastal wells. SLR Planning \nshould consider how to mitigate the impacts of\n salinization. Drainage may also be impeded by \nhigher groundwater levels. \nLand managers may decide to PROTECT some parts of a SLR Planning Area by building a new \ndike or placing landfill to meet FCLs. If dikes ar\ne used as protection, such areas must meet the \nrequirements of the ﬁ\nSea Dike Guidelines 2010ﬂ\n.

Note, however, this \nrequirement is not intended to discourage mix\ned land use communities. With new legislative \nsupport, a building lifespan requirement could be an added clause to a Development Permit Area \nor a Zoning Bylaw. Associated with the planned \nstructure lifespan would be a FCL and shoreline \nsetback. A covenant on title would provide legal \nnotice that the FCL and setback rules may change \nfor reconstruction at the end of\n the structure lifespan period. \nHowever, the recommended planning approach is to set FCL based on a precautionary principle \nand a reasonably long building lifespan (i.e.100 year\ns), and then allow those applicants that need \nto challenge these FCLs to commission studies by a \nqualified professional to consider the science \nand site conditions and recommend a site-specifi\nc and structure-specific FCL. This approach is \nsimilar to that used in the BC Riparian Area Regul\nation.  In these cases a covenant on title would \nprovide notice on the allowances and restrictions \non the land use and structure use, and would give \nnotice that future FCL levels may vary depending \non future SLR projections and the lifespan of \nfuture buildings. \nIn the meantime until SLR Planning Areas are defi\nned, local governments could consider adding \nrequirements to development information statutes \nstating that applicants pr\noposing to construct at \nelevations below those outlined in Table 3-2 provid\ne Qualified Professional expertise to determine \nappropriate flood protection in keeping with the 2010\n Guidelines. This would be an interim measure \nonly until more cost-efficient neighbourhood scale SLR Planning could be done. \n4.5 Zoning for Risk \nLand Use Zoning should match land use permissions to the risk of SLR.

These include: \n A time series of atmospheric pressure durin\ng the passage of the storm over the area in \nquestion \n A time series of wind speed and direction dur\ning the passage of the storm over the area \nin question  A time series of wave conditions, including wave heights, periods and directions during \nthe passage of the storm in question.\n 1.6 Diking Authority \n(a) The commissioners of a district to which Part 2 of the Drainage, Ditch and Dike Act\n applies, \n(b) A person owning or controlling a dike other than a private dike, \n(b1)\n If the final agreement of a treaty first nation so \nprovides, the treaty first nation in relation \nto dikes on its treaty lands, \n', ' Appendix A \n3 (c) A public authority designated by the minister \nas having any responsibility for maintenance \nof a dike other than a private dike, or \n(d) A regional district, a municipality or an improvement district. \n1.7 Flood Construction Level (FCL) \nUses the Designated Flood Level plus an allowa\nnce for Freeboard to establish the elevation \nof the underside of a wooden floor system or t\nop of concrete slab for habitable buildings. In \nthe case of a manufactured home, the ground le\nvel or top of concrete or asphalt pad, on \nwhich it is located, shall be equal to or hig\nher than the above described elevation. It also \nestablishes the minimum crest level of a Standard Dike. Where the Designated Flood Level \n\ncannot be determined or where there are overri\nding factors, an assessed height above the \nnatural boundary of the water-body or above th\ne natural ground elevation may be used (as \ndefined in the Land Use Guidelines 2004).  \nIn coastal areas the FCL does not relate to the crest level of a sea dike, nor does it relate to \nthe crest level of flood proofing fill exposed dire\nctly to the designated flood level.  The FCL \ndoes; however, include wave Œ structure interact\nion effects, to be determined at the location \nof the site of the building. \n1.8 Flood Construction Reference Plane (FCRP) \nThe vertical elevation of an estimated future Natural Boundary from which the FCL is \ndetermined. \n1.9 Flood Plain \nA lowland area, whether diked, fl\nood proofed, or not, which, by reasons of land elevation, is \nsusceptible to flooding from an adjoining watercourse, ocean, lake or other body of water and \nfor administration purposes is taken to be \nthat area submerged at the Designated Flood \nLevel. In coastal areas the concept of the Flood Plain has been extended to a ﬁSea Level Rise \nPlanning Areaﬂ; defined below.  Special meas\nures may be warranted in this area. \n1.10 Flood Proofing \nThe alteration of land or structures either \nphysically or in use to reduce flood damage and \nincludes the use of building setbacks from water bodies to maintain a floodway and allow for \n\npotential erosion. Flood Proofing may be achieved by all or a combination of the following: \n Building on fill, provided such \nfill does not interfere with fl\nood flows of the watercourse, \nand is adequately protected against floodwater erosion \n Building raised by structural means such as foundation walls, columns, etc. \n A combination of fill and structural means.\n In coastal areas exposed to flooding, constr\nuction of fill as a flood proofing measure may \nsubstantially increase t\nhe freeboard required to def\nine the FCL, if the fill \nis directly exposed to \nthe Designated Flood Level. In this case, the FC\nL must be equivalent to the crest level of a \nsea dike with the same characteristic\ns as the seaward face of the fill.. 1.11 Freeboard  \nA vertical distance added to the Designated Flood Level. Used to establish the Flood \nConstruction Level.   \n', ' Appendix A \n4 In coastal areas, the vertical distance to be added to a Designated Flood Level is site and \nstructure specific. \n1.12 Natural Boundary \nMeans the visible high watermark of any lake, rive\nr, stream or other body of water where the \npresence and action of the water are so common and usual and so long continued in all \nordinary years as to mark upon the soil of the bed \nof the lake, river, stream or other body of \nwater a character distinct from that of the banks \nthereof, in respect to vegetation, as well as in \nrespect to the nature of the soil itself (Land Act, Section 1).  In addition, the natural boundary \nincludes the best estimate of the edge of dorm\nant or old side channels and marsh areas.  For \ncoastal areas, the natural boundary shall incl\nude the natural limit of permanent terrestrial \nvegetation.  \nNatural Boundary is an established concept in \nBC law Œ and reflects a change in vegetation \nand soil based on effects of the sea. In the\n Flood Hazard Area Land Use Guidelines 2004,\n building setbacks were established from Natural Boundary, on the unstated assumption that \nthe location of Natural Boundary is relatively \nstatic (other than erosions and accretions).  \nNatural boundary is, in practice, often difficult to\n determine in the field or from remote survey. \nIn coastal areas, the Natural Boundary reflects \na snapshot historical record of tide, storm \nsurge and wave runup effects, which may be the ma\nrk of a recent storm in an ordinary year or \nit may be the mark of the most severe storm in \nrecent times.  There is no way of knowing for \ncertain.  A technical basis for the Natural Boundary\n in coastal areas is site and time specific.  \nIn the future the location and elevation of a Natural Boundary will change from time to time \ndue to changes associated with sea level rise and it will likely lag sea level rise.  It is also \nunlikely to immediately reflect the action of t\nhe water, especially the storm surge and waves, \nduring a Designated Storm. \n1.13 Project Life \nThe number of years a particular project; incl\nuding a sea dike, a building or a community, is \nintended to serve before it is replaced, upgra\nded or dismantled.  Regular maintenance to \nensure the project provides the intended pur\npose is expected during the project life. \n1.14 Sea Dike \nA dike, floodwall or any other thing that prevents \nflooding of land by the sea. As defined in the \nDike Maintenance Act, ﬁdikeﬂ means ﬁan embankment, wall, fill, piling, pump, gate, flood box, \npipe, sluice, culvert, canal, ditch, drainﬂ. \n1.15 Sea Dike Crest Elevation \nSea Dike Crest Elevation has es\nsentially the same meaning as ﬁ\ndike crest height\nﬂ in the \nexisting document ﬁ\nDike Design and Construction Guide 2003\nﬂ. However, the existing \ndefinition of dike height suggest\ns that consideration of wave run-up and set-up is optional. \nThe term Sea Dike Crest Elevation is defined to specifically cover scenarios where wave run-\nup, overtopping and wind and wave setup must be in\ncluded in defining the height of the dike. \n1.16 Sea Dike System \nA system of: dikes, dunes, berms or natural sh\norelines that provide a similar function; and \nassociated engineering works (e.g., tidal gates, outfalls, outlet structures, seawalls, quay \nwalls, ramps, adjacent building \nfeatures, etc.) used to protect \nland from flooding or inundation. \nIn the Netherlands where dike \nsystems are highly evolved, a dike system is termed a ﬁdike \nringﬂ that forms the flooding defence for a region.\n  There are approximately 95 such rings in \n', ' Appendix A \n5 the Netherlands and each ring is the responsib\nility of a separate organizational entity, subject \nto national overview. \nIn BC, multiple Diking Authorities may share \nresponsibility for the sa\nme sea dike system. \n1.17 Sea Level Rise (SLR) \nAn allowance for increases in the mean elevati\non of the ocean associated with future climate \nchange, including any regional effects su\nch as crustal subsidence or uplift.  1.18 Sea Level Rise Planning Area (SLR Planning Area) \nAn area of land that may be subject to future flooding due to Sea Level Rise. This area \ndefines a future coastal flood plain.  The SLR Planning Area extends from the existing Natural \n\nBoundary landward to the highest predicted point\n of potential flooding related to SLR plus \nflooding expected from the combination of high tide, total storm surge and expected wave \nrunup during the Designated Storm. \nPredictions of SLR for the SLR Planning Area definition shall use best predictions for \nminimum periods of 90-100 years and 200 years forward. From time to time, both the Natural \nBoundary and the predictions for SLR are subjec\nt to change, and theref\nore the extent of a \nSLR Planning Area may be revised at regular intervals in the future. \n1.19 Seastate \nThe term ﬁseastateﬂ is used to encapsulate, \nin a general way, all of the parameters and \ncharacteristics that may be needed during design\n to define the waves at a given instant in \ntime.  The sea state is the general condition of\n the free surface of a body of waterŠwith \nrespect to wind waves and swellŠat a certain location and moment. The sea state is \ncharacterized by statistics, including wave height(s), period(s), distribution and power \nspectrum. The sea state varies with time, as\n the weather or oceanogr\naphic factors change.  \nFor engineering purposes the seastate is often \ncharacterized by the significant wave height, \nHs. 1.20 Setback  \nMeans withdrawal or siting of a building or \nlandfill away from the natural boundary or other \nreference line to maintain a floodway and to allow for potential land erosion.   \n1.21 Standard Dikes \nDikes built to a minimum crest elevation equal to the Flood Construction Level and meeting \nstandards of design and construction approved by the Ministry of Environment and \nmaintained by an ongoing authority such as a local government body. \n1.22 Storm Surge  \nA change in water level caused by the action of\n wind and atmospheric pressure variation on \nthe sea surface. The typical effect is to \nraise the level of the sea above the predicted \nastronomical tide level, although in some situations, such as when winds blow offshore, the \nactual water level may be lower than that predicted. The magnitude of a storm surge on the \nBC coast will be dependent on the severity \nand duration of the stor\nm event in the North \nPacific, its track relative to the BC \ncoast and the seabed bathymetry at the site. \n1.23 Total Storm Surge \nThe combination of the storm surge generated in\n deep water plus the additional local surge or \nwind setup generated by the effe\nct of the winds during the De\nsignated Storm over shallow \n', ' Appendix A \n6 water at a particular site.  In general the deep water storm surge is nearly the same as that \nrecorded at a tidal gauging station.  Additional \nsurge may occur at other sites.  For planning \npurpose, winds during a Designated Storm will st\nart to generate local surge in water depths \nless than 30 m. \n1.24 Wave Run-up \nThe vertical distance that waves run-up the seaw\nard slope of a structure \nor a shoreline.  The \nvertical distance is measured from the mean water level, which is the same as the \nDesignated Flood Level. \nFor coastal flooding hazard management the Wave Run-up is taken as 50 per cent of the \ncalculated run-up elevation on the natural shoreline.  This ratio is based on analysis \ncompleted for this assignment (2010) and may be revised as more information becomes \navailable. \nFor defining a Sea Dike Crest Elevation the Wave \nRun-up is taken to be the vertical distance \nexceeded by no more than 2% of the waves du\nring the Designated Storm at the toe of the \nsea dike \n1.25 Wave Set-up  \nAn increase in mean water surface close to t\nhe shoreline caused by wave action; important \nduring storm events as it results in a further increase in water level above the tide and surge \n\nlevels, landward of the location where waves star\nt to break. Wave set-up will lead to larger \nwaves existing at the seaward toe of a \nsea dike than might otherwise be expected. \n1.26 Wave Overtopping \nThe passage of water over the top of a sea dike as a result of wave runup or related surge \nand setup.  Water overtopping a sea dike may pass over the dike as a flow of water or as \n\nspray and the specific characteristic\ns are site and structure specific. \n1.27 Wind Set-up \nA rise of the water surface above the water le\nvel on the open coast due to the local action of \nwind stress on the water surface. \n2 Acronyms and Symbols \n2.1 CD Tide and chart datum Œ in Canadian waters the \nplane below which the tide will seldom fall.  \nTide datum and chart datum is usually the same provided the chart is the largest scale \n\navailable chart for area.  For a site specific survey tide and chart (sounding) datum may be \ndifferent and the specifics s\nhould be stated explicitly. \n2.2 CGD \nCanadian Geodetic Datum.  In 2010 the vertical reference plane in Canada is in the process \nof being changed from a MSL related datum plane Œ technically known as CGVD28 Œ to a \ngeoid based datum plan.  The update program is described at \n\nhttp://www.geod.nrcan.gc.ca/hm/index_e.php\n.  The term CGD is taken to mean the datum as \ndefined in 2010 and approximately equal to MSL. \n', ' Appendix A \n7 2.3 CHS \nCanadian Hydrographic Service \n2.4 CIRIA; CUR; CETMEF \nEuropean agencies sponsoring the ﬁRock Manualﬂ \n2.5 DPA Development Permit Area \n2.6 EA, ENW, KFKI \nEuropean agencies sponsoring the ﬁEurOtopﬂ Manual \n2.7 GCM \nGlobal Climate Model \n2.8 GHG \nGreen house gases \n2.9 H1/10 Mean height of the highest 10 per cent of waves in a given seastate \n2.10 H\ns Significant wave height Œ the mean height of the highest 1/3 of waves in a given seastate Œ \napproximately equal to the wave height esti\nmated at sea by experienced observers. \n2.11 HHWLT \nHigher high water large tide \n2.12 HHWMT \nHigher high water mean tide \n2.13 IPCC \nInternational Panel on Climate Change \n2.14 LLWLT \nLower low water large tide \n2.15 LLWMT \nLower low water mean tide \n2.16 MWL \nMean water level  \n2.17 QRA \nQuantitative Risk Analysis \n', ' Appendix A \n8 2.18 R\n2% \nWave run-up height exceeded by 2% of waves in a given seastate \n', ' Rev: 0 \nDate: 27 January 2011 \n\nProject No:  143111:  BC Ministry of Environment/ Climate Change Adaption Guidelines for Sea Dikes and Coastal Flood Hazard Lan\nd Use Appendix B \nAppendix B Œ Fundamentals and Defini\ntions for BC Coastal Flood Hazard  ', ' Appendix B \n Contents 1Introduction 1\n2Fundamental Concepts in BC Coastal Flood Hazard 1\n ', ' Appendix B \n1 1 Introduction The incorporation of Sea Level Rise consider\nations into an update of the existing documents\n for the BC Ministry of Environment \nis structured into three documents: \nPolicy Discussion Paper 2010 \n\nSea Dike Guidelines 2010 \n\nGuidelines for Management of Coastal Flood Hazard Land Use 2010 \nTo aid the reader in understanding the updates to\n the existing documents there is a need to \nunderstand fundamental concepts and \ndefinitions relating to BC Coastal Flood Hazards. This \nAppendix provides a summary of the fundamental concepts and definitions. \n2 Fundamental Concepts in BC Coastal Flood Hazard \nThe existing document: \nFlood Hazard Area Land Use Guidelines 2004\n was focussed on \nriver flood risks. The section on flooding by the \nsea (Section 3.5) did not fully anticipate sea \nlevel rise and assumed a static sea level. \nSea Level Rise (SLR) is now understood to be a ce\nrtainty in the future and very likely to result \nin an increase of 1.0 m by 2100. However, \nthe rate and height of SLR has considerable \nuncertainty. The Policy Discussion Paper 2010\n summarizes the range of projections for \nSLR that apply to BC. \nFigure B1 illustrates the elements relating to\n the risks from the sea in the existing \nFlood \nHazard Area Land Use Guidelines 2004. \n Figure B1: Coastal Flood Hazard Œ Existing (2004) Definitions \n', ' Appendix B \n2   In Figure B1,\n Mean Sea Level is essentially the same as \nthe terrestrial vertical datum plane of \nCanadian Geodetic Datum = 0 m. The tides, which are nominally centred about mean sea \nlevel, are established by the definable gravitat\nional interactions between the earth, the sun \nand the moon and are reasonably predicable. Although the difference between mean tide and \n\nhigh tide varies from place to place and from \ntime to time, these levels are defined by the \nCanadian Hydrographic Service and available for many locations in coastal British Columbia. \nThe Natural Boundary shown on Figure B1 is an es\ntablished concept in BC law Œ and reflects \nthe change in vegetation and the soil based on effects of the sea. In the\n Flood Hazard Area \nLand Use Guidelines 2004,\n building setbacks were established from Natural Boundary, on \nthe assumption that the location of Natural Boundary\n was relatively static (other than erosions \nand accretions).  \nThe Natural boundary is, in practice, often difficult to determine in the field or from remote \nsurvey.  \nFlood Construction Level (FCL) is established in the 2004 Guidelines as a general minimum \nof 1.5m above the elevation of \nthe Natural Boundary at the Sea. There are several exceptions \nto these guidelines, including: \n Coastal Bluffs, where the toe is closer to \nthe Natural Boundary than 15m, or when the toe \nis subject to coastal erosion. \n Bedrock or designed shore protection might allow a reduced setback. \n Lands behind Standard Dikes have setbacks and \nminimum elevations established in the \nSea Dike Guidelines. \n Lands outside the Strait of Georgia are s\nubject to tsunami hazard, and that generally \nprevails over the sea flooding guideline; \n Lands exposed to other sources \nof flooding e.g. from river estuaries, may have flooding \nhazards that are higher than the requ\nirements for a hazard from the sea. \nFigure B2 provides a more detailed interpretati\non of the flooding concepts for the sea in the \nthe existing Flood Hazard Area Land Use Guidelines 2004.  \nIn particular: \n The location of the Natural Boundary is \ngenerally higher and further inland than the \nlocation of the line marking predicable High \nTide. Two natural processes essentially then \ndefine the location of Natural Boundary: \no The water level during an ﬁordinary yearﬂ, which results in water and wave actions \nstrong enough to mark the shoreline sedim\nents in a distinct manner.  Implicitly this \nsuggests that it is likely associated with a commonly occurring storm or ﬁOrdinary \nStormﬂ. \no Wave related actions during the ‚Ordinary Storm™. \n the 1.5m additional vertical requirement \nthat defines the Flood Construction Level \ntherefore needs to account for two additional considerations:  \no an additional allowance for storm surge and wave effects for conditions greater than \nthe ﬁOrdinary Stormﬂ. \no A Freeboard allowance. \nThese considerations are shown in Figure \nB2.  If a freeboard allowance of 0.6 m is \nconsidered, based on the freeboard allowance in the existing companion document \nDike \n', ' Appendix B \n3 Design and Construction Guide 2003\n1, then an amount of 0.9 m remains to account for \nstorm surge and wave effects for conditions great\ner than the ﬁOrdinary Stormﬂ.  An allowance \nof 0.9 m is a reasonable allowance \nin many situations to allow for \na rise in the total water level \nduring a severe storm. \n  Figure B2: Coastal Flood Hazard - Interp\nretation of Existing 2004 Definitions \n Figure B3 extends this interpretation of the Existi\nng Definitions to include a specific allowance \nfor Sea Level Rise (SLR) and the expected effect\ns during a ‚Designated Storm™ Œ i.e.: a storm \nthat meets a stated risk criteria.  These combined influences define the total water level \n\nexpected at any time in the \nfuture for any desi\ngnated annual excee\ndence probability (AEP). \n(See Definitions in Appendix A). \n                                                     \n 1 ﬁDike Design and Construction Guide Œ Best Management Pr\nactices for British Columbiaﬂ, July 2003, published \nby the Province of British Columbia, Ministry of Wate\nr, Land and Air Protection (now the Ministry of Environment)\n ', ' Appendix B \n4 Figure B3: Coastal Flood Hazard Œ Adaptation for Climate Change \n Sea Level Rise will gradually raise both the m\nean sea level (MSL) and the tidal levels along \nthe BC Coast. Both MSL and tidal levels will rise in approximately equal amounts in response \nto SLR. For example, if the MSL rises 1.0m, all \ntide levels, including High Tide, also will rise \nby 1.0m.  Over time this will mean that MSL \nis no longer approximately the same as the \nterrestrial vertical datum plane (CGD), unless t\nhe terrestrial datum plane is adjusted at the \nsame rate. \nAs sea level rises, the storms \nthat occur will leave a mark on th\ne slowly changing shoreline.  \nIn particular the ‚Designated Storm™ will define; \nin conjunction with the local coastal exposure, \nthe nearshore bathymetry, shoreline orientati\non and topography, a Total Storm Surge and an \nadditional wave related runup (Wave Effects). T\nhe combination of antecedent storms and the \nDesignated Storm will move the existing Na\ntural Boundary landward to a new Natural \nBoundary location at the top of the wave affect\ned zone. At any given time in the future, the \nactual mark of this tide, stor\nm and wave action will reflect the \nlatest storm events, which may \nor may not be ﬁordinaryﬂ and the response\n of the particular stretch of shoreline. \nIt is recommended that a combination of the ‚Designated Flood Level™ and an estimate of the \nexpected shoreline response be used to establish the future Estimated Natural Boundary for \nplanning purposes, as this is a more predictable and practical tool than relying on future \nvegetation or soil response interpretations, in particular when SLR changes may be faster \n\nthan the new shoreline sediment \nor vegetation responds.  It is \nalso not clear that at any \nparticular time the mark on the shoreline will re\nflect an ﬁordinaryﬂ year. The elevation of this \nEstimated Natural Boundary location is defined as the Flood Construction Reference Plane \n\n(FCRP). \nTo calculate the FCL a Freeboard allowance is added above the Flood Construction \nReference Plane (FCRP) to allow for uncertainty. This Freeboard allowance may include \n', ' Appendix B \n5 uncertainties in the future changes to storm surge, wave run-up, and the effects of sea level \nrise on delta flooding and coastal sediment supply. \nThe Freeboard allowance should be the greater of: \n 0.6m, or; \n For flood proofing fill Œ crest elevation of equi\nvalent sea dike (see Sea Dike Guidelines \n2010) \n For exposed vertical building foundations Œ the wave-structure interaction; \n For tsunami areas Œ the runup elevati\non of the appropriate tsunami hazard. \nIn summary the general concept for calculating Future Flood Construction Level with SLR \nAllowance is: \n Future SLR Allowance + \n Maximum High Tide (HHWLT) + \n Storm Surge During Designated Storm + \n Wave Effects During Designated Storm + \n Freeboard Allowance \nThe FCL calculation will vary for a given target \nyear, and will vary for local areas in calculation \nof both High Tide as well as storm surge and wave effects. \n ', ' Rev: 0 \nDate: 27 January 2011 \n\nProject No:  143111:  BC Ministry of Environment/ Climate Change Adaption Guidelines for Sea Dikes and Coastal Flood Hazard Lan\nd Use Appendix C \nAppendix C Œ Sample Planning Wording  ', ' Appendix C \n Contents 1Sample Planning Wording 1\n ', ' Appendix C \n1  1 Sample Planning Wording \nThe Official Community Plan Policies Template (Form 1, Appendix B of the existing guideline \ndocument Land Use Guidelines 2004\n1) should have the following statement appended: \nﬁIn coastal and estuarine lowland areas of BC, Sea Level Rise may increase the risks of \nflooding to existing and proposed developments. \nThe OCP text and maps describe Sea Level \nRise Planning Areas and associated Flood Cons\ntruction Levels based on best current Sea \nLevel Rise projections.
