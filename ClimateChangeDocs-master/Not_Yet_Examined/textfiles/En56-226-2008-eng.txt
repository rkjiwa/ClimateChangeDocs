In the first few years, it was more predominantly within all economic sectors. Gradually\n\n‚sustainable development™ has evolved as a multidisciplinary topic where every discipline has a stake.\nClimate change has emerged as one of the most crucial environmental challenges of the 21st century.\nResearchers, policymakers and practitioners are concerned that climate change is a significant threat to\n\n‚sustainable development™. In the IPCC processes, it has received increasing importance and currently the\n\ndeep and multiple links between development and climate change are acknowledged, emphasizing the\n\nneed to move climate policy into the broader context of development, equity, poverty reduction and\n\nsustainability. However, this is a challenging task.\nThis Guidebook builds on the rich experiences of researchers within Environment Canada™s Adaptation\nand Impacts Research Division (AIRD) working with decision-makers on practical projects focused on\n\nclimate change and sustainable development. It provides a process closely tied to on-going planning cycles\n\nto help decision-makers incorporate climate change science, impacts,  adaptation and mitigation solutions\ninto their sustainable development initiatives. This Guidebook provides the needed assistance in help\n\nCanadians interpret the potential consequences of climate change impacts in the local context and how\n\nto develop adaptation actions and responses to address the anticipated consequences. Our intent was to\n\nproduce this Guidebook as a tool for planners, decision-makers, local practitioners and investors to help\n\nbuild  wealthier, healthier, safer and more resilient communities. \nAround the world local governments and communities are taking a leading role in adaptation and\nmitigation to climate change. I am hopeful that this Guidebook will strengthen our abilities to assess\n\nimpending impacts from a changing climate, develop adaptation strategies that are coupled with mitigation\n\nco-benefits and foster actions that will ensure a sustainable future. \nDon MacIver\nguidebook livia-rev-final:Layout 1  12/23/08  9:25 AM  Page 9', 'executive summary\nMany local governments have already begun working on decreasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.\nRecently, a growing number have begun examining ways to adapt to climate change Œ the act of\nreducing climate change impacts that are already underway. This Guidebook is intended to help those who\n\nare looking for ways to reduce the impacts of climate change (increasing heat waves, water shortages, intense\n\nstorms and sea-level rise) while decreasing GHG emissions and ensuring sustainable development for their\n\ncommunities.  Several different methods can be used to adapt to climate change.   Some of these methods\n\ncontribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions while increasing long-term sustainability.  Expanding the\n\ntree canopy in urban centres, for example, helps to reduce the impact of an increasing number of hot days\n\nand heat waves.  It also reduces the need for air conditioning, and so reduces greenhouse gas emissions from\n\nfossil-fueled electricity generation. Healthy trees also decrease the impact of intense rainfall, stormwater\n\nrunoff and pollution Œincreasing sustainability for our communities.  \nClimate change impacts will affect societies in complex and broad-ranging ways as technological, economic,\nsocial and ecological changes take place across regions, groups and sectors. Ecological impacts have cascading\n\neffects on social and health outcomes. Infrastructure problems have profound economic effects, such as the\n\nestimated $10 billion US price tag resulting from North America™s 2003 power outage. Cities, regions and\n\ncountries are linked through the global political economic system so that impacts in one area of the world\n\nmay affect other areas through economic forces, such as prices for agricultural products, or pressures including\n\ninternational migration.In North America, vulnerability to climate change will depend on the effectiveness and timing of adaptation,\nas well as the distribution of coping capacity. While Canada has considerable adaptive capacity when\n\ncompared to many less developed nations, vulnerability and adaptive capacity are not uniform across our\n\nsociety.  Socially and economically disadvantaged populations are likely to have less adaptive capacity than\n\nthe population as a whole,and climate ﬁsurprisesﬂ may bring weaknesses in adaptive capacity to light that\n\nwere not previously recognized (e.g., the 1988 Ice Storm, Hurricane Katrina or the 1995 Chicago heat wave).\n\nCommunity attributes, including social networks, social cohesion, volunteerism, economic and income\n\ndiversification, contribute to adaptive capacity and resilience. Societal impacts will therefore depend on\n\nfactors such as wealth, infrastructure quality, emergency preparedness, healthcare, community vitality,\n\neconomic and governance system structure, and population growth.\nAdaptation, Mitigation and Sustainable development (SAM) are often developed separately at the local\ngovernment and community level. Recognition of the need to integrate climate risks into development\n\npriorities and decision making is the principal driving force behind the development of the SAM project. A\n\nnumber of methods are possible for the integration of adaptation and mitigation in the context of sustainable\n\ndevelopment.  This Guidebook provides one such method.  \n10CANADIAN COMMUNITIES’ GUIDEBOOK FOR ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE\nguidebook livia-rev-final:Layout 1  12/23/08  9:25 AM  Page 10', 'GUIDELINES FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS \nThe following guidelines promote the development of adaptation responses with mitigation co-benefits\nand are tailored to local long-term priorities aiming tohelp build resiliency within communities.

Ces derniers temps, de plus en plus de gouvernements locaux ont commencé à chercher des\nmoyens de s™adapter aux changements climatiques, en réduisant notamment l™impact des changements\n\nclimatiques qui sont déjà en cours. Ce manuel est destiné à ceux qui cherchent des façons de réduire les\n\neffets des changements climatiques (tels que les vagues de chaleur de plus en plus fréquentes, les pénuries\n\nd™eau, les tempêtes intenses et l™augmentation du niveau de la mer) en diminuant leurs émissions de gaz à\n\neffet de serre et en assurant un développement durable pour leur collectivité. Différentes méthodes peuvent\n\nêtre utilisées pour s™adapter aux changements climatiques. Certaines de ces méthodes contribuent à la\n\nréduction des émissions de gaz à effet de serre tout en augmentant la durabilité à long terme. Augmenter les\n\ncouverts arborés dans les centres urbains, par exemple, aide à réduire l™impact des jours et des vagues de\n\nchaleur plus fréquents. De telles initiatives réduisent également les besoins de climatisation et, de ce fait,\n\ndiminuent les émissions de gaz à effet de serre engendrées par la production d™électricité au moyen de\n\ncombustibles fossiles. En outre, des arbres sains permettent d™atténuer les répercutions des pluies abondantes,\n\nde l™écoulement des eaux pluviales et de la pollution, tout en augmentant la durabilité de nos collectivités. \nLes manières, complexes et variées, dont les changements climatiques touchent les sociétés, diffèrent en\nfonction des changements technologiques, économiques, sociaux et écologiques que rencontrent les divers\n\ngroupes, régions et secteurs. Et les conséquences écologiques ont à leur tour des répercutions sur la société\n\net la santé. Les problèmes d™infrastructure affectent\n profondément l™économie comme le prouve la facture\nestimée à 10 millions de dollars à la suite de la panne de courant de 2003 survenue en Amérique du Nord.\n\nLes villes, les régions et les pays sont tous liés entre eux par le système politico-économique mondial. Cela\n\nimplique donc que les problèmes d™une région du monde peuvent avoir des incidences sur d™autres régions,\n\nnotamment par les forces économiques telles que le prix des produits issus de l™agriculture et les pressions\n\ncomme la migration internationale.Le degré de vulnérabilité de l™Amérique du Nord face aux changements climatiques dépendra de sa capacité\nà s™adapter de manière rapide et efficace, mais aussi de la répartition à différents niveaux de la capacité\n\nd™adaptation. Bien que le Canada ait une capacité d™adaptation considérable, comparativement à bon nombre\n\nde pays moins développés, on constate néanmoins que la vulnérabilité et la capacité d™adaptation ne sont pas\n\nles mêmes dans toute notre société. Les populations désavantagées sur le plan économique et social ont\n\npotentiellement moins de capacité d™adaptation que le reste de la population, et les imprévus climatiques\n\npeuvent mettre en évidence des difficultés d™adaptation qui autrement resteraient inconnues (p. ex. la tempête\n\nde verglas de 1998, l™ouragan Katrina ou la vague de chaleur de Chicago de 1995). Les attributs de la société,\n\ntels que les réseaux sociaux, la cohésion sociale, le bénévolat et la diversification économique et des revenus,\n\ncontribuent à la capacité d™adaptation et à la résilience. Par conséquent, les répercussions sociétales dépendront\n\nde facteurs tels que la richesse, la qualité des infrastructures, la préparation aux situations d™urgence, les soins\n\nde santé, la vitalité des communautés, la structure du système de gouvernance et économique, et la croissance\n\ndémographique.Souvent, l™adaptation, l™atténuation et le développement durable sont élaborés séparément au niveau du\ngouvernement local et de la collectivité. Le fait de reconnaître qu™il faille mettre les risques climatiques dans\n\nles priorités de développement et les prises de décisions est ce qui motive l™élaboration de ces trois aspects.\n\nBeaucoup de méthodes sont envisageables dans le cadre de l™insertion des concepts d™adaptation et\n\nd™atténuation dans le contexte du développement durable. Ce manuel offre l™une de ces méthodes.\n12CANADIAN COMMUNITIES’ GUIDEBOOK FOR ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE\nguidebook livia-rev-final:Layout 1  12/23/08  9:25 AM  Page 12', '13CANADIAN COMMUNITIES’ GUIDEBOOK FOR ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE\nLIGNES DIRECTRICES POUR LES GOUVERNEMENTS LOCAUX  \nLes lignes directrices suivantes favorisent l™élaboration de réponses concernant l™adaptation et recevant les\nbénéfices de l™atténuation, et elles sont adaptées aux priorités locales à long terme visant à renforcer les\n\ncollectivités.

Unfortunately, these efforts have\n\nprogressed slowly. One feature of these negotiations was the\n\nfragmentation of the climate change issue into sustainable\ndevelopment, adaptation and mitigation. Adaptation is\n\nurgently needed now in many places where the adverse\n\nimpacts of climate change are being felt. Mitigation is also\n\nurgent,but is viewed at a global level and a longer-term scale.\n\nBoth adaptation and mitigation are necessary to achieve\n\nsustainable development. It is widely understood that present\n\npatterns of development cannot be sustained, but it is much\n\nless clear what changes are most needed and how the\n\nproblems are to be resolved.\nThere is a temptation for those faced with the issues of\nclimate change at thelocal level to become frustrated, remain\n\nindifferent or focus their attention on more ﬁpressingﬂ\n\nproblems. However, it is at this local level where practical\n\nknowledge and experience can be drawn from, where\n\nintegration can begin. This does not mean that a solution is\n\neasy to achieve. Conflicts of interest are always present, but at\n\nthe local level they can be seen and assessed more readily; the\n\npossibility for agreement and action are much greater than at\n\nthe global level. It is this line of reasoning and the\n\nacknowledgement that adaptation, mitigation and sustainable\n\ndevelopment are often developed separately, and need to be\n\nconsidered together, that brought about the SAM initiative.\nSAM (Sustainable development, Adaptation and Mitigation)\nemerged from a number of seminars and discussions,\nincluding two workshops held in British Columbia in 2006\n\nand 2008 involving a group of academic researchers,\ngovernment scientists and local community representatives.\n\nThese concepts were revised and further developed for\n\npractical application in consultation with community and\nprovincial level stakeholders.  To date, SAM has been piloted\n\nin two case studies in British Columbia in the communities\n\nof Richmond and Quesnel. \nThis Guidebook promotes adaptation and mitigation in the\ncontext of sustainable development at the local level and\n\nprovides a set of consecutive steps and information that are:\n†  Proactive: \nSAM approaches areproactive in that they help\nlocal governments create responses that prepare\n\ncommunities for future climatic, policy and development\n\nchallenges. †  Collaborative: \nSAMapproaches are collaborative; they\nbring together stakeholders from different departments of\n\nthe local government, researchers from various expertises,\n\nthe private sector and many others.  \n†  Integrative:\nSAM approaches integratelong-term local\ndevelopment plans with present priorities, while exploring\n\nsynergies between decisions and responses to climate\n\nchange.  †  Flexible: SAM approaches provide flexibility and can be\ninitiated at several stages of a project. \n†  Practical\n: The SAM Guidebook provides additional\n\nreference materials, including: information on how to\n\ninterpret the consequences of climate change; potential\n\nadaptation options available;an extensive list of published\n\nguidebooks;and several other resources available for\n\nconsultation. introduction\nClimate change is a global problem, affecting us all.

This concept incorporates the\n\nnotion that for continued human progress, development\n\nmust find pathways that achieve economic goals, find a\n\nbalance with the physical environment and promote social\n\nwell-being, while using political strategies to reach these\n\npriorities. Linking the concept of sustainable development to\n\nclimate change provides an opportunity to explore long-term\n\nsocietal responses to global environmental change. \nSince industrialization, we have been significantly increasing\nthe concentration of GHGs in the atmosphere. Despite\ntechnological progress and available clean technologies, wehave\n\nfailed to reduce our environmental impact or drastically reduce\n\nemissions. In many instances, development has placed more of\n\nan emphasis on present and short-term well-being at the\n\nexpense of future generations.The significance of sustainable\n\ndevelopment options in increasing capacities to adapt and\n\nreducing GHG emissions leads to an important message that\n\ncould help guide responses to climate change at the level of\n\nlocal governments:there is a strong link between climate\n\nchange, increasing GHGs and our development decisions.\nFurthermore, only those responses to climate change that\nmeet the criteria of sustainable development and help build\n\nresilient communities will be effective in the long-run. Our\n\ncurrent choices are not sustainable. Building more green roofs,\n\nusing hybrid cars and increasing habitable space to protect\n\ncommunities from flooding are desirable changes,however,\n\nthey will have little impact if we continue to drive more,\nguidebook livia-rev-final:Layout 1  12/23/08  9:25 AM  Page 18', 'consume more and extensively develop on floodplains and\nvulnerable coasts. Sustainable, low-emission development\n\nactions occur at two different levels: first, large collective\n\ndecisions that will determine the framework within which we\n\nadapt and mitigate, including urban form, land use,\ntransportation infrastructure, energy and water systems; and\n\nsecond, cultural, social and psychological dimensions of values,\n\nlifestyle and consumption behaviour(Robinson, 2008).\nWorking toward resilient and sustainable communities \nwill require promoting climate change responses within\n\nsustainable development strategies and actions. However,\n\neven if we achieve low GHG emissions globally, we will still\n\nexperience changes in climate due to the presence of historical\n\nemissions, therefore, actions that help us adapt to climate\n\nchangeare necessary. \nResponses to climate change: adaptation\nand mitigation There have been two main responses to climate change:\nmitigation and adaptation. In the context of climate change,\n\nmitigation is defined as ﬁimplementing policies to reduce\n\ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and enhance sinksﬂ, while\n\nadaptation to climate change is defined as, ﬁ[an] adjustment in\nnatural or human systems in response to actual or expected\n\nclimatic stimuli or their effects, which moderates harm or exploits\nbeneficial opportunitiesﬂ (IPCC 2007). There is increasing\n\nrecognition that the world™s current progress on reducing\n\ngreenhouse gas emissions is not occurring rapidly enough to avoid\n\nimpacts from climate change in the coming century. Because of\n\nthis, the world is ﬁcommittedﬂ to a certain level of global warming\n\nand therefore, subject to a degree of impacts that will require\n\nadaptive responses by nations and communities.  Examples of\n\ntypes of adaptation are listed in Table 2.\nCANADIAN COMMUNITIES’ GUIDEBOOK FOR ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE\n19INTRODUCTION \nANTICIPATORY\nREACTIVE\nSUPPLY-SIDE\n\nDEMAND-SIDETOP-DOWN\nBOTTOM-UP\nAUTONOMOUS\nNON-AUTONOMOUS\n(PLANNED)\nTABLE 2.   \nTYPES OF ADAPTATION \nType of AdaptationExample\nLevel of Involvement\nCommunity and personalCommunity\nCommunity and production\nsystemsCommunity and personalNational\nCommunity andproductions systemsIndividual and community\nCommunity, production\nsystems and individualDiversifying rainfall removal by promoting rainwater\n\nstorage, permeable surfaces and drainage pipelines\nExpanding drainage infrastructure as a major way to\naccommodate heavy precipitation events\nBuilding water reservoirs to collect rainwater\nWater-metering to support water conservation\nChanging national standards, such as building codes, to\naddress changes in climate\nDeveloping community by-laws to regulate building\nconstruction, such as increasing habitable space, and\n\nincreasing areas of permeable surfaces to minimize\n\npressure on sewage system and flooding\nFarmer™s decision to change timing and species planted\nbased on observed weather changes\nChanges in water resource allocation to ensure\nbiodiversity protection, agriculture and drinking water\n\nsuppliesguidebook livia-rev-final:Layout 1  12/23/08  9:25 AM  Page 19', 'Climate change mitigation and adaptation have been\nconsidered separately in the global climate change discussion.\n\nHowever, there is increasing recognition that both mitigation\n\nand adaptation efforts are necessary in order to decrease\n\nclimate risks and capture co-benefits.At the level of actual\n\nactions, adaptation is needed now and can provide immediate\n\nand short term benefits. Mitigation is equally urgent in order\n\nto prevent future anthropogenic interference with the climate\n\nsystem, and will only begin to have an effect on global mean\nsurface temperature decades from now. The benefits of\n\nmitigation are not immediate. But, both adaptation and\n\nmitigation are essential: adaptation to reduce impacts in the\n\nnear term and mitigation to reduce long term impacts.

For example, efforts to reduce GHG\n\nemissions could include the concentration of housing\ndevelopment with renewable energy close to a town centre,\n\nwhile an adaptation strategy could dictate that if the town\n\ncentre is located close to a river prone to flooding it would be\n\ndesirable to locate new housing sufficiently far away from the\n\ncentre.\n20CANADIAN COMMUNITIES’ GUIDEBOOK FOR ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE\nINTRODUCTION \nFrom a practical point of view, designing local responses that simultaneously address the\nissues of climate change and sustainability is a challenging task. To help identify possible\n\nsynergies and trade-offs between mitigation and adaptation activities, it may be useful to\n\nconsider the four categories of interactions presented in Figure 1. Activities that fall into the\n\nlower left quadrant are unsustainable, resulting in both increased GHG emissions and\n\nvulnerability to climate impacts. Activities that fall into the upper right quadrant represent\n\nthe opposite condition: activities that build on the synergies between adaptation and\n\nmitigation and reduce both climate vulnerability and GHG emissions. Water conservation is\n\nan example of this type of activity and it is also an example of a sustainable development\n\nmeasure. The other two quadrants represent trade-offs created by focusing solely on\n\nmitigation or adaptation and, consequently, further increasing vulnerability or levels of GHG\n\nemissions (Cohen and Waddell, 2009). \nguidebook livia-rev-final:Layout 1  12/23/08  9:25 AM  Page 20', 'Figure 1does not capture the factors that will likely challenge\nthe progress toward a sustainable development pathway.\n\nThese include competing priorities, limited resources and\n\ndifferent understandings of sustainability.

To get there,\none flies from Winnipeg in a Dash-8 due north for about an hour to St. Teresa Point. From there\ntransport is a small boat with an outboard motor for 30 minutes to Wasagamack Œ a community to which\n\nalmost everything must travel by plane and then boat.\nOne morning I was having breakfast with some of the organizers of the work. I picked up a jar of jam that\nwas on the table. French Jam. French mango and pineapple jam. Wait a minute, I thought to myself, mangoes\n\nand pineapples don™t grow in France. How many times has whatever fruit there is in this jar been around the\n\nplanet to make it into my hands in Wasagamack? And worse than that Œ if I wasn™t preparing for a project on\n\nglobal warming, this thought would likely never have entered my mind. Why? Because for some reason, I am\n\nentitled to eat mango and pineapple jam from France.\nSo, there I was spiraling into a vortex of guilt and despair and, not wanting to endure that alone, decided to\nshare the thought with my colleagues at the table; social justice activists each and every one of us.\nUpon doing so, one of them, in a very weary voice said, ﬁCan™t we just have breakfast?ﬂ Understanding and\nsympathizing with the fatigue–.I shut my mouth. The voices in my head that don™t want to be seen to always\n\nbe a bother, that want to be liked, that are also tired and panicked at the enormity of the global warming issue,\n\nconvinced me, against my true better judgment, to be silent.\nOf course governments need to develop clear and well thought out policies to deal with this most important\nissue. Likewise, corporations must change their destructive behaviour on the planet. I have questions, though,\n\nif either of these necessities will have much meaning if each and every one of us humans don™t confront our\n\nown expectations, entitlements and patterns of behaviour that create the intricate web that both supports, and\n\nis, the unsustainable culture in which we live.\nDavid Diamond is a co-founder and the Artistic\nand Managing Director of Headlines Theatre.

Strategies have already been developed in cities\nsuch as Vancouver, Halifax, Boston, Seattle and New York (Penney and Wieditz, 2007). These initiatives involved a\n\nnumber of sectors, including collaboration between local government practitioners - focusing on identifying local\n\nvulnerabilities, adaptation and mitigation options (Case study 1 – King County, Washington’s adaptation plan). \n2.A SAM project-base approach: \nan initiative identifying specific vulnerabilities, capacities and responses in the context\nof particular local development projects. This approach explores ‘windows of opportunities’ as they occur in the\n\ncommunity. For example, when drainage, sewage, drinking water infrastructure are being renewed, transportation\n\nnetworks are being (re-)developed, residential areas or coastal zones are being developed, and when investments for\n\neconomic diversification are being allocated. When addressing potential infrastructure capacity issues associated with\n\nclimate change, the potential costs of adapting to climate change can also be reduced by building resilience into major\n\ninfrastructures, for instance during the construction of new buildings or roads. Carefully designed infrastructure could\n\nalso help in climate change mitigation efforts. However, this is likely to be a staged process, taking use of the following\n\nopportunities (TPCA, 2007 and LGA, 2006):\na.When infrastructure is upgraded;\n\nb.When development plans or other plans come up for regular review;\n\nc.When assessments are undertaken as part of a wider sustainability review; and\n\nd.Before service providers are forced to act by a sudden event or mounting maintenance costs.\nguidebook livia-rev-final:Layout 1  12/23/08  9:25 AM  Page 27', 'STEP 1Identify the focus and objectives of a\nSAM initiative\nThis first step is targeted on selecting the focus, key objectivesand stakeholders of a SAM project within the local\n\ngovernment.

To help identify the focus\nof the SAM project we suggest the following actions:\n1.Identify the risks that the community is facing or has experienced recently\n\n2.Identify relevant projects and initiatives that have been or could be vulnerable to weather-related events and/or non-\nclimatic hazards \n3.Based on your knowledge of the local system, identify the areas where capacity is lacking to address stresses that are\ncurrently posed by changes including by weather-related events\n4.Identify the important stakeholders within the local government and research communities that need to be involved\nin order to carry out the initiative\n5.Assess if there is funding available for your project. Is the funding agency supportive and will it allows for any additional\ncosts resulting from integration of adaptation and mitigation in the project?\n6.Identify responsible department, staff, approvals that may be needed for implementation within the local government\n(department, level, etc.).

Based on the focus of the SAM\n\nproject, the team could include members of the local\ngovernment, project developers and NGOs. The team may\nneed to collaborate with scientists and consultants. Also,\nexperiences from local government initiatives on adaptation to\n\nclimate change show that having a champion within the local\n\ngovernment helps to ensure that the project receives sufficient\n\nattention and support within the local government. While\n\ncapacity to address climate change issues may exist in isolated\n\npieces in departments of the local government, the nature of\n\nthis challenge requires coordination across departments. \nLocal governments, including Kativik Regional Government,\nThe Resort Municipality of Whistler and Toronto Public\n\nHealth, initiated the examples listed in this Guidebook.

The Team\n\nreports to the King County Executive.\nSource: Penney and Wieditz (2007)\nCASE STUDY 2\nForest renewal strategies in Quesnel (BC)\nFocus and objectives of the SAM project: \nTo develop a renewal strategy for the mountain pine beetle (MPB) infestation\nthat integrates local priorities for sustainability with economic diversification. The focus also addresses adaptation needs,\nbecause of linkages between the MPB and climate change and exploring opportunities for renewable energy production from\n\nbiomass (mitigation). To address these issues the process was initiated with local government in collaboration with forestry\n\ncompanies and small business’ representatives in the area.\nCurrent vulnerabilities and capacities:\nIn the short term, the MPB epidemic is increasing economic activity for many\ncommunities since the lodgepole pine timber harvest levels are increasing due to the need to use the dead trees before they dec\nayand lose their commercial value. This short-term surplus of harvestable timber will be followed by a significant reduction in the cut\n\nas the epidemic runs its course and dead trees reach the end of their economic usefulness. The loss of future timber supply pre\nsentsa very significant challenge to the communities affected because of pine making up over 50 per cent of the harvestable timber f\nrom\nwhich 80 per cent could be killed by 2013, and well over half the pine trees could be dead by the summer of 2007. \nEstimated potential impacts of changing climate: \nForests of mature lodgepole pine are prime habitat for the MPB. The\nbeetle also thrives under warm weather conditions. The interior of British Columbia has an abundance of mature lodgepole\n\npine. The area has experienced several consecutive mild winters and drought-like summers. Beetle populations in many parts\n\nof interior B.C. have increased to epidemic levels as a result.\nLong-term goals and principles:From the community perspective, the long-term focus is on promoting local social\nsustainability of renewal options by accounting for local needs, such as job and training requirements and effects on local\n\nindustries. The long-term goal is helping to create a sustainable community and healthy forest. \nResponses to climate change and their implementation: \nPotential responses include diversification of planted trees\nto increase adaptability to climate change, which includes a decrease of pine and an increase of hard wood. It will also includ\neusing wood waste material and small-scale wood planting for bioenergy production. The activities also suggest diversification\n\nof community businesses to rely less on forestry industry. This include activities such as expanding tourism, maintaining\n\nnaturally valuable areas, services for retirees and increasing a level of wood-processing within the community. \nSource: British Columbia™s Mountain Pine Beetle Action Plan 2006-2011 (2005)\nguidebook livia-rev-final:Layout 1  12/23/08  9:25 AM  Page 30', 'CANADIAN COMMUNITIES’ GUIDEBOOK FOR ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE\n31GUIDEBOOK FOR ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE STEP  1\nCASE STUDY 3\nIce Monitoring Program, Northern Quebec \nFocus, objectives and team in the SAM project: \nIn 2004, the Kativik Regional Government, in conjunction with the\nUniversity of Laval, the Ouranos Consortium and local researchers, launched an integrated community-based ice monitoring\nprogram to “contribute to local population’s abilities to cope with climatic change and maintain traditional harvesting activit\nies”in the region.  \nThe program combines Traditional Knowledge (TK), local observations, and scientific methods to develop a more accurate\nunderstanding of sea ice experiencing climate change.

By looking at currently applied principles\n\nand projections in local development (population growth\n\nscenarios, planned coastal and flood plain development,\n\nzoning, changes in the use of agricultural land, green spaces\n\nand parks) and assessing them for their potential to address\n\ncurrent and future challenges from climatic and non-climatic\n\nstresses, local vulnerabilities and adaptive capacities can be\n\nassessed. Attention needs to be given to evaluating the extent\n\nof collaboration between different departments, since\n\naddressing climate change and sustainability requires moving\n\naway from ‚silos™ and instead promoting collaboration\n\nbetween sectors. Investigating the linkages between current decisions in the\ncontext of development challenges and climate change are\n\nimportant, because:\n†  Inclusion of climate change impacts in the local\ndevelopment planning process has implications for much\nmore than climate or environmental policy. Local taxes,\n\ninfrastructure investments, land-use regulations and budget\n\nplanning processes all have major implications for local or\n\nregional development paths, and therefore for adaptation\n\nand mitigation options and impacts. †  The local context frames adaptation and migration\noptions. There are a number of ways to respond to climate\n\nchange impacts and reduce GHG emissions. For example,\n\nto respond to flooding we could think of flood attenuation\n\nand storage; upstream land management; permanent flood\n\ndefences including ring dikes around vulnerable areas;\n\ndiversion of flood flows; setting back river edge flood\n\ndefences to make space for water; changing the\nconfiguration of the coastline; green roofs; widening drains;\n\nmanaging flood pathways; raising floor levels; free-standing\n\nflood barriers; removable household products; and\nincreasing habitable space. However, the option selected\n\ndepends not only on the impact, but also on current and\n\nfuture local priorities. \n†  Responses to climate change very often require\nharmonization between decisions of different departments\n\nto avoid trade-offs and to benefit from synergies. Many\n\nlocal governments have already created working groups on\n\nsustainability in which they strive to avoid narrowly\n\nfocused policies that often neglect social or environmental\nbenefits. Similar approaches are needed to progress with\n\nthe responses to climate change. \n†  Finally, obtaining information about the community will\nhelp to establishwhich measures are feasible in the short\n\nand long-terms,with regard to current and future\n\ndevelopment plans and available capacities.\nThe completion of these actions will provide information\n\nabout the state of local development, capacities and local\n\nvulnerability. To address them, a number of methods can be\n\nutilized. We suggest conducting a series of interviews, but\n\nthese actions could also be discussed using focus groups\n(details about both methods are in Appendix1).To do this,\n\nthe project team could collaborate with researchers to help\n\nconduct the analyses and summarize the results. This exercise\n\nwill help to determine capacities and applied principles, and\nscenarios in local planning. One way to proceed further is to\n\ndiscuss the report in a meeting involving a project team and\n\nthe researchers working on the SAM project.

This\n\nstep provides information about whether current plans\n\nand priorities are effective to address current vulnerability\n\nand what are the available capacities to address these\n\nvulnerabilities.

Consider changes in level of GHGs as well. \n2.Identify socio-economic scenarios that are currently used in local planning processes.  What are the assumptions that\nform the basis of these scenarios? \n3.Assess to what extent current plans, policies and regulations account for the identified set of variables and their further\nchanges.  Are there measures that are presently enforced that are able to provide a buffer against expected future\nchanges, including climate changes? How flexible are they? How do they present challenges or barriers? \n4.Identify impacts of present day weather patterns (temperatures, precipitation, etc.) and severe weather events\n(windstorms, heat waves, cold snaps, rainstorms, thunderstorms, snowfalls etc.) on sector/infrastructure related to the\n\nfocus of your initiative  \n5.Discuss examples of responses to major weather events (flood, windstorm, thunderstorm, heat wave) that have occurred\nin the past. Were they effective? Why / why not? \n6.Identify information that you need gather in order to make effective decisions about adapting to climate change in\nissues related to the focus of your initiative (i.e., changes in design or operation of current systems to cope with changing\n\nweather patterns expected because of climate change). \nThis could include:•Local projections of climatic variables (precipitation, sea level rise, wind, flooding, snow melt);\n\n•Local consequences of the impacts (changes in local river hydrology, changes in ground water availability, impacts on\nslope stability, occurrence of pest and diseases etc.)\n•Best practices for adapting to climate change, that have been applied in similar conditions to your location\n\n•Information on low-carbon technological options that could address climate change impacts \n\n7.Identify departments that have the most flexibility or capacity to develop and implement new programs to cope with\nclimate change impactsguidebook livia-rev-final:Layout 1  12/23/08  9:25 AM  Page 33', 'GUIDEBOOK FOR ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE STEP  2\nCASE STUDY 4\nStorm surge mapping on Canada’s east coast\nFocus, objectives and team in the adaptation initiative: \nTo use storm surge mapping to predict the impact of the\ndesign storm at current and projected sea levels.  The project was initiated in 1998, by the Clean Annapolis River Project\n(CARP), a non-governmental organization in collaboration with the town of Annapolis Royal, focused on mapping storm\n\nsurge.  \nCurrent vulnerability and capacities: \nWith an average tidal range of 10 metres and an average frequency of two\nhurricane-type storms every three years, the Bay of Fundy and its surrounding coastal towns are susceptible to storm surges.\n\nMuch of the inhabited land bordering the Bay is at or below sea level, having been reclaimed by Acadian settlers in the 17th\n\ncentury with an elaborate system of dykes. The dykes, which now protect a large population and economically significant\n\nagricultural lands, have been maintained and upgraded based on a historical design from 1869. However, if projected impacts\n\nof climate change lead to unprecedented storm surges, they would surpass the dykes and overwhelm the coping capacity\n\nof the communities.  \nEstimated impacts of changing climate: \nCARP encountered many obstacles in their efforts because the data critical\nto the completion of the exercise, like elevation maps with reasonably small contour intervals, were either non-existent or\n\ndifficult to access. Nonetheless, they succeeded in generating maps, which indicated that much of the town would be\n\nflooded, and that critical infrastructure such as the fire department could be marooned from the rest of the community.  \nResponses to climate change and their implementation: \nResulting adaptations in the risk management strategy\nincluded the re-distribution of some emergency response equipment and the purchase of a boat by the fire department. The\n\nmaps also led to the organization of a mock disaster scenario to engage the public in disaster management planning. CARP\n\nhas since pursued some saltmarsh restoration in the Bay, a natural solution that can help reduce the impact of storm surges.\n\nThe maps indicated the need for changes in town planning and protection strategies. Presently, adaptation strategies include\n\nreviewing the emergency preparedness plans, improving the early warning system and collaboration with a number of\n\ndepartments and institutions to ensure the effectiveness of the early warning systems. \nSources: Belbin and Clyburn (1998); Danard, Munro and Murty (2003); McKenzie (2006)\n34CANADIAN COMMUNITIES’ GUIDEBOOK FOR ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE\nguidebook livia-rev-final:Layout 1  12/23/08  9:25 AM  Page 34', 'CANADIAN COMMUNITIES’ GUIDEBOOK FOR ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE\n35GUIDEBOOK FOR ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE STEP  2\nThe important part of a climate change impact assessment\nshould be not only obtaining information about changes in\nbasic climatic variables such as temperature and precipitation,\n\nbut also information on what these changes mean for the\nresources, infrastructure and vulnerability of areas relevant for\n\nthe local government. From the adaptation and vulnerability\n\nreduction point of view, these consequences arevery important\n\nfor the design of actual adaptation actions because they relate\n\nchanges in climate variables to socioeconomic and ecological\n\ndimensions of local development.After completing steps 2A and B, the major vulnerabilities to climate change should be identified. This could be done in\n\na meeting or workshop in which the climate impacts and\n\ntheir consequences are presented. Based on the current\n\nvulnerabilities and capacities, major future vulnerabilities can\n\nbe identified. To discuss the current and future vulnerabilities,\n\na method such as ‚what-if™ analyses could be used (see the\n\nAppendix 1 for more details).\nBy this stage of the SAM project, the study on major\nclimate change impacts relevant to your community has\n\nbeen completed and major future vulnerabilities have\n\nbeen identified.2B. Estimating impacts of  climate change \nThe purpose of this step is to estimate the impacts of climate\nchange in the context of the SAM project. The previous two\n\nsteps set the context for the climate change impacts. Except\n\nin areas of high vulnerability, climate change is usually not a\n\nmajor driver of changes in development policies and plans.\n\nEven so, it can act as a significant stressor that may influence\nthe direction of local development and vice versa. In\n\nparticular, climate change is most likely to have significant\n\nimplications for development by interacting with other\n\nstresses on sustainable development. For example, in areas\n\nwhere the aging infrastructure is under pressure because of\n\nthe growing population and limited resources for\n\nmaintenance, further stresses due to climate change could\n\nlead to severe consequences. \nSTEP 2B: METHODS AND ACTIONS\nWe suggest the following list of activities to estimate current and past experiences with weather-related events to help\nidentify future impacts of a changing climate:\n1.Identify the changes in climatic variables estimated by climate model simulations\n\n2.Estimate impacts of changing climatic variables on a resource-base that is relevant for the focus of the SAM project\n(hydrology, forestry, coastal land flooding due sea-level rise etc.)\n3.Assess the potential consequences of estimated impacts that could be relevant in designing future development\nactivities, adaptation and mitigation measures\n4.Identify areas of future vulnerability in the context of relevant plans, policies and regulations\nguidebook livia-rev-final:Layout 1  12/23/08  9:25 AM  Page 35', '36CANADIAN COMMUNITIES’ GUIDEBOOK FOR ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE\nGUIDEBOOK FOR ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE STEP  2\nCASE STUDY 5\nWater Management and Climate Change in the Okanagan Basin, British Columbia\nFocus and objectives of the adaptation initiative: \nThe goal of this initiative was to develop integrated climate change\nand water resource scenarios for the Okanagan Basin and engage stakeholders in dialogue on the implications of climate\nchange for water management in the region.\nCurrent vulnerabilities and capacities: \nThe Okanagan Basin is characterized by a semi-arid climate and rural agrarian\nlandscape and is a significant producer of tree fruits, wine grapes and other horticultural products. The region has also\n\nexperienced rapid population growth and urbanization in the past two decades, with populations increasing from 210,000\n\nin 1986 to 310,000 in 2001. Population growth is expected to continue, reaching 450,000 by 2031. Long-term climate\n\nrecords in the region indicated a significant warming trend, particularly in winter and spring, leading to earlier onset of spr\ningsnowmelt. Increased precipitation has also been observed in spring and summer, along with a reduction in the proportion\n\nof precipitation falling as snow at lower elevations. Low snow pack and hot dry summers led to drought conditions in 2002-\n\n2003, causing forest fires and impacts on water supplies in many parts of the basin affecting the ability to meet agricultural,\n\nresidential and ecological water demands. \nEstimated potential impacts of a changing climate: \nClimate and hydrological modeling indicates that the region can\nexpect earlier onset of spring snowmelt, a tendency toward a more rainfall driven hydrological regime, and reductions in\n\nannual and spring flow volumes in the 2050s and 2080s. Inflow to Okanagan Lake is estimated to decline to approximately\n\n69% of historical inflows by 2100. Agricultural water demand is expected to rise by 12-20% in the 2020s, 24-38% in the\n\n2050s, and 40-61% in the 2080s over the baseline modeled crop water demand of 200 million m\n3. Residential water demand\nis also expected to rise as a function of population growth, housing density and climate change.   \nLong-term goals and principles: Sustainable development is a major concern in the Okanagan Basin. In particular, there\nis a desire to maintain the rural agrarian landscape, while coping with increasing population growth and density. In this\n\ncontext, there is also a widely recognized need to address impacts of climate change on water supply and demand. Increasing\n\nwater use efficiency by all sectors, maintaining agriculture’s access to water and providing adequate water for fish habitat\n\nare all important priorities for water management.   \nResponses to climate change and their implementation: \nThe issue of climate change impacts on water supply and\ndemand has gained a profile in the region over the past several years. As a direct result of this research, climate change\n\nprojections were incorporated into a sub-regional water management plan and the topic has become has become a major\n\npart of sustainable development dialogue processes. A provincially-funded basin-wide water supply and demand study is\n\nunderway to more accurately characterize current and future water supply and demand and support planning and\n\nmanagement decisions. The Okanagan Basin Water Board has also been given greater powers to examine basin-wide water\n\nsupply and demand issues, explore water, energy and resource conservation issues to promote sustainability in the fast\n\ngrowing region.  \nSource: Cohen et al.

Where\ndo we want to be in the coming decades?3A:  Identifying goals and principles of local\nsustainability  This section is focused on examining future development\npriorities that are articulated in local planning documents\n\nsuch as Official Community Plans (in British Columbia) and\n\nsustainable development plans.Local plans developed under\n\nthe guidance of these documents provide an opportunity to\n\nreflect on local priorities in the context of current planning\n\ngoals, principles and the expected impacts of climate change. This step will provide an umbrella for identifying actions to\n\nrespond to climate change in the SAM project to meet overall\n\nlong-term priorities and help build a resilient community for\n\nthe future. The step requires creating a vision of the future.\n\nLocal planning documents very often provide key directions\n\nand trajectories for a desired local development path, but\n\noften remain very generic and leave space for diverse actions\n\nto be included to achieve the goals. In Case Study6, the\n\ndesired local development goals were diversifying the local\n\neconomy by extending tourist activities throughout the whole\n\nyear.\nWe suggest collecting the relevant planning documents and\n\nconvening a meeting or facilitated workshop to discuss the\n\nlong-term development priorities and what they mean for the\n\nfocus and the objectives of the SAM project. If such\n\ndocuments are not available, then the community could\n\nengage in creating a long-term local development scenario(s). \nAt this step, the future sustainable development priorities\nin the context of current trends and future climate\n\nimpacts for the SAM project should be selected. This will\n\nhelp to frame the selection of adaptation and mitigation\noptions discussed in the next step.STEP 3A: METHODS AND ACTIONS\nWe suggest the following list of questions to highlight long-term development priorities and visions at the local level in the\ncontext of the focus and objectives of an adaptation initiative: \n1.Based on community development priorities, identify the particular short and long-term priorities relevant for the focus\nof the SAM project\n2.Assess how these priorities help to build a resilient community\n\n3.Identify what planning and design challenges have been created as a result of these priorities\n\n4.Assess the challenges created by the future impacts of climate change on the attainment of these goals\nguidebook livia-rev-final:Layout 1  12/23/08  9:25 AM  Page 37', '38CANADIAN COMMUNITIES’ GUIDEBOOK FOR ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE\nGUIDEBOOK FOR ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE STEP  3\nSmart Growth and Climate Change in British Columbia\nLand use is the key factor affecting our quality of life. We can reduce transportation greenhouse gas emissions marginally\nthrough more efficient vehicles and cleaner fuels, but the only way to really address the issue is to reduce the total amounts\n\nwe drive. This can only be accomplished by more efficient land use and the development of compact, complete communities. \n‘Smart growth’ is a collection of land use and development principles that aim to enhance our quality of life, preserve the\nnatural environment, and save tax resources over time. The ten smart growth principles are:\n1.Mix land uses so that living, working, and shopping occur in close proximity. \n2.Build compact neighbourhoods and communities by identifying growth areas.\n\n3.Provide a variety of transportation choices as alternatives to driving.\n\n4.Create diverse affordable housing opportunities so that residents from all family types, life stages, and income levels\ncan live in the same neighbourhood.\n5.Encourage investments in infrastructure and servicing such that new developments do not take up new land.\n\n6.Preserve open spaces, wetlands, grasslands, and other environmentally sensitive areas. \n\n7.Protect and enhance agricultural lands. \n\n8.Utilize green infrastructure, alternative development standards, and green buildings.\n\n9.Foster a unique neighbourhood identity.\n\n10.Nurture engaged citizens.\nCreating smart growth communities means planning for the long term. Policy tools such as Official Community Plans (OCPs)\nand Regional Growth Strategies (RGS) create opportunities for communities across BC to incorporate smart growth principles\n\ninto guiding the future development of communities to be more resilient and adaptable to climate change. Currently, the\n\nplanning process in BC requires that landscape hazards be identified and the location of a community’s future development\n\nconsiders these hazards. Flooding, sea level rise, avalanche risk, and other climate change scenarios could (and should) be\n\nincorporated into this planning process to ensure that future development occurs in the safest places possible.\nRecently, the Government of British Columbia introduced new strategies and legislation that support the principles of smart\ngrowth and will encourage local and regional governments to grow smarter. These include the Brownfields Renewal Strategy,\n\nthe Carbon Tax, Bill 27, and a revised Building Code. Once Bill 27 comes into force, local governments will be required to\n\ninclude GHG emission targets, policies and actions in their Official Community Plans and Regional Growth Strategies and will\n\nbe able to use regulatory tools to promote energy and water conservation, and to waive or reduce charges for green\n\ndevelopment.\nThe research on urban form and climate change impacts and adaptation may be only beginning to emerge, but the links are\nalready clear. Smart growth communities are more walkable and better able to provide efficient transit, which is increasingly\n\nimportant as the cost of fuel rises. They are surrounded by productive and protected farmlands to provide residents with\n\nincreased food security. Carbon sinks such as forests, wetlands and other naturalized areas are conserved. They redirect\n\nand encourage a strong local economy by keeping small businesses in town centres alive and thriving. \nCleary, the ‘where’ and ‘how’ of climate-resilient communities tomorrow will be based on smarter growth today. \n(Contributed by Ione Smith)\nguidebook livia-rev-final:Layout 1  12/23/08  9:25 AM  Page 38', 'GUIDEBOOK FOR ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE STEP  3\nCASE STUDY 6\nEconomic Diversification and Sustainability Planning\nFocus, objectives and team in the adaptation initiative:\nThe Resort Municipality of Whistler (the municipal\nadministration) and Intrawest Corporation (the resort operators) have been actively developing their non-winter tourist\nopportunities, hence diversifying the local economy and making the community more resilient to climate change.  \nCurrent vulnerability and capacities:\nCurrent vulnerability and capacities: Investments have been made into several\n“off-season” activities, most notably to the thriving mountain biking industry. This activity ideally complements the ski\n\nseason: it operates when conditions do not support skiing (during the spring, summer, fall, and even warm winter spells),\n\nand much of the same infrastructure (such as ski lifts) can facilitate both sports. Other summer offerings include golf,\n\nhorseback riding, hiking, and white water rafting. Whistler’s investments have resulted in steadily increasing room revenue\n\nover the past several summers.  \nLong-term goals and principles: The municipality has also developed a comprehensive sustainability plan, entitled\nWhistler 2020. One of the goals of the plan is to ensure ongoing economic viability through a continued focus on\n\ndiversification and other activities. Indicators also monitor changes in GHGs, energy use and effectiveness of conservation\n\nand recycling efforts. Developers of the plan have identified several measurable indicators of economic viability, and monitor\n\nthese indicators regularly. Outputs from \nWhistler 2020monitoring allows residents and town planners to verify that\neconomic adaptations are actually improving the resilience of the municipality to climate change.   \nResponses to climate change and their implementation:\nHowever, \nWhistler 2020is a strategic adaptation that\ncomplements the economic adaptations previously pursued. The monitoring of economic indicators, as determined by the\n\nplan, could help ensure that present and future economic decisions shape a robust and sustainable economy as Whistler\n\nencounters climate change. Recent activities to reduce GHG emissions are being introduced including waste recycling,\n\nenergy efficiency, conservation, increased use of renewable energy and offsetting carbon emissions. It is important to note\n\nthat Whistler has a distinct advantage over other resort municipalities and tourism businesses because of its status as a\n\nwell-established, corporately-owned facility with a big budget and substantial political leverage. \nSource: RMOW (2006); RMOW (2007)\nCANADIAN COMMUNITIES’ GUIDEBOOK FOR ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE\n39guidebook livia-rev-final:Layout 1  12/23/08  9:25 AM  Page 39', '40CANADIAN COMMUNITIES’ GUIDEBOOK FOR ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE\nGUIDEBOOK FOR ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE STEP  3\n3B.   Assessing impacts of climate change and\npotential for adaptation and mitigation \nA number of options are available to adapt to expected\nclimate impacts and similarly, there are number of ways to\n\nreduce GHG emissions. In this step, we focus on identifying\n\na portfolio of responses to climate change that fits within the\n\nfocus of the SAM initiative. Building on the close linkages\n\nbetween climate change related measures, capacities and local\ndevelopment goals, the aim of the SAMproject becomes one\n\nof avoiding ﬁdangerousﬂ local situations by identifying\n\nadaptation options and assessing them in order to determine\n\nwhich are most viable. Mitigation measures can increase local\n\nvulnerability to climate change, and measures for adaptation\n\ncan increase local emissions of GHGs Œ unless they are\n\ndiscussed together. This could be achieved for example by\n\nconservation measures and producing renewable energy. \nWe suggest the following list of actions to develop a portfolio of adaptation and mitigation responses to climate change\nand identify synergies between them:\n1.Estimate impacts of climate change and vulnerabilities of the local system that require adaptation. What kind of\nexpected impacts do we need to adapt to?\n2.Identify measures that could provide adaptation to estimated impacts of climate change in the development context\nof your adaptation initiative (see also Section 6.6)\n3.Identify the current and expected emission reduction targets, involved sectors and considered mitigation measures\n\n4.Assess the opportunities for emission reduction that are feasible under expected impacts of climate change \n\n5.Assess how the measures identified can be adjusted or modified to maximize both mitigation and adaptation benefits\n\n6.Identify the social, environmental and economic benefits and costs for the community if the SAM project promoted\nmeasures linking both adaptation and mitigation\nSAM projectsfocused on issues with a long lifespan,\n(transportation, infrastructure, expansion, urban\n\ndevelopment, reforestation, responses addressing adaptation\n\nneeds,and mitigation potentials)could foster efficient use of\n\nresources sustained with even stricter emission reduction\n\npolicies and bigger impacts of climate change.For already implemented measures in Canada, an example\nlinking adaptation and mitigation could be the use ofphotovoltaics (Case Study7).   They provide a source of clean\n\nenergy (mitigation) and a source of energy during power\n\noutages (adaptation). Another example is the Toronto Heat\n\nAlert system (Case Study 8), which presents an adaptation\n\nresponse to heat waves in the city that relies mostly on public\n\ncooling centres; and in the long-run suggests the importance\n\nof sustainable responses such as expansion of green spaces and\n\ngreen roofs in the city.  \nguidebook livia-rev-final:Layout 1  12/23/08  9:25 AM  Page 40', 'GUIDEBOOK FOR ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE STEP  3\nAt this step of the SAM project, a list of adaptation options, with mitigation co-benefits that minimize trade-offs between\nadaptation and mitigation and are feasible at the local level, have been developed. \nSTEP 3B: METHODS AND ACTIONS\nThis step requires development of adaptation options that offer mitigation benefits that address current vulnerability and\nthe impacts of climate change, while helping to achieve the long-term priorities of the community. Methods are available—\n\nincluding expert judgments and portfolio analyses—to discuss potential adaptations (see the next section on adaptation\n\nexamples). We suggest that the project team organize a workshop within the local government while inviting departments\n\nrelated to the focus of the project. The project team could also consider inviting representatives from neighbouring\n\nmunicipalities or experts on the issue related to the focus of the initiatives (for example, dikes if you deal with flooding, f\norest\nsystem if you deal with reforestation etc). During the workshop, adaptation options with mitigation co-benefits will be\n\nidentified. To help, the next section lists adaptation options by sector. We suggest the following workshop agenda to develop\n\na portfolio of adaptation responses:\n1.Present a focus of the SAM project and relevant long-term development priorities \n\n2.Present the outcomes of the scoping study, including the consequences of the impacts and identified areas of major\nvulnerabilities 3.Use a list of suggested adaptation options and involve the workshop articipants in identifying a list of responses to\nclimate change (through group discussion) that fits within the focus of the SAM project\n4.Create a list of potential responses to climate change \n\n5.Finally, based on the identified list of responses to climate change, discuss further information that may need to be\ncollected about these options in order to be considered for implementation \nCANADIAN COMMUNITIES’ GUIDEBOOK FOR ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE\n41guidebook livia-rev-final:Layout 1  12/23/08  9:25 AM  Page 41', 'GUIDEBOOK FOR ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE STEP  3\nCASE STUDY 7\nDistributed generation using photovoltaics\nFocus, objectives and team in the adaptation initiative: \nEvaluating the feasibility of distributing the generation of\nenergy amongst many small-scale producers is one adaptive strategy that can build resilience against climate change\nimpacts. Current vulnerability and capacities: \nAutonomous (stand-alone) systems are not connected to the energy grid and\nthey can provide resilience for building owners. One off-grid homeowner noted that, after the ice storm, his family returned\n\nto regular functionality much faster than his neighbors. Grid-connected systems can act as an adaptation for the energy\n\nsector as a whole, reducing the disruptive potential of an extreme weather event – if smaller systems fail, fewer people are\n\naffected. Hybrid systems offer the best of both options, because they are connected to the utility, but have an emergency\n\nback-up battery in case of grid failure. The PV market in Canada is expanding steadily, with more than 50% growth between\n\n2002 and 2004. Estimated impacts of changing climate: \nClimate change will likely shift and in some cases increase the peak energy\ndemand in Canada from winter to summer, which requires adjustments in our infrastructure\nLong-term goals and priorities: PV systems generate the most electricity during the heat of the day, thus reducing the\nvulnerability of central generation plants. They were not designed as a response to climate change, nor are they often\n\nidentified as a potential adaptation. However, a well-designed DG network could be a powerful and far-reaching “no regrets”\n\nadaptation. Unfortunately, uptake of this technology is occurring slowly because grid-tied systems are economically\n\nuncompetitive, while stand-alone systems are only competitive in certain circumstances. Government support of this\n\nindustry could be invaluable.  Responses to climate change and their implementation: \nEnergy generation is one of several contentious issues\nthat polarizes the “mitigation” and “adaptation” agendas. Many adaptations to extreme weather involve the consumption\n\nof energy (like air conditioners, for example), while traditional production of energy adds to climate change. Distributed\n\ngeneration of renewable energy could bridge that divide by improving the resilience of the energy grid while concurrently\n\nmitigating GHG emissions.  \nSources: Dignard-Bailey (2002); Oke (2007)\n42CANADIAN COMMUNITIES’ GUIDEBOOK FOR ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE\nguidebook livia-rev-final:Layout 1  12/23/08  9:25 AM  Page 42', 'CANADIAN COMMUNITIES’ GUIDEBOOK FOR ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE\n43GUIDEBOOK FOR ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE STEP  4\nSTEP 4Setting trajectories to meet priorities.\nHow can we get there?\n4A:  Identifying actions to achieve the vision of \nthe future    \nExperiences in developing responses to climate change\nshowed that placing greater responsibility on planning\n\nbodies and collaboration among government officers and\n\nstakeholders to resolve planning issues promoted greater\n\nlocal ownership of policies and an increased commitment to\n\ntheir implementation (UKCIP,2001). To progress toward\npolicies and implementation, the options identified need to\nbe communicated in a language that speaks to the target\naudience. Action is best enabled when it fits into the current\n\nmandate and activities of decision-makers,or when it is\n\nlinked to the goals expressed in existing planning\n\ndocuments. In terms of implementation, adaptation options may be\nconsidered on different time scales. Short-term ﬁno regrets\n\nactionsﬂ are those actions where society would benefit from\n\ntheir implementation, even if anthropogenic climate change\n\ndid not take place. STEP 4A: METHODS AND ACTIONS\nTo move from the list of adaptation options in the previous step to implementation, we suggest using the following list of\nquestions:1.Identify the ‘preferred options’ that reach the overall development priorities for the future development pathway in\nthe context of the adaptation initiative\n2.Investigate if there are actions that provide win-win and/or no-regrets solutions both in the context of climate change\nand the adaptation initiative\n3.Identify short-term measures that are needed to implement the selected option\n4.Identify long-term measures that are needed to ensure the implementation\n\n5.Assess what capacities are needed to ensure that the planned actions could be implemented effectively. Who will be\nresponsible for implementation?\n6.Estimate how progress will be measured and evaluated. Are there existing systems in place to monitor the progress?\n\n7.Assess what procedures are needed to incorporate lessons learned into future planning and best practices\nguidebook livia-rev-final:Layout 1  12/23/08  9:25 AM  Page 43', '44CANADIAN COMMUNITIES’ GUIDEBOOK FOR ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE\nGUIDEBOOK FOR ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE STEP  4\nThe case studies listed in this Guidebook provide examples of\nimplemented actions that include diverse short-term and\n\nlong-term measures. These actions include building water\n\nstorage facilities (Case Study 9), building public cooling\n\nfacilities and distributing water (Case Study 8), and installing\n\ndevices to generate electricity (Case Study 7).  The identified\n\nadaptation often requires setting up long-term goals that will\n\nbe implemented continuously, such as funding programs for\n\nlocal communities (Case Study9), development guidelines\n\nfor economic diversification to minimize dependence on\n\nservices or forestry sensitive to weather and climate (Case\n\nStudy2) and ensuring long-term monitoring of sea ice\n\nchanges and distributing this information to communityusers (Case Study3).\nAt this step you need to evaluate our list of adaptation options\n(Table 4 and 5) to climate change, select the most feasible\n\noptions and transform them into actual actions. There are\n\nseveral methods (see Appendix 1) that can be used to select\n\nadaptation options, including:†  Trade-off analyses\n†  Multi-criteria analyses\n\n†  Experts™ judgments\n\n†  Cost assessments: including cost-benefit analyses,\nassessment of cost of adaptation, cost of inaction, andcost-effectiveness analysesTo conduct any of the suggested methods, criteria will be\n\nneeded that will provide information about the trade-offs\n\nbetween different responses, the urgency of needed responses\n\nand the availability of resources - both financial and\n\ninstitutional for implementation (table 3). A consultant may\nalso be required. \nBy this step of the SAM project, you will have created a\nlist of adaptation responses that are a priority for the\n\nshort, medium and long term.  \nguidebook livia-rev-final:Layout 1  12/23/08  9:25 AM  Page 44', 'CANADIAN COMMUNITIES’ GUIDEBOOK FOR ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE\n45GUIDEBOOK FOR ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE STEP  4\nSUSTAINABILITY:\nSOCIAL,\nECONOMIC,\n\nENVIRONMENTAL\nEFFECTIVENESSRISK ANDUNCERTAINTY\nOPPORTUNITY\nIMPLEMENTATION\nTABLE 3.   \nSUGGESTED CRITERIA FOR EVALUATING CLIMATE CHANGE RESPONSES \nCategoryCriteria1 (low)\n2 (medium)3 (high)\nMitigation \nco-benefitsEnvironmental\nimpactsEquity\n\nImplementation\nCostOperating and\n\nMaintenance Cost\nRobustness\nReliability\n\nUrgency\nDegree of risk\nor impactPrecautionary\nAncillary\nbenefitsNo-regret\noption \nPiggybacking\nWindow of\nOpportunity\nPublic\nacceptabilityFunding sources\nCapacity (info,technical, staff,\n\nresources)\nInstitutional\nResult in increased\n\ngreenhouse gas emissions\nResult in net environmental\ncostsBenefits to few people\n\nCost of implementation ishigh relative to cost of\n\ninactionCost of operation andmaintenance is highEffective for a narrow range\nof plausible future scenarios\nThis measure is untested\nRisks are likely to occur in\nthe longer-termFuture risks are minor and\nreversible\nThe risk is generallyunderstoodThis measure will contribute\nlittle or not at all to other\ngoals for the communityThis measure will have little\nor no benefit if climate\nchange impacts do not\noccurThere is no window of\nopportunity currently\nLikely to face publicoppositionExternal funding sources are\nrequired but have not been\n\nidentifiedCurrent capacity is insufficient\n\nand gaps cannot be easily\naddressed\nImplementation requires\n\ncoordination with, or action\n\nby, other jurisdictions\nWould not affect\n\ngreenhouse gas emissions\nResult in no-net loss of\nhabitat or ecosystem\nservices\nBenefits to many people\nCost of implementation ismoderate relative to cost\n\nof inactionCost of operation andmaintenance is moderateEffective across many\nplausible future scenarios\nExperimental but has\nexpert support\nImpacts are beginning to\n\noccur, or are likely to occur\n\nin the near- to mid-termFuture risks are moderate\n\nand reversible\nSome uncertainty exists\nThis measure will contribute\nsomewhat to other goals\nfor the communityThis measure will have\nsome benefits regardless of\n\nactual climate change\nimpactsA window of opportunity\ncould be created\nNot likely to receive much\npublic attentionExternal funding sources\nare required and likely to\n\nbe secured\nGaps exist in one or \nmore areas but can be\n\naddressed\nImplementation requires\nexternal approval\nWould reduce greenhouse\n\ngas emissionsResult in net environmental\nbenefitsSignificant benefits to many\npeopleCost of implementation islow relative to cost of\n\ninactionCost of operation andmaintenance is low\nEffective across a wide range\nof plausible future scenarios\nThe effectiveness of thismeasure is proven\nImpacts are already\noccurringFuture risks are potentially\ncatastrophic or irreversible\nThe risk is not wellunderstoodThis measure will contribute\nsignificantly to other goals\nfor the communityThis measure will result in\nsignificant benefits\nregardless of actual climate\n\nchange impactsA window of opportunity\nexists to implementLikely to receive public\nsupport\nFunding is available\nCurrent capacity is\nsufficientImplementation is within\nlocal controlguidebook livia-rev-final:Layout 1  12/23/08  9:25 AM  Page 45', '46CANADIAN COMMUNITIES’ GUIDEBOOK FOR ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE\nGUIDEBOOK FOR ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE STEP  4\n4B.  Developing capacities and institutional linkages\nto support implementation To achieve successful implementation of the adaptation\ninitiative, it is important to ensure that the various agencies\n\nthat may be involved in,or affected by,the activity are\n\nsupportive. Local governments in Canada are required to\n\ncomply with a host of regulations, guidelines and standards\n\nthat are developed by other levels of government or regulatory\n\nbodies that govern professional practice. Additionally, many\nissues, such as the management of drinking water supply and\ndemand, involve multiple agencies at municipal, regional,\n\nprovincial and federal government levels. Existing statutes,\n\nregulations, bylaws, building codes and professional best\n\npractices may not currently support or allow for\n\nunconventional or innovative development that may be\n\nrequired by the SAM project to meet adaptation, mitigation\n\nand sustainable development goals. It is therefore necessary to\n\nbuild collaborative relationships and teams so that the project\n\ncan be implemented and that the lessons learned can be\ntranslated into best practices at all levels. \nIt would be beneficial to consider some of these actions\n\nthroughout the SAM project™s process, as they may influence\n\nwho is engaged as part of the project team and  to help avoid\n\npitfalls during the implementation stage. Outcomes of the\n\nevaluation from the previous step will provide valuable\n\ninformation on what capacities are needed to implement the\n\nSAM project. In the listed cases focused on emergency\n\npreparedness (Case Studies 4 and 8) additional capacities\n\nwere needed in order to implement a plan. In Case Study9,\n\nadditional capacities were needed to maintain facilities and\n\nthe program.\nIt is also important to consider that with climate change\n\nprogressing, more adaptation and mitigation actions will be\n\nneeded. Therefore, developing a capacity to address future\n\nchallenges should be considered when the capacity needs are\n\ndefined. The questions in this step and the outputs from the\n\nprevious step could be addressed in discussions with the\n\nproject team.   \nAfter the completion of this step, the SAM project teamwill have a clear picture of what adaptation options with\n\nmitigation co-benefits will be implemented and what are\n\nthe capacities for successful implementation.STEP 4B: METHODS AND ACTIONS\n1.Identify how the implementation of measures will be funded. Does the budget for current and forthcoming years enable\nactions to be implemented?\n2.Identify staff that will be responsible for implementation within the local government (department level, etc.)\n3.Assess whether project implementation has support from all levels (council, senior management, operations, etc.) and\ndepartments (planning, engineering, bylaw enforcement, etc.) within the local government. If not, how can support be\nenhanced?4.Assess whether there are adequate human and material resources. If not, where can resources be obtained?\n5.Gather information about the public awareness and support of the project. Is an education and outreach program\nrequired? Is a communication strategy required?\n6.Estimate linkages to other agencies outside of the local government. What involvement or buy-in from other agencies\nis needed for successful implementation?\n7.Assess whether the project is entirely within the jurisdiction of the local government or do other levels of government\nneed to be engaged by the project team.\nguidebook livia-rev-final:Layout 1  12/23/08  9:25 AM  Page 46', 'GUIDEBOOK FOR ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE STEP  4\nCASE STUDY 8\nHeat Health Alert System\nFocus and objectives in the adaptation initiative: \nDevelop and implement an emergency preparedness plan to\nmitigate the effects of high summer temperatures often exaggerated by humidity and urban heat island effect.\nCurrent vulnerability and capacities: \nHigh summer temperatures, particularly when sustained over consecutive days\nor when coupled with other factors such as humidity, are correlated with many negative health implications. In an urban\nsetting, high temperatures are exacerbated by the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect, leading to even more health implications.  \nEstimated impacts of changing climate: \nClimate change predictions show increasing occurrence of heat waves with\npossible negative impacts on human health.\nLong-term goals and priorities:To increase the resilience of the city by preparing the population for impending heat\nthrough emergency preparedness and by minimizing the local sources of urban heat. \nResponses to climate change and their implementation: \nIn light of these projections, the Toronto Public Health\npartnered with the Toronto Atmospheric Fund to develop a Heat Health Alert System. When forecasts predict that the\n\nthreshold of certain pre-determined high-risk climate criteria will be breached, the alert system is triggered. Warnings are\n\nadvertised on the radio, television and internet, and a web of social service organizations are contacted in an attempt to\n\nconvey warnings and advice to vulnerable populations. Bottled water is distributed to the homeless; shelters allow people\n\nto stay inside during the day; and a service performing house calls to at-risk individuals is made available on request. 99\n\nlibraries and 81 community centres, all of which are air-conditioned, provide relief from the heat. During extreme heat\n\nalerts, four civic buildings are made available as designated cooling centres.\nThis program should ideally be complemented with some long-term adaptation actions to reduce urban heat, such as the\nexpansion of green spaces, the increase of porous city surfaces and the facilitation of green roofing.    \nSources: Penney and Wiedtz (2007)\nCANADIAN COMMUNITIES’ GUIDEBOOK FOR ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE\n47guidebook livia-rev-final:Layout 1  12/23/08  9:25 AM  Page 47', 'GUIDEBOOK FOR ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE STEP  4\nCASE STUDY 9\nTank loading facilities\nFocus, objectives and team in the adaptation initiative: \nThrough a cross-jurisdictional partnership between the\nNational Water Supply Expansion Program (NWSEP), provincial counterparts have worked with communities and individual\nfarmers across the country to support preparation for water shortages in agriculture and in the community. \nCurrent vulnerability and capacities:\nIn response to adverse weather in 2001 – 2002, farmers typically exercise a\nvariety of coping methods - from altering irrigation and watering techniques, to planting alternative crops, to changing the\n\nend product – with qualified success. \nEstimated impacts of changing climate:\nClimate model scenarios project changes in precipitation, increasing\noccurrence of drought and heavy rainfall over a short time.  \nLong-term goals and priorities: Providing security to local agriculturalists and communities in the event of increasingly\nfrequent periods of water stress. \nResponses to climate change and their implementation: \nA tank-loading facility is a non-potable community well\nbuilt in an area of stable groundwater supplies, as identified by hydrological investigations. At a cost of $1.00 for\n\napproximately 908 litres, farmers can use the facilities to fill portable water tanks, which can be hauled back to the farm for\n\na variety of agricultural purposes - from livestock watering to spray operations. As an added bonus to the community, the\n\nfacilities also provide extra water for emergency response when necessary, an important safeguard during drought when the\n\nrisk of fire increases. As of spring 2007, four facilities have been completed and twomore are under construction. These\n\nresponses should also be accompanied by measures promoting increased water efficiency and conservation in irrigation\n\nand other activities.\nSource: Belliveau et al.

Scientific knowledge\n\nin the climate change field is progressing rapidly and it is\n\nexpected that more detailed localized data will be available in\n\nthe coming years. In addition, human capacities and\n\ngovernance are also changing at all scales. This may create\n\nnew opportunities or lead to setbacks as political and social\n\npreferences change and new issues overshadow old ones.\n\nClose monitoring of the adaptation initiative after\n\nimplementation by both practitioners and policy-makers\n\ncreates opportunities to address challenges as they appear. \nIt is important to maintain contact with the project team and\n\nscientists so they can up-date you on the latest developments\n\nand provide data about impacts and responses to climate\n\nchange. Because climate change is a rapidly evolving issue in\n\nresearch and practice and because local, national and\n\ninternational policies are continually developing,\n\nopportunities may arise for follow-up activities on the\n\nadaptation initiative or new projects that demonstrate\n\npractical ‚on the ground™ solutions to climate change in the\ncontext of local development may be identified. \nMonitoring the performance of the implemented adaptation\nactions is one of the important priorities of this step. A\n\npotential list of indicators to monitor the performance of the\n\nimplemented adaptation options could include: †  Average carbon emissions for heating, cooling and\ntransport per unit of new buildings \n†  Amount of housing and commercial development\npermitted in flood risk or vulnerable coastal areas \n†  Average permeable and non-permeable surface area in\npermitted developments\n†  Total renewable energy and /or electricity supply (energy\nor electricity supplied)†  Average domestic/freight trip length/total distance per\nperson/vehicle per annum†  Average level of waste recycling per type of waste in the\ncommunity †  Average level of outdoor and indoor water use per\nperson, household or hectares \n†  Average increase/decrease of green spaces and trees \nMany of these indicators are already being monitored and\nmany of the currently used indicators can be used to assess the\n\neffectiveness of the implemented adaptation measures.  \nSTEP 5: METHODS AND ACTIONS\nTo proceed with this step, we suggest using the following list of questions:\n1.Identify emerging development challenges and policies that have the potential to create new vulnerabilities with regard\nto climate change2.Assess new information as it becomes available that could provide insight into or change best practices in local planning\nprocesses\n3.Identify the aspects of the project that require follow-up and monitoring.

This communication\n\ncan also help to identify future opportunities and initiatives\n\nto tackle climate change and promote sustainability. These\n\nnew projects may require involvement of new stakeholders\n\nsuch as representatives of other levels of government,\n\nneighbouring communities, non-governmental organizations\n\nor professional organizations. \nExamples of SAM Actions\nThe following tables list a number of adaptation actions\napplicable to varioussectors.

BrainstormingBrainstorming is a popular technique used to generate ideas\nin a group. The basic rules of brainstorming include a focus\n\non generating many ideas without evaluating the merits of\n\nthose ideasŠcritical judgment of ideas is reserved for a\n\nsubsequent step in the process. Accordingly, unusual ideas are\n\nwelcome, and there is an emphasis on building on and\n\nextending proposed ideas to come up with ever more creative\n\npossibilities (e.g.see What-if analyses)\nThe Pacific Northwest region in the United States faces\ncritical challenges to a mainly hydroelectric energy supply as\n\nsummer river flows decrease. In response to this problem, the\n\nUniversity of Washington™s Climate Impacts Group brought\n\ntogether utilities, government agencies and regional planning\n\nbodies for brainstorming sessions to develop ideas about\n\npossible ways to mitigate projected power shortages for the\n\nregion (Harden and Eilperin 2006). \nCase study The case study is an approach to investigate complex social\nphenomena within a real-life context, and can be used to\n\nexplore, describe or explain an observed situation. The use of\n\ncase studies is commonly to answer ﬁhowﬂ or ﬁwhyﬂ questions\n\nabout contemporary events where an understanding of how\n\nthe context relates to observed outcomes is desired (Yin\n\n2004). For example, case studies exploring the experiences of\n\nother local governments with designing and implementing\n\nclimate change adaptation strategies could provide valuable\n\ninsight into opportunities and constraints for your context.\n\nThis strategy can provide insight into how a real-life system\n\nmay react to climate change impacts or variability and to\n\nadaptation policies.Case studies are often included as part of developing novel\n\npolicy areas that an organization may have limited experience\n\nwith. A current project by the Canadian Institute of Planners\n\nand Natural Resources Canada is using a set of local case\n\nstudies to find better ways of integrating scientific\ninformation into the policy and planning process, and to\n\nsuggest best practices for use in climate change adaptation\nplanning by municipalities in Canada (Canadian Institute of\n\nPlanners 2008).\nAssessment of the cost of adaptation \nFor our purposes, the cost of adaptation refers to the cost of\nplanned policy initiatives designed to respond to climate\n\nchange impacts, and does not include unplanned or\nindividual adaptive actions. A combination of other methods\n\ndiscussed in this document can contribute to this assessment\nof the cost of adaptation to climate change, and this\nassessment begins by considering three questions: Adapt to\n\nwhat? Who or what adapts? And, how does adaptation occur?\n\n(Smit et al.1999). To answer the first question one needs to\n\nhave an idea of how conditions will change Œ for example,\n\nscenarios or storylines are needed to frame further analysis. In\n\nterms of who or what adapts, the system of interest needs to\n\nbe defined. Are you interested in looking at the entire\n\nmunicipality? A particular sector or type of infrastructure?\n\nFinally, costs of adaptation depend critically on the strategies\n\nchosen and the net costs or benefits of those measures. These\n\nshould be considered alongside the net costs or benefits of\n\nprojected climate change impacts, and the degree to which\n\nadaptation measures will provide adequate responses to those\n\nimpacts (see Assessments of the cost of inaction).

For the most part\n\nthese methods draw heavily on economic valuation methods\n\n(e.g.: see Cost-benefit analyses and Cost-effectiveness\n\nanalyses); however, other tools can also be used. A recent\n\nstudy of climate change adaptation options for water\nresources in the Okanagan also provided estimates of the cost\n\nof various adaptation measures (Cohen and Neale, 2006).\nAssessments of the cost of inaction\nThere are costs associated with implementing adaptation\nmeasures and there are costs associated with choosing to not\n\ntake proactive measures to adapt. The cost of inaction refers\n\nto the net costs that would be incurred due to climate change\n\nimpacts in the absence of proactive adaptation measures. This\n\nis an important part of understanding and communicating\n\nwith the public about the potential costs of maintaining the\nstatus quo: inaction is not neutral, rather it implies costs that\nwill be borne sometime in the future (e.g. see Role of\n\ndiscounting).Estimating the cost of inaction requires an understanding of\nthe current situation and drivers, projecting changes in\n\nsocioeconomic and climatic systems, interpreting those\n\nchanges into expected impacts and then estimating economic\nvalues for those impacts. Estimates vary greatly depending on\n\nthe approach and assumptions chosen for the analysis,\n\nparticularly due to difficulties both in estimating physical\n\nimpacts and in assigning an economic value to those impacts.\n\nA recent technical report by the European Environmental\n\nAgency provides an overview of the methodologies for cost of\n\nadaptation and cost of inaction, together with examples of\nestimates (European Environmental Agency, 2007).\nCost-benefit analyses\nCBA is a quantitative approach that can be applied to\ndetermine the costs and benefits of a course of action in\nmonetary terms. Three objectives may be evaluated: whether\n\nbenefits outweigh the costs, whether net benefits are\n\nmaximized, and which of multiple options presents the most\n\nnet benefits. This is one of the more straightforward methods\n\nconceptually (although it is data-intensive) and is most\n\nappropriate for evaluating economic objectives or objectives\n\nthat can be meaningfully assessed in monetary terms. For\n\nassets that are not traded through the market (and hence have\nno dollar value), techniques have been developed for\nassigning monetary values in some cases, for example by\n\nasking what people would be willing to pay for that asset\n(Rothman et al.1999). Nonetheless, one of the significant\n\ndrawbacks of CBA is that its application is problematic when\n\nnon-monetary values such as social and environmental\n\nobjectives are also being evaluated, as in climate change\n\nstudies. There are also difficulties in valuing assets in the\n\nfuture versus their value in the present day (see Role of\n\ndiscounting).CBA is one of the most widely applied decision support tools.\nThe state of Maine in the United States used CBA to evaluate\n\nfour potential options for adapting to sea-level rise at a\n\nspecific study site, concluding in that case that it would be\nmore cost-effective to retreat from the shoreline as sea level\n\nrises, as opposed to protecting development and maintaining\n\nthe shoreline (USEPA 1995).\nCost-effectiveness analyses \nThis method is used to evaluate a single chosen objective soas to minimize the possible costs associated with its\n\nimplementation. In contrast with CBA, this analysis treats\n\nbenefits as fixed, and seeks only to find the least-cost strategy\n\nto achieve an objective. This method aims to provide a\n\nranking of the cost of different options for achieving the given\n\nobjective, and is most appropriate for evaluation of isolated\n\nprojects. Similar to CBA, this method is limited when non-\n\nmarket values need to be accounted for (see Cost-benefit\n\nanalyses). In climate change studies it is suggested that this technique\nbe used where a minimum level of a public good or service is\n\nrequired and the question is therefore how to achieve this\n\nobjective at a minimal cost. Flood protection could be an\n\nexample of such a service. In the United Kingdom, a cost-\n\neffectiveness analysis methodology was developed for\ndetermining whether options for achieving established water\nservice standards could be carried out at a reasonable cost\n\n(Risk and Policy Analysts Ltd. 2004).\nDecision analysis\nDecision Analysis is a formalized method for approaching\ndecision-making that employs a wide range of tools to\n\nstructure and evaluate choices to see how well options satisfy\n64CANADIAN COMMUNITIES’ GUIDEBOOK FOR ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE\nAPPENDIX 1guidebook livia-rev-final:Layout 1  12/23/08  9:25 AM  Page 64', 'objectives. This type of analysis begins with generating a\ncomprehensive list of options that could potentially address\n\nthe defined problem. Influence diagrams or decision trees are\n\nthen used to identify points where decisions would have to be\n\nmade, and where chance occurrences would influence the\n\ndirection of events. The likelihood of chance events is then\n\nevaluated, and the utility of different outcomes is calculated.\n\nA final step uses specific criteria to determine which set of\noptions has the greatest potential to achieve desired\n\noutcomes.Decision analysis has been applied to evaluate intersecting\nissues of adaptation, mitigation and sustainable development\n\nin the context of BC™s Gateway Programme. The method\n\nallows a complex and contentious set of issues and objectives\n\nto be structured in a way that can enhance understanding\n\nand communication to aid in the decision-making process\n\n(Wilson and McDaniels, 2007).\nRole of discounting in assessments \nDiscounting is a method used in economic analyses to\ncompare the value of costs and benefits occurring at different\n\npoints in time. To calculate the value today, of something that\n\nwill exist in the future, a ﬁdiscount rateﬂ is used. A discount\n\nrate expresses the degree to which consumption today is\n\npreferred over consumption a year from nowŠthe higher the\n\ndiscount rate, the less value that is placed on that\n\nconsumption (or good, service, cost, benefit, etc) in the\n\nfuture. Discounting is an important consideration because of\n\nour tendency to value a cost or benefit in the present more\n\nthan that same cost or benefit in the future. However,\n\napplication in the context of climate change and sustainable\ndevelopment also begs consideration of preserving options\n\nfor future generations, which would imply quite a low\n\ndiscount rate.A recent and controversial application of discounting was the\nUnited Kingdom™s ﬁStern Reviewﬂ that was charged with\n\nevaluating the cost of climate change adaptation in\n\ncomparison to the cost of inaction, globally. Considerable\n\ndebate developed around the report™s conclusions, in part due\n\nto differing perspectives on whether the appropriate ﬁsocial\n\nrate of timeﬂ discount rate had been applied. This type of\n\ndiscount compares the value of well-being today to well-being\n\nof future generations. Stern chose to use a very low discount\n\nrate that values well-being in the future as virtually equal to\n\nwell-being today. While some defend this choice based on\nthe imperatives of sustainable development, it is ultimately\n\nan ethical choice, not a technical choice. Hence, others begin\n\nfrom different ethical assumptions and conclude that a higher\n\ndiscount rate would produce more appropriate results\n\n(Varian, 2006).\nDownscaling techniques Downscaling is the process of deriving local or regional scale\nclimate information from models or data at a larger scale. In\n\neffect, the larger climate is used as a predictor of the local\n\nclimate. There are two main types of downscaling techniques:\n\ndynamical and statistical. Dynamical downscaling uses the\n\ninputs of Global Climate Models (GCMs) in order to\n\ndevelop Regional Climate Models (RCMs). Statistical\n\ndownscaling combines large-scale climate variables with\n\nlocally observed variables (often from a specific weather\n\nstation) to produce a statistical model that is then used to\n\nproject future changes at a local scale. An advantage of\n\nstatistical downscaling is that it is less computationally\n\ndemanding than dynamical downscaling, although it still\n\nrequires a large amount of data to develop the model (Barrow\n\net al,2004; CCSN, 2007). \nThere are a variety of techniques that can be applied, as well\nas software that can assist in translating large-scale data to a\n\nlocal scale. The Canadian Climate Change Scenarios\n\nNetwork provides further information and software tools on\n\ntheir website (\nhttp://www.cccsn.ca\n). This method is\nincreasingly being applied in order to develop smaller-scale\n\nscenarios that can aid in developing climate change\n\nadaptation policies at a local or regional scale. \nUsing expert judgmentsExpert judgments are evaluations performed by people who\nhave a particular expertise relating to the question at hand.\n\nThe judgments can be of at least two types, and are\n\ncommonly a bit of both: that is, they may be issues of factual\njudgment (something that can be proven right or wrong) or\n\nof value judgment (expressing an opinion) that derives from\n\nexpert knowledge of the issue being evaluated. This is a\n\nroutine part of creating policy-relevant evaluations.\nOften expert judgment is done informally, although it is\nincreasingly a formalized component of studies on climate\n\nchange and associated uncertainty analyses. Two main ways\nCANADIAN COMMUNITIES’ GUIDEBOOK FOR ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE\n65APPENDIX 1guidebook livia-rev-final:Layout 1  12/23/08  9:25 AM  Page 65', 'that expert judgment can be applied formally are by pooling\nexpert judgments to achieve one combined result or by\n\npresenting a range of distinct judgments made by individual\n\nexperts. In the latter case a further process, such as consensus\n\nbuilding, will be needed in order to incorporate these\n\njudgments into societally acceptable decisions. A related\n\napproach is the Delphi technique, where expert judgments\n\nare contributed in a structured process to come up with joint\n\nforecasts (Willows and Connell, 2003).\nExpert judgment is used often in climate change studies\nwhere there is a lack of available data or where uncertainty is\n\nso great that other quantitative evaluations will not produce\n\na meaningful result. For example, where predictions of\n\ntechnological, social or political change are required for\n\nclimate change scenario development, formalized expert\n\njudgment may be the most reasonable way of estimating the\n\nnecessary parameters. Another common use of expert\n\njudgment in climate change studies is to estimate uncertainty\n\n(Otwayl et al.,1992; Webster et al.,2003).\nFacilitated workshops\nFacilitated workshops are a participatory method that\nincorporates the ideas, concerns and preferences of all\n\nparticipants in a structured decision-making process. The\n\ntechnique draws on Decision analysis methods and requires\n\nparticipants to apply information to develop ideas and\n\nprovide judgments on options. This often results in a ranking\n\nof policy options. It contributes to a learning process\n\nindividually and collectively that simultaneously incorporates\n\ndiverse beliefs and values to develop joint recommendations\n\non preferred actions.\nA series of facilitated workshops were used recently in the\nOkanagan as part of a participatory integrated assessment of\n\nwater management. This method was used in order to\n\nenhance learning and understanding of the issue among\nparticipants, and to jointly develop a decision support model\n\nthat is used to increase knowledge about the system and\n\nexplore plausible future scenarios and adaptation options\n\n(Cohenand Neale, 2006).\nFocus groups\nFocus groups are a method that brings together around six\nto ten selected participants representing groups or individuals\nwhose ideas and opinions are of particular interest for the\n\ndiscussion topic. This group is guided by a facilitator through\n\nan interactive discussion around specific questions in order to\n\nlearn from participants™ experience. The method is\n\ndistinguished from other group methods by its intentional\ninteraction between participants that can provide shared\n\ninsight and a diversity of understandings, and can be an\n\nefficient way of gathering responses with limited resources or\n\ntime. However, the very strength of this methodŠ\n\ninteractionŠmeans that special consideration needs to be\ntaken where sensitive topics are being discussed, or power\n\ndynamics between participants could constrain individual\n\nresponses (Morgan, 1996).\nFocus groups are used in a variety of settings for a range of\npurposes. For example, this technique is currently being used\n\nby Natural Resources Canada and professional planning\n\nassociations in development of a national planning policy on\n\nclimate change adaptation. Elsewhere, focus groups have been\n\nused in the prairies to understand agricultural producers™\n\nperceptions of risks, opportunities and capabilities due to\n\nclimate change, as well as their ideas of what support will be\n\nrequired to manage risk (Stroh Consulting, 2005). \nMulti-criteria analyses \nMulti-Criteria Analysis (MCA) refers to any structured\nDecision analysis that evaluates preferred options for\n\naddressing a number of objectives simultaneously. This is\n\ndone by identifying desired objectives and corresponding\n\nindicators that can include social, economic, biophysical or\nother types of components. These indicators are often\n\nevaluated quantitatively, for example through ranking or\n\neconomic valuation; however, they will often not be in the\n\nsame units and may also include qualitative measures. MCA\n\nincludes techniques for comparing and evaluating outcomes\n\nwhile incorporating this range of types of indicators, and is\nparticularly useful where a method such as cost-benefit\n\nanalysis cannot be used due to the difficulties in assigning\nmonetary values to social or environmental objectives.\nThis approach has wide application. In Canada, it has been\nused to evaluate conflictual policy areas such as sustainable\n\nforestry options in B.C. that address a range of public\n\nobjectives (Sheppard and Meitner,2005), and evaluating\n\nalternative energy supply futures for the country (Noble,\n\n2004).66CANADIAN COMMUNITIES’ GUIDEBOOK FOR ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE\nAPPENDIX 1guidebook livia-rev-final:Layout 1  12/23/08  9:25 AM  Page 66', 'Policy exercise \nThis method brings together policy makers with academics tocombine knowledge from multiple disciplines for use in\n\ndeveloping policy to deal with complex management issues.\n\nKey components of the approach include proposing\n\nunconventional but plausible scenarios of the future, and\n\nthen developing and testing different policy options that\n\nrespond to the key challenges represented by the scenarios.\n\nThis method requires a significant investment of time and\n\ncapacity and incorporates a combination of mathematical or\ncomputer-based modeling and scenario analysis together with\ntechniques such as facilitated workshops and brainstorming.\n\nThe exercise is conducted in an organizational context that\n\nreflects real-world institutional issues of relevance to the\n\nproblem being discussed. This method can be used both to generate and evaluate\nadaptation options. The process does not necessarily result in\n\nnew knowledge or an explicit set of policy recommendations.\n\nRather, it can be used to identify priorities and gaps in\n\nknowledge, as well as institutional barriers or needed\n\ntechnological changes. In a case applying the policy exercise\n\n(PE) approach in southeast Asia, a combination of methods\n\nincluding data collection, modeling, impact assessments and\nbackground scenarios were used in preparation for the policy\n\nexercise workshops. This experience demonstrated the\n\nusefulness of PE for effectively structuring the issues involved\n\nin order to develop appropriate adaptation policy options\n\n(McCarthy et al.,2001).\nScenario development and analyses \nSynthetic and analogue scenarios, in addition to Global\nClimate Model (GCM) scenarios, are methods for exploring\n\npossible changes in future climates (See Barrow et al.,2004,\n\nSection 6.4). Synthetic scenarios, also known as ﬁarbitraryﬂ\n\nor ﬁincrementalﬂ scenarios, are the simplest climate change\n\nscenarios to construct and apply. This is done by using\n\nhistorical climate records and altering a climate variable by\n\nan arbitrary amount to see how it affects the system.\n\nAccordingly, its main use is in sensitivity analysis, to gain a\n\nbetter understanding of how changes to a certain variable may\n\nimpact a system. It can also be used to identify thresholds\n\nand the tolerance of the system to changes in climate.Analogue scenarios use existing climate information, eitherfrom the site being studied (ﬁtemporalﬂ analogue) or from\nanother location whose current climate is similar to that\n\nexpected for the study site in the future (ﬁspatialﬂ analogue).\n\nA strength of temporal analogues is that, because the climate\n\nwas experienced in the past, it is physically plausible that it\ncould occur in the future. While the same is partly true for\n\nspatial analogues, the transferability of climate data from one\n\nlocation to another is limited due to geographical differences\n\nbetween locations (e.g: day length, proximity to water, etc).\n\nFor both types of scenarios, a key limitation is that using\n\nanalogues as a basis for future scenarios assumes that the\n\nclimate will continue to respond the same way in the future\n\nas it has in the past. Global climate models (GCMs) are a\n\nmore reliable approach for developing future scenarios for use\n\nin impact assessments.The other side of scenario development concerns the\nsocioeconomic context and drivers for climate impact\n\nassessment. This may be done by developing plausible\n\nﬁstorylinesﬂ that describe social, economic, technological and\n\npolitical changes that will have a bearing on emissions, future\n\nconditions and adaptation possibilities. As it is impossible to\npredict trajectories for socioeconomic scenarios, these are\n\noften expressed as possible alternative futures. For the United\n\nKingdom Climate Impacts Programme, four socioeconomic\n\nscenarios were developed alongside climate scenarios in order\n\nto produce an integrated climate impact assessment.\n\nSocioeconomic scenario development is also useful for\n\npromoting social learning about climate change impacts in\n\nthe community (Berkhout et al.,2002).\nScenario analysis is a systematic evaluation using expert\njudgment and scientific methods to identify a range of\npossible outcomes that could occur, taking into account key\n\ndrivers and the uncertainty surrounding them. This is the\n\nmethod used in the IPCC reports to develop future climate\n\nscenarios. In California, scenario analysis was used to explore\n\npossible energy futures, identify potential challenges and\n\nstrategies, and make policy recommendations for the state\n\n(Ghanadan and Koomey, 2005).\nSensitivity analyses\nSensitivity analysis is a technique that looks at how sensitive a\nsystem is to climate variability or change. For example, how\n\ndoes the system respond to an increase of 2°C in average surface\n\ntemperature? Synthetic scenarios are one example of a sensitivity\n\nanalysis. Sensitivity analysis can also be used in estimating the\n\nuncertainty of outcomes (see Uncertainty analyses). \nCANADIAN COMMUNITIES’ GUIDEBOOK FOR ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE\n67APPENDIX 1guidebook livia-rev-final:Layout 1  12/23/08  9:25 AM  Page 67', 'Sensitivity analysis was applied in a Canadian study to\nevaluate the impacts of climate change on drainage design\n\nmethods and on different types of drainage systems. Using\n\nthis method, they were able to investigate possible changes\n\nto variables,such as peak flow and runoff volume and how\n\nthese changes would affect components of the drainage\nsystem,including required pipe size or the cost of different\n\ndesign methods (Kije Sipi Ltd.,2001).\nTrade-off analyses\nTrade-off analysis is a form of integrated assessment that\nincorporates stakeholders, experts and policy makers in a\n\nprocess designed to provide policy-relevant information.\n\nThrough incorporation of relevant components of the social,\n\neconomic, decision-making and biophysical systems, this\napproach highlights the interactions between different\n\ncomponents of the system in order to describe tradeoffs\n\nassociated with different adaptation options. Various\n\nqualitative and/or quantitative methods may be employed in\n\nthe research process, including public consultations, focus\n\ngroups, expert judgment, and mathematical models.\n\nTradeoffs are identified between the components of interest.\n\nFor example, these could be tradeoffs between different\n\nsectors of society, between environmental, social and\n\neconomic objectives, or between adaptation and mitigation\n\npolicies. These tradeoffs are then presented publicly in various\n\nforms, for example as tradeoff curves, maps or risk diagrams,\n\nto be used in decision-making (Stoorvogel et al.,2004).\nThis approach was applied in a case in the Philippines to\nevaluate tradeoffs in climate change adaptation options for a\n\nspecific watershed. This study examinedtradeoffs between\n\nkey sectors of society in order to identify potential synergies\n\nand conflicts between different adaptation options. This\n\nprovided insights into which policy options may have positive\n\nimpacts on multiple sectors and which may have negative\n\nconsequences.Thus allowing policy to be directed towards\n\noptimizing synergies and proactively mitigating negative\n\neffects of adaptation strategies. This approach also helped to\n\nidentify early on some of the potential conflicts that could\narise (Lasco et al.,2006). \nUncertainty analyses\nTwo main sources of uncertainty for climate change policy\nderive from limitations on our knowledge of how the global\nclimate system works and our ability to model it, and the\n\nuncertainties present in predicting the course of human\n\nactions in the future (e.g. policydecisions, demographics,\n\neconomics, technology, etc). While efforts are constantly\n\nbeing made to reduce uncertainties around climate change\n\nscience and modeling, uncertainty will always be an\n\nimportant component informing climate change policy.\n\nRather than becoming a source of indecision, this must be\nrecognized and analyzed so as to best understand and\n\ncommunicate the areas of uncertainty that have a bearing on\n\npolicy decisions. Uncertainty analysis is therefore an integral part of any\nclimate change assessment. This analysis can also be used to\n\ndescribe different types and degrees of uncertainty relating to\n\npolicy options, or to assign relative likelihoods to various\n\nscenarios and present a selection of most likely scenarios. The\n\npurpose is to provide an informed basis for decision-makers\n\nand the public to begin consideration of appropriate policy\n\noptions for adaptation and mitigation (Webster,2003). For\n\nexample, in the IPCC Fourth Assessment report uncertainty\n\nanalysis is used to provide judgments of relative likelihoods\n\nthat projected outcomes will occur, expressed in terms of the\n\nfollowing confidence levels:\n†  Very High confidence (at least 9 out of 10 chance of being\ncorrect)\n†  High confidence (about 8 out of 10 chance)\n†  Medium confidence (about 5 out of 10 chance)\n\n†  Low confidence (about 2 out of 10 chance)\n†  Very low confidence (less than 1 out of 10 chance)\nVulnerability assessment A starting point for planning for climate change adaptation\nis to conduct an assessment of the vulnerability of a\ncommunity™s human, natural and physical infrastructure to\n\nclimate variability and severe weather. Such an understanding\n\nprovides a basis for setting adaptation policy priorities by\n\nidentifying areas that require new policies or partnerships,\n\nand areas of emerging opportunities. Vulnerability assessment\n\nat a local level proceeds in five steps. First, parties that would\n\nbe affected by, and make decisions about, climate change for\n\na certain sector are brought together. Second, current\n\nvulnerabilities to severe weather events are identified by\n\nparticipants for all affected sectors. Third, future conditions\n68CANADIAN COMMUNITIES’ GUIDEBOOK FOR ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE\nAPPENDIX 1guidebook livia-rev-final:Layout 1  12/23/08  9:25 AM  Page 68', 'are estimated. Scenarios developed by experts on projected\nsocio-economic and climate changes are provided to\n\nparticipants who consider what economic, social and\n\nenvironmental impacts may occur as a result. In step four,\n\nfuture vulnerabilities are estimated based on these scenarios,\n\nand potential adaptation strategies are identified. The final\n\nstep is to evaluate options and their potential to reduce\n\nvulnerability, decide on preferred strategies and implement\n\nthem. Implementation requires ongoing monitoring and\n\nreview to ensure that adaptation approaches are responding\n\nto actual conditions and new information as it becomes\n\navailable (Lemmen and Warren, 2004). \nVulnerability assessment has been utilizedin BC to evaluate\nthe vulnerability of forestry-based communities to climate\n\nchange in places like Vanderhoof, BC (Natural Resources\n\nCanada, 2005).What-if analyses\nThere are a variety of types of this analysis, which begins with\nthe postulating of ﬁWhat if?ﬂ questions in a structured\n\nbrainstorming session. This is commonly used in risk\n\nmanagement to anticipate potential problems and suggest\n\nresponse strategies and ways of mitigating the risk. In climate\n\nchange studies,this technique can be used to initiate\n\ndiscussion about what impacts may occur under certain\n\nchanges in climate, and generate ideas of appropriate\n\nresponses. Example questions include,ﬁWhat if available\n\nwater supplies dropped by 20% during the summer? and\n\nWhat changes in water policy would be required for various\n\nuses, given this condition?ﬂ This technique could be used in\n\na focus group or workshop setting that gathers together\n\nexperts on the general subject area (e.g.agricultural \n\nor engineering experts) or the specific area of application \n\n(e.g.planners and engineers at the city).\nAPPENDIX 1CANADIAN COMMUNITIES’ GUIDEBOOK FOR ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE\n69guidebook livia-rev-final:Layout 1  12/23/08  9:25 AM  Page 69', 'appendix 2: understanding the consequences of\nclimate change impacts The important part of a climate change impact assessment should be not only obtaining information about changes in basic\nclimatic variables such as temperature and precipitation, but also information on what these changes mean for the resources,\n\ninfrastructure and vulnerability of areas relevant for the local government. This section outlines potential consequences of\n\nimpacts that changes in climate variables could pose on the community. From the viewpoint of adaptation and vulnerability\n\nreduction, these consequences are very important for the design of adaptation actions since they relate changes in climate\n\nvariables to socio-economic and ecological dimensions of local development.

Ways to achieve this\n\nobjective might include, e.g., farmer advice and\n\ninformation services, seasonal climate forecasting and\n\nincentives for development of irrigation systems. Measures\n\ncan be individual interventions or they consist of packages\n\nof related measures. Specific measures might include\n\nactions that promote the chosen policy direction, such as\n\nimplementing as irrigation project, or setting up a farmer\n\ninformation, advice and early warning programme. Both of\n\nthese measures would contribute to the national goal of\n\nfood security. (UNDP, 2005)\nAdaptation Policy Framework (APF):\nis a structural\nprocess for developing adaptation strategies, policies, and\nmeasures to enhance and ensure human development in the\n\nface of climate change, including climate variability. The\n\nAPF is designed to link climate change adaptation to\nsustainable development and other global environmental\n\nissues. It consists of five basic Components: scoping and\n\ndesigning an adaptation project, assessing current\n\nvulnerability, characterizing future climate risks, developing\nan adaptation strategy, and continuing the adaptation\n\nprocess. (UNDP, 2005)\nAdaptation Technology:\nA report by the UNFCCC\nSecretariat on a seminar on the development and transfer of\ntechnologies for adaptation to climate change states that\ndefining adaptation technologies is difficult. It suggests that\n\nan operational definition might be used for ﬁthe application\n\nof technology in order toreduce the vulnerability, or\n\nenhance the resilience, of a natural or human system to the\n\nimpacts of climatechangeﬂ. Technological approaches to\n\nadaptation include both ﬁhardﬂ technologies such as capital\n\ngoodsand hardware, as well as ﬁsoftﬂ technologies such as\n\nknowledge of methods and techniques which enableﬁhardﬂ\n\ntechnologies to be applied. (UNDP, 2005)\nAdaptive Capacity:\nThe ability of a system to adjust to climatechange (including climate variability and extremes) to moderate\n\npotential damages, to take advantage of opportunities, or to\n\ncope with the consequences. (IPCC, 2001)Anticipatory Adaptation:\nAdaptation that takes place\nbefore impacts of climate change are observed. Also referred\n\nto as proactive adaptation.\nAutonomous Adaptation: \nAdaptation that does not\nconstitute a conscious response to climatic stimuli but is\n\ntriggered by ecological changes in natural systems and by\n\nmarket or welfare changes in human systems. Also referred\n\nto as spontaneous adaptation.Base-Line Scenario:\nBaseline scenarios depict a future state\nof society and/or environment in which no new\nenvironmental policies are implemented apart from those\n\nalready in the pipeline today; or in which these policies do\n\nnot have a discernable influence regarding the questions\n\nbeing analysed. (European Environment Agency, 2008)  \nCapacity:\nA combination of all the strengths and resources\navailable within a community, society or organization that\ncan reduce the level of risk, or the effects of a disaster.\n\nCapacity may include physical, institutional, social or\neconomic means as well as skilled personal or collective\nattributes such as leadership and management. Capacity\nmay also be described as capability. (UN/ISDR, 2004)\nCatastrophic Event:\nA climate-related event having sudden\nonset and widely distributed and large magnitude impacts on\nhuman or natural systems, such as historically rapid sea level\n88CANADIAN COMMUNITIES’ GUIDEBOOK FOR ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE\nAPPENDIX 5guidebook livia-rev-final:Layout 1  12/23/08  9:26 AM  Page 88', 'rise or sudden shifts (over a decade or less) in atmospheric or\noceanic circulation patterns. Such events have occurred in the\n\npast due to natural causes (UNDP, 2005)\nClimate Change:Climate change refers to a statistically\nsignificant variation in either the mean state of the climate\n\nor in its variability, persisting for an extended period\n\n(typically decades or longer). Climate change may be due\nto natural internal processes or external forcings, or to\npersistent anthropogenic changes in the composition of the\n\natmosphere or in land use. The United Nations Framework\n\nConvention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), however,\n\ndoes make a distinction between ﬁclimate variabilityﬂ\n\nattributable to natural causes and ﬁclimate changeﬂ\n\nattributable to human activities altering the atmospheric\ncomposition. In the UNFCCC™s Article 1, ﬁclimate changeﬂ\n\nis defined as: ﬁa change of climate which is attributed\n\ndirectly or indirectly to human activity that alters the\n\ncomposition of the global atmosphere and which is in\n\naddition to natural climate variability observed over\n\ncomparable time periods.ﬂ (IPCC, 2001)Climate Feedback: \nThe influence of a climate-related\nprocess on another that in turn influences the original\nprocess. For example, a positive climate feedback is an\n\nincrease in temperature leading to a decrease in ice cover,\n\nwhich in turn leads to a decrease of reflected radiation\n\n(resulting in an increase in temperature). An example of a\n\nnegative climate feedback is an increase in the Earth™s\n\nsurface temperature, which may locally increase cloud\n\ncover, which may reduce the temperature of the surface.\n\n(IPCC, 2001)Climatic Hazards:\ninclude increasing frequency of extreme\nweather events (floods, hurricanes, tornados, droughts),\nincreasing summer temperatures, lower level of\n\nprecipitation during main growing seasons, changes in\n\nstreamflow, changes in snowfall\nClimate System:\nThe system consisting of the atmosphere\n(gases), hydrosphere (water), lithosphere (solid rocky part\nof the Earth), and biosphere (living) that determine the\n\nEarth™s climate. (NOAA,2005)\nClimate Variability:\nClimate variability refers to variations\nin the mean state and other statistics (such as standard\ndeviations, the occurrence of extremes, etc.) of the climate\n\non all temporal and spatial scales beyond that of individual\nweather events. Variability may be due to natural internal\n\nprocesses within the climate system (internal variability), or\n\nto variations in natural or anthropogenic external forces\n\n(external variability). (IPCC, 2001)\nClimate:Climate in a narrow sense is usually defined as the\n‚average weather™, or more rigorously, as the statistical\ndescription in terms of the mean and variability of relevant\n\nquantities over a period of time ranging from months to\n\nthousands or millions of years. Climate in a wider sense is\n\nthe state, including a statistical description, of the climate\nsystem. The classical period of time is 30 years, as defined\n\nby the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).\n\n(IPCC, 2001) Climatic Variable:\nQualitative classification of a weather\nelement (e.g. temperature, precipitation, wind, humidity,\netc.) at a place over a period of time. (NOAA, 2005)\nCoping Capacity: \nThe means by which people ororganizations use available resources and abilities to face\n\nadverse consequences that could lead to disaster. In general,\n\nthis involves managing resources, both in normal times as\n\nwell as during crises or adverse conditions. The\n\nstrengthening of coping capacities usually builds resilience\n\nto withstand the effects of natural and human-induced\nhazards (UN/ISDR 2004). Capacity refers to the manner\n\nin which people and organizations use existing resources to\n\nachieve various beneficial ends during unusual, abnormal,\n\nand adverse conditions of a disaster event or process. The\n\nstrengthening of coping capacities usually builds resilience\n\nto withstand the effects of natural and other hazards.\n\n(European Spatial Planning Observation Network)\nCritical Threshold: \nThe point at which an activity faces anunacceptable level of harm, such as a change from profit to\nloss on a farm due to decreased water availability, or coastal\n\nflooding exceeding present planning limits. It occurs when\n\na threshold q.v. is reached at which ecological or\n\nsocioeconomic change is damaging and requires a policy\n\nresponse. (UNDP, 2005)\nDevelopment Pathway:\nAn evolution based on an array of\ntechnological, economic, social, institutional, cultural andbiophysical characteristics that determine the interactions\nbetween human and natural systems, including production\nand consumption patterns in all countries, over time at a\n\nparticular scale. (IPCC, 2007)\nCANADIAN COMMUNITIES’ GUIDEBOOK FOR ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE\n89APPENDIX 5guidebook livia-rev-final:Layout 1  12/23/08  9:26 AM  Page 89', 'Extreme Event: \nAn extreme weather event refers to\nmeteorological conditions that are rare for a particular place\nand/or time, such as an intense storm or heat wave. An\n\nextreme climate event is an unusual average over time of a\n\nnumber of weather events, for example heavy rainfall over a\n\nseason.Extreme Weather Event: \nAn event that is rare within its\nstatistical reference distribution at a particular place.\nDefinitions of ﬁrareﬂ vary, but an extreme weather event\n\nwould normally be as rare as or rarer than the 10th or 90th\n\npercentile. By definition, the characteristics of what is\n\ncalled ﬁextreme weatherﬂ may vary from place to place. An\n\nﬁextreme climate eventﬂ is an average of a number of\n\nweather events over a certain period of time, an average\n\nwhich is itself extreme (e.g. rainfall over a season). (IPCC,\n\n2001)Global Circulation Models (CGMs):\nNumerical\nrepresentation of the atmosphere and its phenomena over\nthe entire Earth, using the equations of motion and\n\nincluding radiation, photochemistry, and the transfer of\n\nheat, water vapour, and momentum. (NSIDC,n.d.) \nHuman System:\nAny system in which humanorganizations play a major role. Often, but not always, the\nterm is synonymous with ﬁsocietyﬂ or ﬁsocial systemﬂ (e.g.\n\nagricultural system, political system, technological system,\neconomic system). (IPCC,2001)\nKyoto Protocol:\nThe Kyoto Protocol to the United\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change\n(UNFCCC) was adopted in 1997 in Kyoto, Japan, at the\n\nThird Session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) to\n\nthe UNFCCC. It contains legally binding commitments in\n\naddition to those included in the UNFCCC. Countries\nincluded in Annex B of the Protocol. Most Organization\n\nfor Economic Cooperation and Development countries and\n\ncountries with economies in transition agreed to reduce\n\ntheir anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions (carbon\n\ndioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons,\n\nperfluorocarbons, and sulphur hexafluoride) by at least 5%\n\nbelow 1990 levels in the commitment period 2008 to\n\n2012. The Kyoto Protocol entered into force on 16\n\nFebruary 2005. (IPCC, 2007)\nMainstreaming: \nA definition of ‚mainstreaming™ does not\nyet exist, although the term is widely used. It seems that\n\n‚mainstreaming™ is used interchangeably with ‚integration™.\nMainstreaming refers to the integration of adaptation\n\nobjectives, strategies, policies, measures or operations such\n\nthat they become part of the national and regional\n\ndevelopment policies, processes and budgets at all levels\nand stages (UNDP, 2005).\nMaladaptation:\nAny changes in natural or human systemsthat inadvertently increase vulnerability to climatic stimuli;\nan adaptation that does not succeed in reducing\n\nvulnerability but instead increases it. (IPCC, 2007)\nMitigation:\nThe promotion of policy, regulatory and\nproject-based measures that contribute to the stabilization or\nreduction of greenhouse gases concentration in the\n\natmosphere. Renewable energy programs, energy efficiency\n\nframeworks and substitution of fossil fuels are examples of\n\nclimate change mitigation measures. (The World Bank,n.d.)\nMitigative Capacity:\nA country™s ability to reduce\nanthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions or enhance natural\nsinks. ﬁAbilityﬂ refers to skills, competencies, fitness, and\n\nproficiencies that a country has attained which can\n\ncontribute to greenhouse gas emissions mitigation. The\n\nmain sets of factors influencing mitigative capacity are\n\ntechnological, economic, and institutional in character. The\n\neconomic factors include income, abatement cost and\nopportunity cost while the technological factors include the\n\nability to absorb existing climate-friendly technologies or to\ndevelop innovative ones. The institutional factors include\n\nthe effectiveness of government regulation, clear market\n\nrules, a skilled work force and public awareness. (Winkler\n\net al., 2007) Non-Climatic Hazards:\ninclude globalization and growing\ncompetition, deepening wealth gap, changing\ndemographics and population patterns, concerns aboutsocio-political insecurity, rapid technological change,\n\ndeclining natural resources, ecosystem services, natural\n\nhabitat and biodiversity, increasing level of pollutants in the\n\nnatural environment also affecting health  No Regret Adaptation Options:\nAdaptation options (ormeasures) that would be justified under all plausible future\n\nscenarios, including the absence of man-made climate\nchange. (Eales et al., 2006)Planned Adaptation\nŠAdaptation that is the result of a\ndeliberate policy decision, based on an awareness that\nconditions have changed or are about to change and that\n90CANADIAN COMMUNITIES’ GUIDEBOOK FOR ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE\nAPPENDIX 5guidebook livia-rev-final:Layout 1  12/23/08  9:26 AM  Page 90', 'action is required to return to, maintain, or achieve a\ndesired state.\nPotential Impacts:\nAll impacts that may occur given a\nprojected change in climate, without considering\nadaptation.Reactive Adaptation:\nAdaptation that takes place after\nimpacts of climate change have been observed.\n\nResilience: \nThe capacity of a system, community or societypotentially exposed to hazards to adapt, by resisting or\nchanging in order to reach and maintain an acceptable level\n\nof functioning and structure. This is determined by the\n\ndegree to which the social system is capable of organizing\n\nitself to increase its capacity for learning from past disasters\n\nfor better future protection and to improve risk reduction\n\nmeasures. (UN/ISDR, 2004)\nRisk (climate-related):\nis the result of interaction of\nphysically defined hazards with the properties of the\nexposed systems Œ i.e., their sensitivity or (social)\nvulnerability. Risk can also be considered as the\n\ncombination of an event, its likelihood, and its\n\nconsequences Œ i.e., risk equals the probability of climate\n\nhazard multiplied by a given system™s vulnerability (UNDP\n\n2005). Risk is the probability that a situation will produce\n\nharm under specified conditions. It is a combination of two\n\nfactors: the probability that an adverse event will occur; and\n\nthe consequences of the adverse event. Risk encompasses\n\nimpacts on human and natural systems, and arises from\n\nexposure and hazard. Hazard is determined by whether a\n\nparticular situation or event has the potential to cause\n\nharmful effects.Risk Management:\nThe implementation of strategies toavoid unacceptable consequences. In the context of climate\nchange adaptation and mitigation are the two broad\n\ncategories of action that might be taken to avoid\nunacceptable consequences. (UNDP, 2005)\nSensitivity:\nthe degree to which a system is affected, either\nadversely or beneficially, by climate-related stimuli. The\neffect may be direct (e.g., a change in crop yield in response\n\nto a change in the mean, range, or variability of\n\ntemperature) or indirect (e.g., damages caused by an\n\nincrease in the frequency of coastal flooding due to sea level\n\nrise) (IPCC, 2001)Socio-Economic Vulnerability: \nis an aggregate measure of\nhuman welfare that integrates environmental, social,\n\neconomic and political exposure to a range of harmful\n\nperturbations (UNDP, 2005).\nStakeholder:\nA person or an organization that has alegitimate interest in a project or entity, or would be\naffected by a particular action or policy. (IPCC, 2007)\nThreshold: \nAny level of a property of a natural or\nsocioeconomic system beyond which a defined or markedchange occurs. Gradual climate change may force a system\n\nbeyond such a threshold. Biophysical thresholds represent a\n\ndistinct change in conditions, such as the drying of a\n\nwetland, floods, breeding events. Climatic thresholds\n\ninclude frost, snow and monsoon onset. Ecological\n\nthresholds include breeding events, local to global\n\nextinction or the removal of specific conditions for survival.\n\nSocioeconomic thresholds are set by benchmarking a level\n\nof performance. Exceeding a socioeconomic threshold\n\nresults in a change of legal, regulatory, economic or cultural\n\nbehaviour. Examples of agricultural thresholds include the\n\nyield per unit area of a crop in weight, volume or gross\n\nincome. (Marsden Jacobs Associates, 2004)\nUNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on\nClimate Change):An international treaty adopted in\n1992, and entered into force in 1994, that sets an overall\n\nframework for intergovernmental efforts to address\n\nchallenges posed by climate change. It recognizes that the\n\nclimate system is a shared resource whose stability can be\n\naffected by industrial and other emissions of carbon dioxide\n\nand other greenhouse gases. Under theConvention,\n\ngovernments cooperate in preparing for adaptationto the\n\nimpacts of climate change, launch national strategies for\naddressing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to\n\nexpected impacts, and gather and share information on\n\ngreenhouse gas emissions, national policies and best\n\npractices. One hundred and ninety-two countries have\n\nratified their membership with UNFCCC and the Kyoto\n\nProtocol is an addition to this treaty. \nVulnerability: \nThe degree to which a system is susceptible\nto, or unable to cope with, adverse effects of climate\nchange, including climate variability and extremes.\n\nVulnerability is a function of the character, magnitude, and\n\nrate of climate variation to which a system is exposed, its\n\nsensitivity, and its adaptive capacity.

A vulnerability assessment starts by\n\nconsidering the factors that make people or the environment\nsusceptible to harm, i.e. access to natural and financial\nresources; ability to self-protect; support networks and so\n\non. (Tompkins et al., 2005)\nWeather:\nThe state of the atmosphere at a given time and\nplace with regard to temperature, air pressure, humidity,\nwind, cloudiness, and precipitation. The term weather is\n\nused mostly for conditions over short periods of time.\n\n(Environment Canada, 2008) \nWin-Win Options:\nAdaptation options that minimize\nharmful climate impacts and also have other social,\n\nenvironmental or economic benefits. (European\n\nEnvironment Agency,2005) For example, no-till farming\n\nwith residue mulching slows soil erosion and pollution\n\nrunoff, acting to adapt agriculture operations to extreme\n\nweather while also benefiting aquatic ecosystems,\n\nimproving agronomic productivity, contributing to food\n\nsecurity, and reducing demand for fertilization and\n\nirrigation.
