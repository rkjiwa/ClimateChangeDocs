['Protect Your Home \n  from Flooding \nLOW-COST PROJECTS YOU CAN DO YOURSELF \n', '                                    FLOODING IS THE MOST COMMON AND COSTLY DISASTER \nIN THE UNITED STATES AND CAN HAPPEN ANYWHERE. \nHowever, there are many ways to reduce your home™s risk of ˜ooding, \nand not all of them are dif˚cult or expensive. This guide brie˜y describes \n\nsome of the smaller, lower cost actions you can take yourself or with minor \n\nassistance from others. It also suggests places you can go to ˚nd more \n\ninformation about ˜ood mitigation techniques, including some of these. \nYou have many ˜ood mitigation options as a homeowner. As you begin \nto think about which might be the best for you and your home, consider \n\nfollowing these \nthree key steps\n: 1. Know Your Risk. \nAnywhere it can rain, it can ˜oodŒso we all live in a \n˜ood zone, and we all live with the risk of ˜ood damage to our property. Learn \n\nmore details about your home™s level of ˜ood risk, including the type of ˜ood \n\nzone it is in and, if available, the potential ˜ood elevation (referred to as the \n\nﬁbase ˜ood elevationﬂ on a ˜ood map). A good place to start is FEMA™s online \n\nFlood Map Service Center at \n. You can also visit the \nof˚cials in your community who maintain the FEMA ˜ood maps and elevation \n\ncerti˚cates; they may work in the local planning and zoning of˚ce or in the \n\nbuilding department. Talk to them, your neighbors, and others about any past \n\n˜ood events and how high the water has risen in the past at or near your home. \n2. Insure Your Property.\n As a homeowner, it™s important to insure your home \nand personal belongings. Even if your home is in a low- or moderate-risk ˜ood \n\nzone, purchasing a ˜ood insurance policy is highly recommended. It provides \n\nyou with ˚nancial protection from a ˜ood event. Flood damage isn™t covered by \n\nstandard homeowners insurance policies, and just a few inches of ˜oodwater \n\ncan end up costing thousands of dollars in repairs. More than 25 percent \n\nof ˜ood insurance claims come from properties that are not in an identi˚ed \n\nhigh-risk zone, but most homeowners in these areas are eligible for coverage \n\nat a preferred rate. Preferred Risk Policy premiums are the lowest premiums \n\navailable, offering building and contents coverage for one low price. \n3. Reduce Your Risk. \nDecide how to prepare your family and protect your \nhome from ˜ooding. Consider which of the methods included in this guide are \n\nmost appropriate and practical, based on your home™s ˜ood risk, and create \n\na plan to mitigate the risk to your property. Even after a mitigation project, \n\nsome risk will remain, so learn about more actions to prepare and protect \n\nyour family, home, and belongings at \nwww.msc.fema.gov/portal\n/www.ready.gov/make-a-plan\n. ', '                \n                           Pl\nease be aware that ˜ood mitigation measures need to be \ntailored to the property in question. Depending on the project, \nyou may need to consult local architects, engineers, contractors, \n\nlandscapers, or other experts in design and construction. Also, \n\nchanges to properties and buildings often require permits or other \n\nregulatory approvals. Your local planning and zoning of˚ce or \n\nbuilding department is a good place to start for advice on how to \n\nbest proceed. Lastly, please remember to be kind to your neighbors! \n\nConsulting adjacent property owners is very important when \n\nany actions on your property, such as extending downspouts or \n\nregrading areas between homes, could affect their property. \nOUTSIDE THE HOME \nFor the exterior areas of your property, consider taking the \n\nfollowing actions: \nŁ Maintain proper water runoff and drainage. \nRoutinely clean and \nmaintain gutters, downspouts, and splashpads so that rainwater from your \n\nroof ˜ows easily away from your home. Also, make sure that any nearby \n\ndrainage ditches or storm drains are clear of debris and functioning \n\nproperly. \nŁ Improve lot grading. \nDetermine how water ˜ows or accumulates \n\naround your home to identify potential trouble spots (often easy to see \n\nduring an average rainstorm). Stormwater should always drain away from \n\nthe building; if necessary, change your landscaping to improve runoff. \n\nThis may include building up any sunken areas around the foundation, \n\ndigging small depressions to properly channel water, and otherwise \n\nimproving the yard so that it slopes away from your home. \nŁ Reduce impervious surfaces around your home.\n Water runs off \nconcrete and asphalt almost immediately and can exceed the capacity \n\nof storm sewers quickly during heavy rains. Retaining and creating \n\nnatural green space around your home can help reduce sewer over˜ows \n\nby reducing stormwater runoff. Consider options such as rain gardens, \n\nvegetated swales, or pervious pavements, which allow more water to be \n\nabsorbed by the ground. \nŁ Install a rain barrel.\n A rain barrel is an alternative method for \n\ndealing with rainwater. Rain barrels are typically connected to gutter \n\ndownspouts and collect the runoff from roofs. You can use this stored \n\nwater for non-potable uses such as watering the lawn and gardens or \n\nwashing your car. \nŁ Elevate utilities and service equipment. \nRaise and anchor air \n\nconditioning condensers, heat pumps, water meters and other service \n\nequipment onto pedestals or platforms that are at least 1 foot above \n\nthe potential ˜ood elevation. For identi˚ed high-risk zones this means \n\ngoing to or above the regulatory ˜ood elevation for the property as \n\nadopted by the local community. This inexpensive action can help \n\nprevent signi˚cant damage and disruption following a ˜ood event. \nŁ Anchor outdoor fuel tanks.\n Attach outdoor fuel tanks to a large \n\nconcrete slab that weighs enough to resist the force of ˜oodwaters, \n\nor install inexpensive ground anchors that are connected across \n\nthe top of the tank with metal straps. Unanchored fuel tanks can be \n\neasily moved and ruptured by ˜oodwaters and pose serious threats to \n\npeople, property, and the environment. If located in an identi˚ed high-\n\nrisk zone, fuel tanks should also be elevated to or above the regulatory \n\n˜ood elevation as adopted by the local community. If not feasible then \n\nall ˚lling and ventilation tubes should be elevated so that ˜oodwaters \n\ncannot enter the tank. \n', '                              \n          INSIDE THE HOME \nFor interior areas below the potential ˜ood elevation, consider \nmaking the following alterations: \nŁ Protect your valuable possessions.\n Move important documents and \nother valuable or sentimental items to a safer location, well above the \n\npotential ˜ood elevation and/or inside watertight containers. \nŁ Seal your foundation and basement walls. \nClose any foundation \n\ncracks with mortar and masonry caulk or hydraulic cement, which \n\nexpands and ˚lls gaps completely. Seal walls in your basements with \n\nwaterproo˚ng compounds to avoid seepage. Make sure any ˜oor drains \n\nare clear of obstructions. \nŁ Install ˜ood vents. \nFlood vents are small permanent openings that \n\nallow ˜oodwater to ˜ow freely through an enclosure such as a crawlspace \n\nor garage. Properly positioned and installed ˜ood vents protect homes \n\nduring ˜oods by preventing water pressure buildup that can destroy walls \n\nand foundations. Flood openings may be required for lower enclosures of \n\nhomes being built in high-risk ˜ood zones, but they can also be installed in \n\nexisting homes. Once installed, make sure your ˜ood vents are kept free \n\nof debris and will allow the free-˜ow of ˜oodwater. \nŁ Install a sump pump. \nSump pumps, which pump groundwater away \n\nfrom your home, can be an excellent defense against basement seepage \n\nand ˜ooding. They draw in the groundwater from around the house \n\nand direct it away from the structure through drainage pipes. Be sure \n\nto choose a device with battery-operated backup, in case of electrical \n\npower failure. \nŁ Prevent sewer backups.\n Install drain plugs for all basement ˜oor \ndrains to prevent sewer backups. Another recommended option, \n\nregardless of the potential ˜ood elevation, is to install sewer back˜ow \n\nvalves for all pipes entering the building. These devices, which allow \n\nwater to ˜ow only one direction, prevent ˜oodwater and wastewater from \n\nbacking up into your home through toilets, sinks, and other drains. They \n\nare available in a variety of designs that range from simple to complex, \n\nbut they should be installed by a quali˚ed, licensed plumber. \n', '      \n     \n     \n   \n                       \n   \n  \n    \n   \n    \n Ł Use ˜ood-resistant building materials. \n\nŠ Replace wooden ˜oorboards and carpets with ceramic tile, vinyl, \nrubber, or other ˜ood-resistant materials. Use moveable rugs instead \nof ˚tted carpets. \nŠ Replace internal walls and ceilings with ˜ood-resistant material such \nas lime plaster, cement board, concrete, or pressure-treated and \n\ndecay-resistant wood. \nŠ Replace wooden doors and window frames with metal or other ˜ood-\nresistant options. \nŁ Raise electrical system components.\n Increase the height of electric \nservice panels (fuse and circuit breaker boxes) and all outlets, switches, \n\nand wiring to at least 1 foot above the potential ˜ood elevation. These \n\nmodi˚cations should be made by a licensed electrician. \nŁ Protect utilities and service equipment. \nMove the main parts \n\nof your heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems to \n\na higher ˜oor or the attic. Consider raising other major appliances, \n\nsuch as washers, dryers, and hot water heaters, above the ground \n\n˜oor. If relocation or elevation is not possible, you can protect service \n\nequipment in place using low ˜oodwalls and shields. Alternative \n\noptions such as replacing traditional hot water heaters with tankless \n\nunits should also be considered. \nŁ Anchor indoor fuel tanks. \nAnchor fuel tanks by attaching them to \n\na large concrete slab that weighs enough to resist the force \n\nof ˜oodwaters. \nŁ Install a ˜ood alert system.\n A variety of ˜ood sensors and other early \n\nwarning devices can alert you to the risk of imminent ˜ooding so that \n\nyou can take preventative or protective actions before extensive damage \n\noccurs (see ﬁFlood Preparednessﬂ). \nFLOOD PREPAREDNESS \nYou may be able to take additional actions immediately before an \n\nexpected ˜ood event that will prevent or reduce ˜ood damage to \n\nyour home: \nŁ Activate ˜ood protection devices (turn on sump pumps, close back˜ow \nvalves, etc.). \nŁ Shut off electricity at the breaker panel. \nŁ Safeguard important paperwork and move furniture, rugs, electronics, \n\nand other valuable belongings to upper ˜oors, or at least off the ˜oor of \n\nthe ground level. \nŁ Elevate major appliances onto concrete blocks. \nŁ Clean gutters, downspouts, and splash pads, along with any nearby \n\ndrainage ditches or storm drains; clear snow and ice away from \n\nfoundations. \nŁ Deploy temporary ˜ood barriers, such as portable ˜ood gates or shields, \n\nsandbags, in˜atable ˜oodwalls, and ˜ood skirts. \n', '        \n      WANT TO LEARN MORE? \nContact your local community of˚cials.
