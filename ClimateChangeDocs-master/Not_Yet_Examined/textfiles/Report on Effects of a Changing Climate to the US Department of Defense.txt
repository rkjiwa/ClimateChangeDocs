Conclusion\ns Background\n  The\n effects\n of a changing\n climate\n are\n a national\n security\n issue\n with\n potential\n impacts\n to Department\n of Defense\n (DoD\n or the\n Department\n) missions,\n operational\n plans,\n and\n installations\n.  Our\n 2018 National\n Defense\n Strategy\n prioritizes\n long\n-term\n strategic\n competition\n with\n great\n power\n competitors\n by focusing\n the\n Department\n™s efforts\n and\n resources\n to:  1) build\n a more\n lethal\n force,\n 2) strengthen\n alliances\n and\n attract\n new\n partne\nrs,\n and\n 3) reform\n the\n Department™\ns processes\n.  To achieve\n these\n goals,\n DoD\n must\n be able\n to adapt\n current\n and\n future\n operati\nons to address\n the\n impacts\n of a variet\ny of threats\n and\n conditions,\n including\n those\n from\n weather\n and\n natural\n events\n.  To that\n end,\n DoD\n factors\n in the\n effects\n of the\n environment\n into\n its mission\n planning\n and\n execution\n to build\n resilience\n.  For\n this\n report,\n the\n Office\n of the\n Secretary\n of Defense\n requested\n information\n and\n inputs\n from\n the\n Military\n Departments,\n Joint\n Staff,\n Geographic\n Combata\nnt Commands,\n and\n other\n organizations.\n  Planning\n Handbook\n on Climate\n Change\n Installation\n Adaptation\n and\n Resilience\n Œ In January\n 2017, Naval\n Facilities\n Engineering\n Command\n released\n a handbook\n for\n use\n by planners\n in assessing\n climate\n impacts\n and\n evaluating\n adaptation\n options\n to consider\n in the\n existing\n Installation\n Development\n Plan\n (Master\n Plan)\n process\n.

Examples\n of Vulnerabilities\n to DoD\n Installations\n and\n Infrastructure\n  The\n section\ns below\n provide\n examples\n of impacts\n to the\n selected\n military\n installations\n.  Each\n section\n below\n includes\n a brief\n general\n description\n of the\n vulnerability\n factor\n and\n possible\n impacts\n to military\n installations\n or infrastructure\n followed\n by example\ns.  Recurrent\n Flooding\n  Vulnerabilities\n to installations\n include\n coastal\n and\n riverine\n flooding\n.  Coastal\n flooding\n may\n result\n from\n storm\n surge\n during\n severe\n weather\n events\n.  Over\n time,\n gradual\n sea\n level\n changes\n magnify\n the\n impacts\n of storm\n surge,\n and\n may\n eventually\n result\n in permanent\n inundation\n of property\n.  Increasing\n coverage\n of land\n from\n nuisance\n flooding\n during\n high\n tide\ns, also\n called\n ﬁsunny\n dayﬂ\n flooding\n, is already\n affecting\n many\n coastal\n communities\n.  Joint\n Base\n Langley\n-Eustis\n (JBLE\n-Langley\n AFB)\n, Virginia,\n has\n experienced\n 14 inches\n in sea\n level\n rise\n since\n 1930 due to localized\n land\n subsidence\n and\n sea\n level\n rise.\n  Flooding\n at JBLE\n-Langley,\n with\n a mean\n sea\n level\n elevation\n of three\n feet,\n has\n become\n more\n frequent\n and\n severe.\n  Navy\n Base\n Coronado\n experiences\n isol\nated\n and\n flash\n flooding\n during\n tropical\n storm\n events,\n particularly\n in El Niño\n years\n.  Upland\n Special\n Areas\n are\n subject\n to flash\n floods\n.  The\n main\n installation\n reports\n worsening\n sea\n lev\nel rise\n and storm\n surge\n impacts\n that\n include\n access\n limitations\n and\n other\n logistic\n related\n impairments.\n                                                   3 This\n table\n was\n updated\n to assign\n NGIC\n to the\n Army,\n changing\n the\n total\n number\n of Army\n installations\n to 21 and\n removing\n the\n ﬁNGAﬂ\n category\n and\n correcting\n language\n in the\n report,\n as well\n as the\n Appendix.\n ', ' 6  Navy\n Region\n Mid\n-Atlantic\n and\n the\n greater\n Hampton\n Roads\n area\n is one of the\n most\n vulnerable\n to flooding\n military\n operational\n installation\n areas\n in the\n United\n States\n.  Sea\n level\n rise,\n land\n subsidence,\n and\n changing\n ocean\n currents\n have\n resulted\n in more\n frequent\n nuisance\n flooding\n and\n increased\n vulnerability\n to coastal\n storms\n.  As a result\n, and\n to better\n mitigate\n these\n issues,\n the\n Region\n has\n engaged\n in several\n initiatives\n and\n partners\nhips\n to address\n the\n associated\n challenges\n.  Drought\n  Drought\n can negatively\n impact\n U.S\n. militar\ny installations\n in various\n ways,\n particularly\n in the\n Southwest\n.  For\n example,\n dry\n conditions\n from\n drought\n impact\n water\n supply\n in areas\n dependent\n on surface\n water\n.  Additionally,\n droughts\n dry\n out vegetation,\n increasing\n wildfire\n potential/severity\n.  Specific\n to military\n readiness,\n droughts\n can\n have\n broad\n implications\n for\n base\n infrastructure,\n impair\n testing\n activities,\n and\n along\n with\n increased\n temperature,\n can increase\n the\n number\n of black\n flag\n day\n prohibitions\n for\n testing\n and\n training\n.  Drought\n can contr\nibute\n to heat\n-related\n illnesses\n, including\n heat\n exhaustion\n and\n heat\n stroke,\n outlined\n by the\n U.S\n. Army\n Public\n Health\n Center\n.  Energy\n consumption\n may\n increase\n to provide\n additional\n cooling\n for\n facilities\n.  Several\n DoD\n sites\n in the\n DC area\n (including\n Joint\n Base\n Anacostia\n Bolling\n, Joint\n Base\n Andrews,\n U.S\n. Naval\n Observatory/Naval\n Support\n Facility,\n and\n Washington\n Navy\n Yard)\n periodically\n experience\nd drought\n conditions\n Œextreme\n in 2002 and\n severe\n from\n 2002 through\n 2018.  In addition,\n Naval\n Air\n Station\n Key\n West\n experienced\n drought\n in 2015\n and\n 2011, ranging\n from\n extreme\n to severe\n, respectively\n.  These\n examples\n highlight\n that\n drought\n conditions\n may\n occur\n in places\n not typica\nlly\n perceived\n as drought\n regions\n.   Drought\n conditions\n have\n caused\n significant\n reduction\n in soil\n moisture\n at several\n Air\n Force\n bases\n resulting\n in deep\n or wide\n cracks\n in the\n soil,\n at times\n leading\n to ruptured\n utility\n lines\n and\n cracked\n road\n surfaces.\n  Desert\nification\n   Des\nertification\n poses\n a number\n of challenges\n related\n to training\n and\n maneuvers\n. Desertification\n results\n in reductions\n in vegetation\n cover\n leading\n to increases\n in the\n amount\n of runoff\n from\n precipitation\n events\n.  Greater\n runoff\n contributes\n to:   higher\n erosion\n rates\n  increased\n stream\n sediment\n loads\n  deposition\n of sediment\n in unwanted\n areas\n  This\n reduce\ns the\n effectiveness\n of flood\n risk\n management\n infrastructure\n while\n increasing\n the\n potential\n for\n siltation\n of water\n supply\n reservoirs\n.  Following\n rain,\n eroded\n soil\n may\n be less\n suitable\n for\n native\n vegetation,\n resulting\n in bare\n land\n or revegetation\n with\n non-native,\n weedy\n species\n.  In cases\n where\n this\n results\n in the\n expansion\n of shrub\n-lands,\n this\n could\n affect\n the\n suitability\n of the\n landscape\n for\n military\n man\neuvers\n and\n off\n-road\n use.\n   Army\n installations\n Camp\n Roberts\n in San\n Miguel,\n California,\n and\n White\n Sands\n Missile\n Range\n in New\n Mexico\n were\n identified\n as vulnerable\n to current\n and\n future\n desertification,\n which\n ', ' 7  accelerate\ns erosion\n and\n increases\n soil\n fragility,\n possibly\n limiting\n future\n training\n and\n testing\n exercises\n.  Air\n Force\n bases\n in western\n states,\n including\n Kirtland,\n Creech,\n Nellis,\n and\n Hill\n were\n also\n identified\n as vulnerable\n to current\n and\n future\n desertification\n.   Wildfires\n  Due\n to routine\n training\n and\n testing\n activities\n that\n are\n significant\n ignition\n sources\n, wildfires\n are\n a constant\n concern\n on many\n military\n installations\n.  As a result,\n the\n DoD\n spends\n considerable\n resources\n on claims,\n asset\n loss,\n and\n suppression\n activitie\ns due to wildfire\n.  While\n fire\n is a key\n ecological\n process\n with\n benefits\n for\n both\n sound\n land\n management\n and\n military\n capabil\nity\n develo\npment,\n other\n clima\ntic factors\n including\n increased\n wind\n and\n drought\n can\n lead\n to an increased\n severity\n of wildfire\n activity\n.  This\n could\n result\n in infrastruc\nture\n and\n testing/training\n impacts.\n  In March\n 2018 two\n related\n wildfir\nes broke\n out in Colorado\n during\n an infantry\n and\n helicopter\n training\n exercise\n for\n an upcoming\n deployment\n.  Later\n determined\n to be due to live\n fire\n training\n, gusty\n winds\n and\n dry\n conditions\n allowed\n the\n fire\n to spread,\n reaching\n about\n 3,300 acres\n in size,\n destroying\n three\n homes,\n and\n causing\n the\n evacuation\n of 250 homes.\n  A wildfire\n in November\n 2017 burned\n 380 acres\n on Vandenberg\n Air\n Force\n Base\n in southern\n California\n.  While\n no structures\n were\n burned,\n the\n fire\n prompted\n evacuation\n of some\n personnel\n.  Firefighters\n from\n the\n U.S\n. Forest\n Service,\n Santa\n Barbara\n County,\n and\n other\n localities\n assisted\n the\n Vandenberg\n Fire\n Department\n in managing\n the\n fire\n.  The\n Canyon\n Wildfire\n at Vandenberg\n in September\n 2016 burned\n over\n 10,000\n acres\n and\n came\n very\n close\n to two\n Space\n Launch\n Complexes\n.  A scheduled\n rocket\n launch\n had\n to be delayed\n.  Several\n facilities\n on the\n south\n part\n of the\n base\n were\n operating\n on generators\n due to the\n loss\n of electrica\nl power\n lines\n.  Thawing\n Permafrost\n  Permafrost\n presents\n risks\n for\n critical\n built\n infrastructure\n.  Soil\n strength,\n ground\n subsidence,\n and\n stability\n are\n primarily\n affected\n by the\n phase\n change\n of ground\n ice\n to water\n at or near\n 0°C and\n when\n the\n soil\n thermal\n regime\n changes\n (by\n human\n activity,\n infrastructure\n emplacement,\n or sys\ntemic\n shifts\n related\n to weather).\n  Such\n subsidence\n may\n be rapid\n and\n catastrophic\n (days),\n very\n slow\n and\n systematic\n (decades),\n or somewhere\n in between\n.  Whether\n rapid\n or slow,\n thawing\n permafrost\n decreases\n the\n structural\n stability\n to foundations\n, buildings\n, and\n transportation\n infrastructure\n and\n requir\nes costly\n mitigation\n responses\n that\n disrupt\n planning,\n operatio\nns,\n and\n budgets.\n  In addition,\n thawing\n permafrost\n expo\nses\n coasts\n to increased\n erosion\n.  Permafrost\n underlays\n about\n 85 percent\n of Alaska;\n it is thickest\n north\n of the\n Brooks\n Range\n and\n gradually\n diminishes\n southward.\n  Permafrost\n thaw\n is relevant\n to DoD\n training\n and\n testing\n needs.\n  Thermokarst\n, which\n is a type\n of landscape\n that\n results\n from\n thawing\n permafrost,\n increases\n wetland\n areas\n and\n creates\n more\n challenging\n terrain.\n  In Fort\n Greeley\n, Alaska,\n Army\n training\n ranges\n are\n built\n on, or are\n being\n planned\n in permafrost\n-dominated\n areas\n.  Predicting\n where\n this\n phenomenon\n occurs\n and\n how permafrost\n might\n change\n is vital\n to maintaining\n training\n operations\n and\n assessing\n impending\n environm\nental\n management\n challenges\n.

In May\n 2016, DoD updated\n Directive\n 4170.11\n on Installation\n Energy\n Management\n and\n developed\n Installation\n Energy\n Plan\n guidance\n that\n included\n a focused\n goal\n of increased\n energy\n resilience\n and\n critical\n energy\n infrastructure\n requirements\n.  In February\n 2017,\n the\n Army\n added\n water\n to this\n effort\n and\n released\n guidance\n to establish\n requirements\n for\n Army\n energy\n and\n water\n security\n to enhance\n resilience\n on Army\n installations\n.

At United\n States\n Central\n Command\n, current\n and\n historic\n climate\n conditions\n are\n factored\n into\n theater\n campaign\n plans,\n including\n water\n scarcity\n which\n is a recurring\n issue\n in the\n region\n.  Warning\n indicators\n are\n part\n of the\n deliberate\n planning\n process\n.  United\n States\n Northern\n Command\n routinely\n includes\n severe\n weather\n-driven\n scenarios\n in training\n and\n exercise\n events\n and\n has\n developed\n planning\n tools\n to guide\n operational\n response\n efforts\n to these\n scenarios\n.  United\n States\n Indo\n-Pacific\n Command\n (USINDOPACOM)\n focuses\n their\n training\n on readiness\n to respond\n to and\n be resilient\n to natural\n disasters,\n as well\n as sustainable\n resource\n management\n toward\n critical\n resources\n scarcity\n.  This\n command\n has\n also\n established\n Pacific\n Augmentation\n Teams\n around\n its Area\n of Responsibility\n to identify\n quickly\n immediate\n needs\n that\n can\n be met\n with\n military\n assets.\n  United\n States\n Southern\n Command\n funded\n a National\n Preparedness\n Baseline\n Assessments\n to include\n a gap\n analysis\n as well\n as a five\n-year\n plan\n to build\n capability\n and\n capacity\n within\n the\n countries\n in the\n region\n.  The\n collection\n of sub\n-regional\n data\n will\n provide\n a more\n nuanced\n depiction\n of each\n country™s\n risks\n and\n vulnerabilities\n to disasters\n that\n may\n be influenced\n by climate\n as well\n as their\n readiness\n to respond\n to them\n.  This\n command\n will\n also\n seek\n appropriate\n ', ' 16  resources\n to fund\n assessments\n to determine\n the\n effects\n of its most\n serious\n and\n likely\n climate\n-related\n risks\n.  At USAFRICOM,\n climate\n impacts\n and\n drivers\n of instability\n and\n factional\n conflict\n are\n fully\n integrated\n into\n planning\n efforts\n.  Planners\n must\n consider\n the\n impacts\n of drought\n and\n desertification\n as high\n potential\n instability\n areas\n and\n how these\n two\n hazards\n impact\n bases\n and\n missions\n.  USAFRICOM™s\n capacity\n-building\n efforts\n are\n nested\n within\n its security\n cooperation\n programs\n and\n will\n adapt\n to a variety\n of trends\n and\n projections\n.  The\n Arctic\n Security\n Forces\n Roundtable\n is USEUCOM™s\n engagement\n effort\n for\n nations\n that\n have\n security\n forces\n within\n the\n Arctic\n region\n.  It is a forum\n in which\n senior\n military\n leaders\n from\n Arctic\n nations\n and\n other\n stakeholders\n confer\n and\n agree\n upon actions\n that\n can support\n stability\n and\n peaceful\n commercial\n activity\n in the\n region\n.  Lessons\n learned\n from\n our Arctic\n allies\n and\n partners\n are\n used\n to enhance\n operational\n safety\n.  In response\n to melting\n ice\n and\n newly\n accessible\n areas\n of the\n Arctic,\n USEUCOM\n sponsors\n the\n ARCTIC\n ZEPHYR\n series\n of table\n-top\n exercises\n focused\n on search\n and\n rescue\n operations\n in the\n Arctic\n.  III.\n Conclusion\ns  This\n report\n represents\n a high\n-level\n assessment\n of the\n vulnerability\n of DoD\n installations\n to five\n climate\n/weather\n impacts:\n  recurrent\n flooding,\n drought,\n desertification,\n wildfires,\n and\n thawing\n permafrost\n.  From\n a res\nources\n perspective,\n DoD\n is incorporating\n climate\n resilience\n as a cross\n-cutting\n consideration\n for\n our planning\n and\n decision\n-making\n processes,\n and\n not as a separate\n program\n or specific\n set\n of actions.\n  Some\n impacts\n are\n closely\n related\n or intensify\n the\n effect\ns of each\n other\n (e.g.,\n drought,\n desertification,\n wildfire),\n whereas\n others\n are\n somewhat\n related\n (e.g.,\n coastal\n flooding\n driven\n by changing\n sea\n level\n can impact\n river\n conveyance,\n compounding\n riverine\n flood\n levels\n for\n tidally\n-influenced\n rivers)\n.  Taken\n together,\n however,\n these\n impacts\n help\n describe\n the\n overall\n vulnerabilities\n to DoD\n installations\n from\n changing\n future\n conditions\n.  About\n two\n-thirds\n of the\n 79 installations\n addressed\n in this\n report\n are\n vulnerable\n to current\n or future\n recurrent\n flooding\n and\n more\n than\n one-half\n are\n vulnerable\n to current\n or future\n drought\n.  About\n one-half\n are\n vulnerable\n to wildfires\n.  It is important\n to note\n that\n areas\n sub\nject\n to wildfire\n may\n then\n experience\n serious\n mudslides\n or erosion\n when\n rains\n follow\n fires\n.  Impacts\n are\n dispersed\n around\n the\n country\n.  Not\n surprisingly,\n impacts\n vary\n by region\n for\n coastal\n flooding,\n with\n greater\n impacts\n to the\n East\n coast\n and\n Hawaii\n than\n the\n West\n coast\n.  Desertification\n vulnerabilities\n are\n limited\n to the\n sites\n on the\n list\n with\n arid\n soils;\n the\nse are\n in California,\n New\n Mexico,\n and\n Nevada\n.  Drought\n vulnerabilities\n are\n more\n widely\n dispersed\n across\n the\n country\n.  Wildfire\n and\n recurrent\n flooding\n impacts\n are\n the\n most\n widely\n dispersed.\n  For\n the\n most\n part,\n if an installation\n was\n currently\n vulnerable\n to a specific\n factor,\n it will\n generally\n be deemed\n vulnerable\n to that\n same\n factor\n in the\n future\n.  In a few\n instances\n, locati\nons considered\n not currently\n vulnerable\n were\n deemed\n to be vulnerable\n in the\n future\n.  Seven\n installations\n not currently\n vulnerable\n to impacts\n from\n recurrent\n flooding\n were\n estimated\n to be vulnerable\n in the\n future\n.  Five\n sites\n not currently\n vulnerable\n to drought\n were\n deemed\n vulnerable\n ', ' 17  in the\n future\n.  Seven\n sites\n not currently\n vulnerable\n to wildfires\n were\n considered\n vulnerable\n in the\n future\n. A number\n of installations\n are\n subject\n to more\n than\n one vulnerability,\n most\n notably\n recurrent\n flooding,\n drought,\n and\n wildfires.\n  It is relevant\n to point\n out that\n ﬁfutureﬂ\n in this\n analysis\n means\n only\n 20 years\n in the\n future\n.  Projected\n changes\n will\n likely\n be more\n pronounced\n at the\n mid-century\n mark;\n vulnerability\n analyses\n to mid- and\n late\n-century\n would\n likely\n reveal\n an uptick\n in vulnerabilities\n (if\n adaptation\n strategies\n are\n not implemented.)\n  The\n Department\n considers\n resilience\n in the\n installation\n planning\n and\n basing\n processes\n to include\n impacts\n on built\n and\n natural\n infrastructure\n.  This\n includes\n consideration\n of environmental\n vulnerabilities\n in installation\n master\n planning,\n management\n of natural\n resources,\n design\n and\n construction\n standards,\n utility\n systems/servi\nce,\n and\n emergency\n management\n operations.\n  Climate\n and\n environmental\n resilience\n efforts\n span\n all\n levels\n and\n lines\n of effort,\n and\n are\n not framed\n as a separate\n program\n.  Additionally,\n resources\n for\n assessing\n and\n responding\n to climate\n impacts\n are\n provided\n within\n existing\n DoD\n missions,\n funds,\n and\n capabilities\n and\n subsumed\n under\n existing\n risk\n management\n processes\n.  The\n Military\n Departments\n provide\n most\n of the\n resources\n for\n on-the\n-ground\n activities\n in the\n Geographic\n Combatant\n Commands\n.  Part\n IV.
