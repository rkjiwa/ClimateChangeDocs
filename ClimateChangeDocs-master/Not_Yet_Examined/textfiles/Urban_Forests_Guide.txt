These changes \nput more people, property and \necosystems at risk.ﬂ \n - Black et al.\n2 This guide has been prepared to help communities in British \nColumbia (B.C.) identify and prepare for some of the impacts \nof climate change. It provides information on how you can \nuse urban forests to manage some of the impacts of changing \nclimates, and how to adapt these urban forests so that they \nsurvive and thrive in future climates. \nThis is a high-level overview that can be used by staff and \nelected officials in B.C.™s communitiesŠsmall and large, rural and \nurbanŠincluding those who do not have professional arborists \nor urban foresters on staff. If you have comments or suggestions \nto improve this resource, please contact \n treesfortomorrow@gov.bc.ca\n. Global Climate Change\nThe Earth is heating up. While natural causes have played a role, \nmost of the atmospheric warming observed over the last 50 \nyears is attributed to burning of fossil fuels, land clearing, and \nother human activities that have increased the concentrations of \ngreenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This has already changed \nclimates in British Columbia and around the world, and scientists \nwarn that further climate change is unavoidable.\n11', '2Urban Forests: A Climate Adaptation Guide\n3Climate change is not just about changes in \ntemperature. The warming of the atmosphere \nleads to long-term changes in rain and snowfall \npatterns, wind and ocean currents, ice and snow \naccumulation, and other aspects of climate. It can \nincrease the frequency of droughts, heat waves, \nheavy rainfall and snowfall, and other extreme \nweather events. These changes affect fisheries, \nforests and rangelands, and the jobs that \ndepend on those resources. They increase the \nrisk of damage to infrastructure from increased \nflooding, landslides, melting permafrost, and \ncoastal storm surges, but also the risk of water \nshortages. Such impacts will increasingly \nchallenge the capacity of government, business, \nand community leaders to protect public safety, \nmanage natural resources, and promote social \nand economic sustainability.\nClimate Change Adaption\nMuch emphasis has been placed on ways to \nmitigate\n climate change by reducing use of fossil \nfuels and cutting greenhouse gas emissions. \nThis remains of great importance. However, even \nif all greenhouse gas emissions were to stop \ntomorrow, the excess greenhouse gases already \nin the atmosphere would continue to affect \nclimate for the next 30Œ40 years. In addition to \nreducing emissions, communities need to \nadapt\n to climate change impactsŠto prepare for a \ndifferent future. ‚Business as usual™ is no longer an \noption. \nAdaptation\n to climate change means making \nadjustments to minimize adverse effects and \nmaximize opportunities. It is sometimes also \ndescribed as an ongoing process that involves: \n\nAssessment to identify relevant climate \nchanges and impacts, vulnerabilities, and \npriorities for action; \n\nImplementation of these plans; and \n\nMonitoring results and updating plan(s) as \nnew information becomes available. \nUrban forests are an invaluable part of \ncommunities across British Columbia, yet they \nare often under-recognized and under-valued. \nFor this reason, the Union of British Columbia \nMunicipalities and Ministry of Community, Sport \nand Cultural Development prepared Planting \nour Future: A Tree Toolkit for Communities. \nThe toolkit helps communitiesŠsmall and \nlarge, rural and urbanŠto maximize the \nvalues from their urban forests and to address \nchallenges that they are facing. This urban \nforest adaptation guide is a companion piece to \nPlanting our Future. \nPlanting our Future \nincludes information \non the values of \nurban forests, issues \nand challenges, and \ntools and strategies to \nachieve a healthy and \nsustainable urban forest. \nIt is available from \n http://www.treesfortomorrow.gov.bc.ca/.\n', '3Introduction\n Mitigation\n refers to actions that reduce human-\ncaused greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions into \nthe atmosphere. \nAdaptation\n refers to actions that better prepare \ncommunities and businesses for climate change \nand its impacts. Adaptation actions typically \nreduce risks and increase opportunities related \nto climate change. \nSequestration\n refers to the removal of \ncarbon from the atmosphere. Trees and other \nvegetation sequester carbon as they grow, \nstoring it in their trunks, roots, branches, and \nleaves.\nThe communities that take proactive steps to \nadapt to climate change will be better prepared \nfor its impacts. The attention, time and money \ninvested will produce valuable returns in terms \nof cost savings (e.g., related to energy, fire \nsuppression or storm-clean up) and improved \neconomic performance (e.g., through enhanced \nlivability, business and staff recruitment, tourism, \nand property values). Done well, steps to adapt \nto climate change could protect human life \nand property, avoid or reduce future costs, and \nexploit new opportunities related to changes in \nﬁIntegrating climate change adaptation \ninto decision-making is an opportunity to \nenhance resilience and reduce the \n long-term costs and impacts of climate \nchange.ﬂ \n - Natural Resources Canada\n3local climateŠmaking lemonade from climate \nchange lemons! \nUrban Forests and Climate Change \nAdaptation \n While there are many benefits to be derived \nfrom urban forests (see \nPlanting our Future\n), \nthis document focuses only on those related to \nclimate change adaptation. Equally, there are \nmany ways to adapt communities to climate \nchange, but this document focuses only the \n‚tree-centric™ approaches (Figure 1). However, \nthis guide is linked to much wider thinking \nabout climate change adaptation, including \nbroader impacts on land use, infrastructure, and \nutilities planning. \nSection 2 of this guide provides an overview \nof some of the impacts of climate change on \ncommunities and urban forests, such as more \nfrequent heat waves and intense precipitation \nevents. Section 3 outlines ways that urban \nforests can help to manage these impacts, for \nexample by providing shade and detaining \nstormwater. Section 4 recognizes that urban \nforests themselves will be under stress from new \nclimatic conditions and new pests and diseases, \nand looks at ways to manage urban forests so \nthat they survive and thrive in future climates.\n ', '4Urban Forests: A Climate Adaptation Guide\n5Provincial Climate Action Initiatives \nThe Province is undertaking a variety of initiatives to mitigate and adapt to climate change. These include \nthe following. \n\nThe \nGreenhouse Gas Reduction Targets Act\n (2007) set legislated targets of provincial emissions \nreductions of 33% below 2007 levels by 2020 and 80% below 2007 levels by 2050. \n\nThe \nB.C. Climate Action Plan\n (2008) outlines strategies and initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions. \n\nMore than 179 local governments have signed the \nClimate Action Charter\n, committing to carbon \nneutrality by 2012. \n\nThe \nClimate Action Toolkit\n is a website providing information and cases studies of local government \ninitiatives towards climate action. \n\n Preparing for Climate Change: British Columbia™s Adaptation Strategy\n (2009) outlines government™s \napproach to adaptation, builds on the Province™s past accomplishments, and provides a framework for \nfuture climate change adaptation initiatives. \n\nThe B.C. \nRegional Adaptation Collaborative\n aims to advance adaptation decision-making in British \nColumbia. One of its programs is developing tools and adaptation plans for communities. \n\nThe Ministry of Forests, Mines and Lands established a Climate Change Task Team to review potential \nimpacts of climate change on provincial forest and range resources and identify knowledge gaps, \nwith recommendations provided in \nPreparing for Climate Change: Adapting to Impacts on British \nColumbia™s Forest and Range Resources\n \nThe \nFuture Forest Ecosystems Initiative\n focuses on adapting B.C.™s forest and range management \nframework so that it continues to maintain and enhance the resilience and productivity of B.C.™s \necosystems as the climate changes. \n\nThe \nZero Net Deforestation Act\n encourages an equal area of trees be planted for carbon storage \nto offset any forest land that is permanently cleared for another use. \n\nThe Community Energy and Emission Inventory is tracking land use change at the Regional \nDistrict level, including an estimate of deforestation and the resulting CO2 emissions.\nMore information and links to these provincial initiatives can be found at\n http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/cas/\nresources/reports.html\n and \nhttp://www.toolkit.bc.ca\n. ', '5Introduction\n ﬁUrban forests\nﬂ are the total collection of \ntrees and their growing environments found \nwithin our communities and their surrounding \nareas, from villages to city centres. They include \nthe treed environments on both public and \nprivately owned landsŠin parks and backyards, \nalong paths and boulevards, and other ‚green™ \nareas. They include cultivated landscapes, \nnatural areas and, in some communities, local \n‚working™ or managed forests. Although they are \nreferred to as ‚urban™ forests, this term applies \nequally to small and rural communities. \nﬁUrban forestry\nﬂ is the deliberate management \nof these treed environments to provide a wide \narray of economic, environmental and social \nservices to communities. Urban forests can \nbe a key asset in supporting more liveable, \nhealthy, sustainable and economically vibrant \ncommunities. \nFigure 1: Climate adaptation and urban forests\n', '6Urban Forests: A Climate Adaptation Guide\n7Climate Change \n and Your \nComunuity\nFuture climates and related impacts will vary from place to place, \nbut all communities in B.C. will be affected in some way. This \nguide does not provide detailed information about future climate \npredictions for specific regions in B.C., but that information is \navailable from the \nPacific Climate Impacts Consortium\n4  (PCIC). \nA good place to start is the PCIC \nPlan2Adapt\n website,  which \nincludes information on predicted impacts by regional district. \nPCIC can also provide information tailored to your community. \nProjected climate changes for British Columbia as a whole, and \nsome of the ongoing and expected impacts, are described below.\nClimate Change in B.C.\nPlaces in the northern latitudesŠsuch as British ColumbiaŠ\nare expected to experience greater warming than the global \naverage. Climate scientists expect that all parts of the province \nwill be warmer, especially in the winter, with the greatest \nincrease in northern B.C. (Figure 2). Winters will likely be wetter \nthroughout the province, with smaller snow packs and earlier \nsnowmelts. Southern and central B.C. are expected to get drier \nsummers, while the northern B.C. summers are likely to be wetter \n(Figure 3).\n6  Changes will vary by region and by altitude. \n2 From Impacts to \nAdaptation: Canada in \na Changing \n Climate 2007\n (Natural \nResources Canada, 2007) \nincludes a discussion of \nexpected climate change \nimpacts and case studies \nof responses.\n', '7Climate Change and Your Community\nFigure 2: Actual and projected temperature change, B.C. 1961-2080\nSource: Spittlehouse, 2008.

Mean annual precipitation 1961-1990, projected using the A2 emissions scenario for 2020, \n2050 and 2080\n', '9Climate Change and Your Community\nClimate and Weather \nThe weather varies from place to place, from year to year and even from decade to decade, subject to \nnatural cycles such as the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). For example, in 100 Mile House, an El Niño \nwinter can mean winter temperatures 4Œ6°C warmer with 10Œ15% less precipitation, while a La Niña winter \nmakes it 1Œ2°C cooler than average with 10Œ15% more precipitation.\n7  This is further complicated by a longer \nterm natural cycle, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which can further affect annual and seasonal temperature \nand rainfall. \nClimate is measured based on long-term averages of weather in many different places and environments. \nClimate is always changing, even without human influence, as evidenced by past ice ages. However, \nemissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere are creating significant global climate warming that is \nsuperimposed on the ‚natural™ rate of change. Moreover this anthropogenic (or humanly-modified) warming, \nand the changes associated with it, is occurring very quickly. The long-term trend of global climate warming \ncan be clearly seen, even though the weather will continue to vary from one place and time to another. \nThe climate projections shown in both figures \nare based on the assumption that global \ngreenhouse gas emissions will continue to \nincrease during the decades to come, and that \nclimate will therefore change more rapidly than \nin the past. These maps represent only one of a \nrange of possible futures for British Columbia; \nwhile scientists can tell us a lot about what is \nlikely to happen, there is still uncertainty in these \nprojections. \nOne of the challenges of adaptation is to identify \nstrategies that are robust across the full range of \npossible futures. \nChanges to Forested Ecosystems \nFuture forests will be different from those of \ntoday. The climate ‚envelopes™ suitable for many \ntree species currently found in B.C. are moving \nnorth and to higher elevations. With even a \n1°C increase in mean annual temperature, \necosystems are expected to shift up to 150 km \nnorthwards and 300 m higher. These changes \nwill have profound impacts not only on the \ntrees, but on the associated plants, animals and \necosystem processes (e.g., pollination systems) \nthat rely on B.C.™s forests. Many species of plants \nand animals will likely become endangered or \nperhaps even extinct.\nB.C.™s conifer species in particular are expected \nto lose much of their climatically suitable \nhabitat.\n8  A study of future forest ecosystems in \nB.C. predicts that in the 21st century, climatic \nsuitability for spruce and Douglas-fir forests will \n', '10\nUrban Forests: A Climate Adaptation Guide\n11\nTable 1 identifies some of the climate changes that have already occurred, and shows projections for the \nnext 40 years together with some of the related impacts. \nTable 1: Historical and projected climate change for British Columbia\nChange\n1950-2000\nBy 2050\nRelated Impacts\nMean annual \ntemperature\n+1-2°C\n+2-3°C coastal\n Up to 4°C interior\nIncreased wildlife risk\nThreats from insects continue to \nincrease\nMean spring \ntemperature\n+1.5-3°C\n+2-4°C coastal\nUp to 5°C interior\nFrost free days\n+10 per decade\n+10 per deacde\nGrowing degree days\n+5-6% per century\n+10%\nDesynchronization of flower \nemergence and pollinator \nprescence\nAnnaul Precipitation\n+10-25%\n+10% north\n +5% south\nIncreased probability of flooding\nSummer water shortages\nSpring precipitation\n10% north\n+30-40% south\n+10% north\n+5% south\nRain intensities (heavy \nprecipitation days)\n+5% / decade \nsouth\n+5-15% increase\nRiver flows\nIncreased winter / \nspring\nDecreased \nsummer / fall\nPeak 15-40 days \nearlier\nTrends to continue\nSnowpack, April 1\n20-60% decline\nContinued decline\nSummer water shortages\nIntense winter storms\nIncreased \nfrequency \n +10%\n+13% frequency\nIncreased probability of \nblowdown\nAdapted from: Black et al. 2010\nNote: these trends and projections are estimated averages for British Columbia.

Figure 4 shows \nhow the climate envelope suitable for spruce is \nexpected to change over the next 70 years, and \nFigure 5 shows the same for Douglas-fir trees. \nNatural tree migration may no longer occur fast \nenough to keep the landscape forested. Tree \nspecies can naturally migrate at about 100 m \nper yearŠbut would need to migrate several \nthousand metres per year in order to keep pace \nwith expected climate change.\nOn a more positive note, trees currently growing \nat the northern edge of their distribution, such as \nGarry oaks, arbutus or coast redwood, may thrive \nas more regions and new sites may become \nsuitable for these species. Another potentially \npositive effect of climate change (for trees) is that \nwith more carbon in the atmosphere, tree growth \nrates may increase in some areas as long as other \nsupporting factors, such as soil moisture, remain \navailable. Also, a lengthened growing season \nin higher latitudes and elevations is leading to \nincreased tree growth rates and accelerated \nmaturation processesŠboth positive for the rate \nof carbon sequestration. \nMountain pine beetles are indigenous to pine \nforests in B.C., but population numbers were kept \nin check by periods of low temperatures. Another \ncontributing factor to the mountain pine beetle \nepidemic is the abundance of hosts, like old \npine, that are stressed by changes such as longer \nperiods of drought. With warming winters and \nlonger periods of drought, beetle populations \nhave exploded and killed trees on more than \n16.3 million hectares in the province. Similar \nwarming and variable winter conditions may also \nallow the Douglas-fir beetle and spruce beetle to \nflourish. Other insects such as spruce bud worm \nand tussock moth are also expected to become \nmore prolific. The risk of outbreaks of western \nspruce budworm (which attacks Douglas-fir) \nand spruce bark beetle is projected to decrease \nin southern and central interior valleys as these \ntrees become less prevalent, and increase in \nnorth-western B.C. In addition, tree diseases \ncaused by fungi and bacteria are becoming more \nprevalent, and expected to get worse as trees \nalready stressed by changes in local climate are \nmore susceptible to pathogens.\n9  The 2006 windstorms in southern B.C. were the \nmost destructive storm event for hydro and \nphone infrastructure in the Province™s history, \nwith huge costs to industry and communities. \nExtreme events recorded by B.C.™s Provincial \nEmergency Program (PEP) from 2003Œ2005 cost \nan average of $86 million per year, compared to \n$10 million per year from 1999Œ2002.\n10\n', '12\nUrban Forests: A Climate Adaptation Guide\n13\nFigure 4: Change in climate suitable for spruce from present dayŒ2080\nFigure 5: Change in climate suitable for Douglas-fir from present dayŒ2080\n', '13\nClimate Change and Your Community\nImpacts to Communities \nExtreme Weather Events \nClimate change is bringing more frequent \nextreme weather events that can occur earlier or \nlater than ‚normal™, and last longer. This includes \nwind-, rain- and snow-storms, prolonged \ndroughts, and heat waves. Extreme weather and \nrelated impacts such as landslides create major \nchallenges for communities, including the cost of \nreplacing damaged property and infrastructure. \nFloods and Drought\nThe impacts of climate change on water will \nvary by region. In watersheds with winter snow, \nwarmer temperatures will speed up spring \nmelt, increase spring flooding, and reduce the \nflow and availability of water in summer. In \nwatersheds where precipitation falls mainly as \nrain, more intense winter rains will increase the \nrisk of downstream flooding. For many interior \nwatersheds, tree cover loss associated with \nclimate change and the mountain pine beetle \nepidemic will increase runoff and flooding. \nMore prolonged summer droughts will change \ncommunity water supplies. Climate change and \nits impacts on water flow will also affect drinking \nwater quality, municipal infrastructure, public \nsafety, aquatic and riparian habitats, hydro \ngeneration and other water-related values, and \nexacerbate conflicts between water users. \nWildfire\n In many regions of B.C., warmer temperatures \nin late spring and early fall, less summer \nprecipitation, and more frequent periods of \ndrought mean a longer fire season and increased \nrisk of a catastrophic forest fire. In parts of the \nInterior that support large areas of beetle-killed \ntrees, and in areas where past fire suppression \nhas increased fuel loads, the risk is even higher.\nSea Level Rise\n Sea levels are expected to rise along many parts \nof the B.C. coast. Depending on location, sea \nlevel on some parts of the coast is expected \nto rise by up to one metre by the end of the \ncentury (others will experience a much lower \nincrease).\n12\n  The effects of sea level rise will be \ncompounded by greater storm surges and may \ncause significant erosion to coastal shorelines. \nFigure 6: Wildfire\nThe Insurance Bureau of Canada identified the \n2003 Kelowna firestorm as the single largest \nCanadian insurance loss for a wildfire at $250 \nmillion. \n11\n', '14\nUrban Forests: A Climate Adaptation Guide\n15\nFor more information on regional implications \nfor sea level see \nProjected Sea Level Changes \nfor British Columbia in the 21st Century.\n13\nHealth Impacts \nClimate change has health implications. \nHeat waves cause a variety of mild to severe \nsymptoms linked with heat-related illnesses, \nincluding thirst, dizziness, confusion, weakness \nand fainting/collapsing.\n15\n  Smog (ground-level \nozone) also worsens during heat waves, causing \nproblems for people with heart or respiratory \nproblems. Wildfires, which are more frequent \nwith drought conditions, also create air quality \nproblems and related health advisories. \nMore intense rain and flooding can cause \nturbidity and water quality issues for drinking \nwater supplies. \nNew forest pests and diseases are able to \nmigrate and survive with the warming climate. \nCryptococcus gatti, a tropical fungus, first \nappeared in 1999 on the south east coast of \nVancouver Island, likely due to changing climatic \nconditions.

This was followed by two major \nwindstorms in January 2007. As a result of the \nstorms, approximately 10,000 trees fell (5Œ10% \nof all trees in the park) and there was severe \ndamage to about 40 hectares of the forest. \nA bibliography of treeŒwind literature is \navailable from \nwww.treelink.org\n.24\nand precipitation conditions on a site.

This section provides \ninformation on how communities can use urban forests as a tool \nfor climate change adaption. \nUrban forests can help communities to adapt to climate change \nin ways that enhance their residents™ quality of life and mitigate \nor solve anticipated problems. For example, planting large-\ncanopy trees in parking lots provides welcome shade that makes \nsummer parking more pleasant. It also reduces air pollution, as \nthe leaves absorb airborne particulates and the shade reduces \ntoxic off-gassing from hot car engines. As well, asphalt lasts \nlonger in shaded areas.

Strategically-\nplaced shade trees can dramatically reduce \nsummer heat and UV radiation.\nReduce the Heat Island Effect \nLarger communities will feel a more pronounced \n‚heat island™ effect with built-up areas that are \nhotter than nearby rural areas. (A large city \ncan be 1Œ3°C warmer than its surroundings, or \nas much as 12°C hotter in the evening.) Heat \nislands can increase summertime peak energy \ndemand, air conditioning costs, air pollution \nand greenhouse gas emissions, and heat-related \nillness and mortality.\n\nPlace groves of large-leaved trees and \nshrubs upwind of heat island areas. The \nevapo-transpiration from the vegetation \nwill create cooler, moister air that blows \ninto the ‚hot spots™. \n \nPlant and maintain green roofs and green \nwalls, which help to cool the air through \nevapo-transpiration of plants. \n Selecting the ‚Right™ Species\nThis document makes reference to tree species \nthat could be considered for specific purposes. \nHowever, the choice of the best species for the \nsite (sometimes referred to as ﬁright tree right \nplaceﬂ) will vary depending on local climatic \nconditions (current and future), site conditions \n(e.g., slope, aspect, soils, available rooting space) \nand local preferences (e.g., low-maintenance \nvariety, flowering). For more information on \nspecies selection, see page 37). \nFigure 8: Trees in a parking lot\n Evapo-transpiration is a term used to describe \nthe evaporation and plant transpiration from \nthe Earth™s land surface to the atmosphere. \nEvaporation accounts for the movement of \nwater to the air from sources such as the soil \nand canopy interception. Transpiration accounts \nfor the movement of water within a plant and \nthe subsequent loss of water as vapour through \nstomata (pores) in its leaves.\n27\n ', '19\nAdapting Communities to Future Climates\nThe \nCity of Kelowna\n planted trees to provide \nshade in the Mission Recreation Park, especially \nin parking areas. Trees were selected to be heat \nand drought tolerant, and pest resistant. The \ntrees have interpretive signs to educate the \npublic about the species chosen. \nThe \nDistrict of Saanich\n has a Significant Trees \nbylaw that protects heritage trees. If a large \nshade tree is designated as a ‚significant tree™, \nthe homeowner can apply for a grant to be \nreimbursed for up to 50% of the cost of tree \nwork that is considered beneficial to the tree. \nIncrease Shade over Pavement \nLarge shade trees can reduce local ambient \ntemperatures by 2Œ4°C. \n\nShade large areas of asphalt, such as \nparking lots. As noted above, this also \nreduces air pollution and provides a more \npleasant environment for parking. Studies \nfound that cars parked in parking lots with \n50% canopy cover emit 8% less pollution \n(from the evaporation of volatile organic \ncompounds) than cars in parking lots with \nonly 8% canopy cover.\n28\n\nShade streets and sidewalks. Trees help to \nreduce street repaving costs as shading \nhelps to increase the life span of asphalt. \nWhen asphalt paving becomes too hot, its \noil binder volatizes and leaves the stone \naggregate unprotected, so that vehicle use \nloosens the aggregate and grinds down the \npavement. One study found repaving could \nbe deferred by 10 years on a well-shaded \nstreet and perhaps 25 years on a very \nheavily-shaded street, reducing repaving \ncosts by 58% over a 30-year period. Larger \ntrees provided greater benefitsŠshade \nfrom small trees reduced costs by only \n17%.\n29\n  \n Create Comfortable Outdoor Spaces\nGreen spaces with a generous planting of trees \ncan contribute to cooler, cleaner air.\n\nPlant large shade trees in public spaces. \nWith hotter summers and concern about \nskin cancer, more people are seeking out \nshaded areas to sit or walk in. Clusters or \ngroves of trees, preferably with multiple \ncanopy layers, amplify these benefits. \n\nPlan for successive plantings that produce \na diversity of hardy species, age classes and \ngrowth rates, to ensure continuous canopy \ncover over time. \nFigure 9: Solar friendly trees for southern exposure\n', '20\nUrban Forests: A Climate Adaptation Guide\n21\nProvide Shade for Buildings \nLarge deciduous trees have particular value in \ncooling air and shading buildings in summer. \nShade trees planted on the west and south sides \nof a home can reduce cooling needs (and costs) \nby 25Œ40% and reduce peak energy demand \nby up to 30%. Reducing energy use is also \nimportant for climate mitigation. \n\nPlant trees on the west side of buildings for \nmaximum shade benefit, as this reduces \nsolar gain from the warm afternoon sun. \n\nPlant solar-friendly trees to the south-east \nor south-west of buildings, i.e., trees that \nallow heat from the low winter sun to enter \nthe building, while blocking high-angle \nsummer rays (Figure 9). Solar-friendly trees \nhave more diffuse canopies that allow light \nto penetrate while still providing shade. \nGood candidates may include some oaks, \nmost ash species, black or honey locust, \nginko, Lombardy poplar, Douglas-fir, or \nlarge pine species.\n\nLocate south-side shade trees about 3Œ7 m \nIncreased Precipitation \nMany B.C. communities will experience greater \nwinter precipitation, including more intense \nrainstorms. Flooding is expected to become \nmore frequent in some areas, with higher flood \nlevels. \nTrees and shrubs can be part of a community™s \nrainwater management system, helping to \nmanage or avoid stormwater flows in three ways. \nFirst, the tree canopy intercepts rainfall, directing \nsome of it down the trunk and into the ground, \nand returning some to the air through evapo-\ntranspiration. (The amount of interception will \ndepend on the tree species, shape, size, and leaf \narea density.) Second, the tree roots detain some \nof the rainwater in the ground (reducing peak \nfrom the building. As the tree grows taller, \nprune the lower branches to allow more \nwinter sun to reach the windows (if this \nwill not weaken the tree structure). Avoid \nplacing trees too close to the building \nfoundation to avoid damage from roots or \nproblems with branches against the roof or \nwalls. \n\nPlant deciduous trees on the east side of \nbuildings to provide morning sun for heat \nin the winter, but shade in the summer.\n\nShade air conditioning units, as this allows \nthe unit to run more efficiently. \n\nEnsure that trees are selected or placed so \nthat they do not block solar installations \n(e.g., solar panels for hot water heating). \nFort Collins\n, USA™s Forestry Division justifies \nits large annual budget of almost one million \ndollars by calculating the economic benefit \nproduced by their trees (net annual benefits \ntotal $1.17 million).

The rest recharges \ngroundwater aquifers, and less than 1% becomes \noverland runoff. As urbanization occurs and \nthere are more impervious surfaces and fewer \ntrees, much more goes to overland runoff. \nPlanting significant numbers of trees and shrubs, \nparticularly in clusters or groves, can help to \nreverse these effects. \nIncrease the Canopy Cover \nIncreasing canopy cover (leaf area) allows for \ngreatest interception of rainfall. Large mature \ntrees provide the greatest benefit, since they \nhave the most surface area to retain water.\n\nPlant and retain large-canopy trees. The \namount of rainwater a tree detains depends \nlargely on its size.

The exposed soil directly surrounding a \ntree (or root zone) has a higher infiltration rate \nthan compacted soil, because roots loosen the \nsoil and increase water penetration.

Greater rooting space allows trees to \ngrow larger, and thus provide more shade, \ninterception and other benefits. Although \nsoil cells appear to be more expensive, they \nprovide significantly more soil per unit \nvolume than structural soils so less product \nis required, reducing the relative cost.\n\nRetain large natural treed areas, which \ntypically absorb and store more water \nthan disturbed areas. The runoff from an \nundisturbed remnant forest is negligible \ncompared to open ground and even turf \nareas.

Average precipitation, \ntemperature and growing degree daysŠall \nfactors that affect tree establishment, growth \nand survivalŠwill also change. Trees will likely \nbe exposed to new pests and diseases as well \nas competition from new invasive species. As a \nresult of the climate change already experienced \nduring the last century, mature trees that were \nplanted many years ago may already be showing \nsigns of distress. For example, many cedars \nplanted as hedges in Victoria and Vancouver \nare unable to survive drier summers without \nsupplemental irrigation. Seedlings planted \ntoday not only need to grow well under present \nconditions but in climates 40Œ50 years from now. \nAdapting urban forests to climate change aims \nto reduce their vulnerability to adverse effects \nand to create treed environments that will thrive \ninto the future. This involves: \n\nReducing urban forests™ exposure to risk; \nand \n\nIncreasing urban forests™ resiliency to \ndisturbances. \nFigure 19 shows a diagram prepared as part of \nthe City of Toronto™s urban forest adaptation \nstudy, and illustrates expected climate change \nimpacts on the city™s urban forest and potential \nadaptation strategies. While it is unlikely that a \nsmall community would be able to implement all \nof these adaptation strategies, this diagram may \nhelp communities to generate ideas.\nRisk Management \nClimate change is exposing urban forests to new \nvulnerabilities and risks.

Other programs allow urban forest managers to determine where and what species to plant for \nmaximum benefits, and to model the effects of planting programs in various parts of a community. Some \nof these applications are currently only available in the U.S., but should be available in Canada in the near \nfuture. \n', '32\nUrban Forests: A Climate Adaptation Guide\n33\nFigure 18: Adaptation strategies for the urban forest in the City of Toronto\nThis diagram was produced by the Clean Air Partnership in Toronto show the inter-relationships between greenhouse gas \nemissions, climate change and related impacts, together with options for addressing these issues.\nSource: Clean Air Partnership 2007\n', '33\nAdapting Urban Forest Management to Future Climates\nwinds and heavy precipitation eventsŠwill likely \nresult in higher levels of tree death and structural \nfailure (loss of branches or the entire tree). \nGet to Know your Urban Forests \n\nYou can™t manage what you can™t measure. \nInventory and map your urban forests so \nthat you can better manage the resource \nand any risks that may threaten it. Think \ncarefully about how this information will be \nused when developing your data collection \nfields. Several web-based tools can provide \nassistance, such as the i-Tree tools described \nin \nPlanting our Future\n.  A full mapping and \nassessment of the ecological health of a \ncommunity brings many benefits including \na good understanding of the condition of \nthe urban forests. However, the investment \nof time and money may be beyond the \nmeans of smaller communities. In this case, \na simple inventory of street and park trees \nand their associated environments may be \na good place to start. Note that for many \ncommunities, much of the urban forest \nis on private land and this too should be \nconsidered. \n\nUse the information gathered in the survey \nand mapping of your urban forest to assess \nits age, species and condition. Are the age \nclasses and genera of your forest diverse \nenough? How much of your urban forest is \nover-mature or, in other words, those trees \nthat harbour diseases and insects, whose \nenvironmental/social value is diminishing \n(e.g. are rotten or are losing branches \nduring storms), and whose maintenance \ncosts are much higher than achievable? \nAlso note the site conditions within which \nyour trees are growing. Are they dry? \nSteeply sloped? Disturbed? Associated with \nwatercourses or wetlands?\nIdentify Risk Factors \n\nIdentify the climatic changes anticipated for \nyour region (see Section 2). Brainstorm with \nothers to identify what this could mean for \nyour urban forest.\n\nAssess where vulnerabilities may exist, and \nidentify the probability of these occurring \nand the likely severity of impact (see Figure \n19). \n The City of Duncan and Cowichan Tribes \ndeveloped an urban tree inventory, funded by \na Green Streets Canada grant. The survey was \nconducted by one person on a bicycle. As well as \nbeing a low-cost method and environmentally-\nfriendly, this approach provided an opportunity \nfor the surveyor to meet and talk to residents \nabout what he was doing.\n51\n  \nFigure 19: Risk evaluation matrix\n', '34\nUrban Forests: A Climate Adaptation Guide\n35\nThis will allow you to identify and prioritize \nrisks.\n  Plan for the Worst\n\nDevelop emergency response plans for \nresponding to extreme weather events that \nmay impact your urban forests. Potential \nthreats include prolonged drought, \nwindstorms, rain-or snowstorms, and for \nincreased flooding, pests, or competition \nfrom invasive species. \nThe process for developing an extreme weather \nplan could include the following:\n\nDetermine who should be involved \n(agencies, groups, government) and their \nfinancial and human resources;\n\nHire a program coordinator to work with \nthe many different groups and agencies \ninvolved;\n\nHave trained staff assess and inventory tree \ndamage;\n\n \nProvide a list of arborists for each \nmunicipality to assist in damage assessment \nand clean-up efforts;\n\n \nEstablish a toll-free number and staff to \ndeal with public inquiries;\n\nPrepare press releases and extension notes;\n\nPrepare and deliver workshops for home \nand land owners on tree care before and \nafter a major storm;\n\nAssign work crews to assist in the clean-up \nof parks, trails, roads, and waterways; and,\n\n \nProvide on-site advisory service for home \nand land owners.\n52\n\nPrepare for higher incidences of pests and \ndisease. More frost-free days, combined \nwith earlier spring weather, will increase \nthe over-wintering survivability of pests. \nWarm, moist conditions in spring and fall \nwill enhance conditions for fungi, mildew \nand bacterial diseases of trees. Also prepare \nfor threats from new invasive pests (such as \nAsian long-horned beetle, pine shoot beetle \nor emerald ash borer) and ornamental plant \nspecies such as Japanese knotweed, giant \nhogweed, and Himalayan balsam.\n53\n \n \nEstablish a process for early detection and \ntreatment of pests and disease, as this can \nminimize or delay the most severe impacts. \nManaging infestations could involve \nmassive removal of infected trees to contain \nthe spread of disease. \nThe \nCity of Victoria\n has an Integrated Pest \nManagement Policy\n55\n  that is part the City™s \nenvironmental stewardship of all public lands \nand facilities. \nThe \nCommunity Wildfire Protection Plan \n(CWPP) program assists communities in the \ndevelopment of plans that will assist them \nin improving fire prevention and protection \nmeasures in the interface areas. The CWPP will \ndefine risk areas for interface fires, identify \nmeasures necessary to mitigate those risks, \nand outline a plan of action to implement the \nmeasures.\n', '35\nAdapting Urban Forest Management to Future Climates\n\nDevelop an integrated pest management \nplan.

If the only option is to remove \nthe hazard tree, consider topping it at \n3Œ5m instead, or leave some large downed \nlogs on the ground, as these will provide \nimportant wildlife habitat. At the same \ntime, be strategic about leaving biomass \nwhich could act as forest fuels, increasing \nthe risk of forest fires. \n\nRemove sick or damaged trees to \nreduce risks from tree failure or spread \nof insects and disease. Ensure that staff \nare adequately trained and certified in \nTree Risk Assessment and Integrated Pest \nManagement. \n\nWhere there is a high risk of interface fires, \nfollow the \nFireSmart\n guidelines  to reduce \nrisk to property.  (See also page 27)\n   Communities such as\n Revelstoke\n, \nKamloops\n, Maple Ridge\n and the \nregional districts of \nNanaimo\n and \nOkanagan-Similkameen\n have \nalready completed Wildfire Protection Plans. \nThe \nNeskonlith Indian Band\n has created \na fire break around the community, and is \nplanting the fire break with pest-resistant firs to \naccelerate forest regeneration. \nDuring the windstorms of 2006Œ07, more than 10,000 trees in \nVancouver™s\n Stanley Park blew down. Trees \nthat were deemed a risk to visitors and park workers were removed. About 75% of trees and snags were \nretained, and about 80Œ120 tonnes per ha of fallen trees and stumps were left to provide wildlife habitat. \nExposed trees at the edge of the blowdown area were made wind firm through careful thinning. \nThe \nCity of Edmonton\n has prepared an urban forest management plan, which includes a direction to \naddress the risks from emerald ash borer and Dutch elm disease. Green ash and American elms make up \napproximately 46% and 32% of the City™s street trees, respectively.\n57\n ', '36\nUrban Forests: A Climate Adaptation Guide\n37\nThe \nMinistry of Forests\n, Mines and \nLands\n provides an online \nTree Species \nCompendium\n59\n  that includes information on \nnatural distribution, soil preferences, rooting \nsystems, tolerances, and much more for a variety \nof native B.C. tree species. \nEvergreen Canada \nhas a \nNative Plant \ndatabase\n60\n  (including tree species) that \nincludes information on preferred growing \nconditions. \nSpecies Selection \n Species selection is all about finding the right \ntree for the right place and time. Consider the \nspecific needs and challenges of the planting \nsite, as well as regional conditions and future \nclimate impacts. Note that this document cannot \nprovide species-specific guidance as the variety \nof ‚suitable™ species varies tremendously with \nclimate, elevation, hydrology and soils across the \nprovince. Instead, it provides some principles \nthat may help you to determine appropriate \nchoices. \n Determine the Most Appropriate Species for \nyour Location and Future Climate\n\nConsider what tree species do well on \ndrier, less nutrient-rich sites within your \narea. Some species that prefer moist \nand nutrient-rich sites may have their \ngeographic extent reduced as temperatures \nwarm, particularly in the interior of the \nprovince. \n\nLook at regions that currently have the \nclimate that your community is expecting \nby 2050. What species grow well there? \nThis can provide guidance to the trees \nthat might do well in your region in future. \nFor many parts of B.C., this means looking \nsouth or to lower elevations. \n\n \nConsider the use of non-native species, \nbut do so with considerable care. The \ndistinction between ‚native™ and ‚non-\nnative™ will become more blurred in the \nnext decades as species distributions \nshift. Whether native or introduced, one \nimportant consideration is whether the \nspecies planted is climatically adapted. This \nmay make species that are not native to \nthe area the most resilient choice. However, \nPrince George\n has a program to reduce the \nforest fuel in the interface area to reduce risk of \nwildfire damage to the city.\nFigure 20: Wildlife tree\n', '37\nAdapting Urban Forest Management to Future Climates\nbe cautious of exotic tree and ornamental \nspecies (or their pests) that can become \ninvasive in neighbouring forests. The black \nlocust tree, for example, is an invasive \nspecies\n61\n in parts of North America. A safer \nchoice may be to use species that occur \nnearby (not from a different continent) and \nare currently at their northern or upper \nelevational limit.\nConsider Current and Future Tree Stressors \nFor areas subject to greater heat:\n \nPlant heat tolerant trees in locations \nimpacted by urban heat islands (e.g., in \nparking lots or town centres). \n\nCreate clustered plantings of trees and \nshrubs that will create their own micro-\nclimate, and cool the surface and soils \nbeneath the canopy, allowing a variety of \nspecies to survive under harsher future \nclimate conditions. \n\nWhere appropriate, use porous pavers \ninstead of asphalt, as this will absorb less \nheat than black pavement.\n Plant pollution-resistant species. Hotter summers \ncan create greater concentrations of ground-\nlevel ozone, which leaves trees vulnerable to \ndeath and disease. \n For areas subject to greater drought:\n\nSelect species habituated to drier sites \nin the area or from further south. In \ngeneral, native conifers will do better than \ndeciduous species, because conifers limit \nphotosynthesis during the dry season. \n\n \nConsider water needs. Trees will be stressed \n(and survival rates reduced) in areas with \nlong drought periods. Combine smart \nspecies selection (drought tolerant) with \nbest planting practice, generous soil \nvolumes, mulching (to retain soil moisture), \nThe \nCity of Grand Forks\n has a policy to replace \nevery tree that is removed to maintain the tree \ncanopy. Trees are selected from a list of native \nand climate-appropriate species.\nIn \nToronto\n and \nChicago\n, neighbourhood watering programs use volunteers to water trees in parks and \nneighbourhoods during drought periods.\n62\n Village Tree Way in the \nVillage of Pemberton\n has been planted with trees that need little watering, \nreducing maintenance costs. They also selected non-fruit bearing species that would not attract bears. \nSan Francisco\n allows residents to convert a portion of the sidewalk into a landscaped area. Trees and plants \nwith low water needs are encouraged. \n', '38\nUrban Forests: A Climate Adaptation Guide\n39\ngood site design (to allow harvesting of \nlocal rainwater interflows) and water-smart \nirrigation systems. Irrigation is most critical \nin first three years of establishment. At the \nsame time, take care not to water native \ntrees beyond this stage as it could reduce \nroot depth penetration and make them \nmore susceptible to blow down.\n\nIn areas with a cheap and plentiful water \nsupply (e.g., groundwater), consider \nincreasing summer watering programs. \nCommunity volunteers could be recruited \nto help. Be careful not to overwater species \nthat grow deep taproots. Under conditions \nof over-watering, these species do not \nbecome wind firm and may be susceptible \nto blowing down.\nFor areas subject to more intense rain or flooding \nevents: \n\nChoose trees that can tolerate waterlogged \nsoils for short periods of time. Select species \nthat tend to dominate in seasonally wet \nsites. Examples of water-tolerant species \ninclude cottonwood, swamp cypress, many \nwillows, red maple, and alder. \nFor areas subject to high winds:\n\nChoose wind-firm, drought-tolerant species \n(as wind desiccates plants). Select species \nwith attributes such as sound branch \nattachments, high wood strength and a \nwell-distributed root system. Allow for deep \ngrowing soils.\n\n \nRetain open-grown trees that are adapted \nto winter storm winds in areas of risk. \nClose-growing trees, once thinned, may \nbe susceptible to blowing down as they \nwill not have formed broad, secure rooting \nsystems.\n\n \nConsider planting in larger groups where \npossibleŠtrees are more wind firm as a \ngroup than isolated as individuals. \n\n \nAvoid planting on ridge tops or leaving \nnarrow remnant strips of natural forests on \nexposed ground.\nPlanting and Maintenance \nProper planting and maintenance will give \nyoung trees the best chance of surviving \nand thriving. Guidelines for planting and \nmaintenance are included in \nPlanting our \nFuture\n. From a climate adaptation perspective, \nthe aim is to minimize stress on trees, so that \nthey can respond better to the challenges \nassociated with climate change. Key practices \ninclude the following.\nChoose the Right Tree for the Right Place and \nRight Time\n\nSelect species for the given site conditions \nand future climates, as described above. \n\n \nChoose healthy stock with well developed \nroot systems. Avoid root-bound container \ngrown stock.\n\nEnsure the planting site provides adequate \nspace for tree root growth. In urban \nsettings, use structural soils (see page 22). \n  ', '39\nAdapting Urban Forest Management to Future Climates\nUse Best Planting Practices \n\nPlant in loam soils that are loose (not \ncompacted) and deep enough to support \nhealthy root development (at least 60Œ75 \ncm).\n\nStake the tree low enough on its stem to \nensure that the roots don™t move, while the \nupper portion of the tree can sway.\n\n \nAvoid adding organic amendments to the \nsoil (<5% by weight or 20% by volume); \ninstead top dress with about 10 cm of \norganic mulch. Do not mulch above root \nball; mulch beyond this point instead, so as \nnot to encourage fine root development up \ninto the mulch layer. Irrigate deeply twoŒ\nthree times per week during dry season \n(more if in a windy area).\n\n \nAvoid soil compaction, as this can \nconsiderably shorten the life of the tree. \n\n \nHire or train staff to become ISA Certified \nArborists who are competent in all aspects \nof tree care.\n Use Best Maintenance Practices \n\nPrune young trees to develop a sound \n‚architecture™ that can withstand snowfall, \nwindstorms, etc. For tree pruning \ninformation see the \nInternational Society \nfor Arboriculture\n website.\n63\n  \n\nAvoid unintended consequencesŠsuch as \ndamage to bark from mowing machines or \nweed-whackers, or damage to roots from \nbuilding activities or utility maintenance. \nCreate turf-free areas around the base of \ntrees; invest in education and training of \nturf-maintenance staff; and place plastic \ntree guards around the base of young \nboulevard trees.\n\nFor a variety of best management \npractices see the \nCompendium of Best \nManagement Practices for Canadian \nUrban Forests\n.64\nMonitor Urban Forest Conditions\n\nRoutinely monitor trees for new pests \nand diseases. This can help to avoid or \nminimize problem insects. It can also avert \na potentially catastrophic infestation from a \nforeign pest taking hold, such as the Asian \nlong-horned beetle or European ash borer. \nHelpful resources in good planting and early \ntree care practice are found at the ISA website\nFigure 21: Site preparation, Ucwalmicw Centre Society\n', '40\nUrban Forests: A Climate Adaptation Guide\n41\nCommunity volunteers can be trained to \nhelp monitor trees in their neighbourhood. \n\n \nMonitor and report on tree conditions. This \nis important as it provides feedback on how \ntrees are responding to climatic changes, \nand which species are proving the best-\nadapted. With the right training, volunteers \ncan be asked to help with tree monitoring. \n Diversity and Resilience\nConservation of biodiversity in the landscape is \na key strategy for coping with climate change. \nThe term ‚ecosystem resilience™ refers to an \necosystem™s ability to adjust to and recover \nfrom changing circumstances such as climate \nchange. The more complex and sizeable the \nnatural areas that remain, the more likely species \nwithin a landscape will be able to adapt to \nchange successfully. The more fragmented and \nsimplified a landscape is, the less likely that \nsuccessful adaptation will occur. \nMany urban landscapes are quite simplifiedŠ\nsuch as a row of cherry trees along a downtown \nstreet. This makes them vulnerable to a single \npest disease (e.g., bacterial canker) that could \nwipe out all of the trees. A more complex \necosystem with a variety of tree species and age \nclasses will likely survive that pest infestationŠ\neven if the cherry trees are affected. Resilience \ncan be improved by conserving natural areas, \nincreasing species diversity, providing ecosystem \nconnectivity, careful species selection, and good \nplanting/maintenance practices.\nAn \nInternational Tree Failure Database\n (ITFD) \nis a searchable database with information on \ntree failure from countries throughout the \nworld. This information is gathered to help \ntree managers and researchers worldwide in \nuncovering tree failure patterns, allowing for \nbetter prediction of tree failures, the creation of \nappropriate standards for species selection and \nmaintenance, and reduced impacts from tree \nfailures.\n65\n Ecosystem Resilience at a Landscape \nScale\nUrban forests are not isolated entities, but \nexist within a much larger regional landscape \n(ecosystem), sometimes intimately connected \nto the surrounding forests, woodlands and \ngrasslands. It is helpful to think on a range \nof scales when developing strategies for \nadaptation. \n  Agencies such as the Ministry of Forests, Mines \nand Lands are actively working to develop \nclimate change adaptation strategies at larger \n(bioregional) scales. Recognizing the role of \nurban forests within the larger regional context, \nand working with other players in this field of \nresearch, can amplify efforts being made at a \nmore local scale and provide greater access to \nresources and expertise\n', '41\nAdapting Urban Forest Management to Future Climates\nIncrease the Biodiversity of Urban Forests \n\nPlant a diversity of tree and shrub species. \nThis avoids monocultures that make it easy \nfor pests and disease to spread, and raises \nthe odds that at least some of the tree \nspecies will thrive in future climates and \nbe resistant to new pests and diseases. The \nMunicipal Specialist Certification Guide \nrecommends the ﬁ10/20/30 ruleﬂ: no more \nthan 10% of one species or cultivar, 20% of \none genus, or 30% of one family.\n66\n \nEnsure that there is a healthy distribution \nof age classes and growth rates within your \ntree population. Many communities with \nstreet trees have even-aged trees that are \nreaching the end of their safe and useful life. \n\nProtect critical habitat and ecosystem \ncomponents, particularly around streams \nand wetlands. Ensure that riparian setbacks \nare adequate to ensure that large trees and \ntheir associated vegetation can be retained \nwell into the future.\n\nCreate greenspace connections between \ntreed and other natural ecosystems. This will \nhelp to support local biodiversity. \nThe \nCity of Prince George\n has been \nexperimenting with different species of trees \nin city parks, including cultivars, in case native \ntrees do not survive changing climates. \nThe \nDistrict of Invermere\n is planting a diversity \nof deciduous and coniferous trees to create a \nﬁresistant urban forestﬂ. \nThe \nDistrict of Sparwood \nhas removed beetle-\nkilled trees to reduce fire risk in residential \ninterface areas.
