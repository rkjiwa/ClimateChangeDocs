Preparing for these changes and the impacts they will \nhave on natural systems and human communities is usually called ﬁclimate change \nadaptation,ﬂ and is the subject of this guide. Understandably, much attention has been \nfocused to date on ﬁclimate change mitigation,ﬂ or efforts to reduce greenhouse gas \n(GHG) emissions in the atmosphere and help slow the rate of climate change.\n1 How\n-ever, no matter how successful we are at reducing GHG emissions, we still face climate \nchange impacts linked to past and ongoing GHG emissions that will be present in the \n\natmosphere for many years to come. This means that both types of climate action are \nnecessary: mitigation to avoid even more dangerous impacts, and adaptation to deal \nwith the inevitable level of change that scientists advise we will continue to face for the \nnext century or longer.\nPreparing for Climate Change: An Implementation Guide for Local Governments in BC\n is designed to assist local government elected officials and staff, including planners, en\n-gineers, chief administrative officers, financial officers and others, to plan and act in ways \nthat will make their communities more resilient to the impacts of climate change.\nThe effects of a changing climate vary and will continue to vary significantly from region \nto region in BC, from sea level rise and flooding in some areas to drought and increased \nrisk of wildfire and invasive species in others. Local governments can access information \nabout regional climate change impacts in BC through Plan2Adapt \nhttp://pacificclimate.\norg/tools-and-data/plan2adapt\n, the website specially developed for BC communities by \nthe Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium based at the University of Victoria. As well, a num\n-ber of publications and approaches have been developed to assist local governments in \n\nunderstanding the risks they face, how vulnerable they are, and how to set priorities for \naction. This guide also provides a very brief overview of processes for assessing risk and \nvulnerability to climate change impacts and prioritizing actions, but it is expected that \nlocal governments will rely on other resources to guide them in these areas. Appendix A \noffers information on further resources on all of these topics.\nThis resource identifies the tools that local governments can use to implement climate \nchange adaptation strategies. Preparing for and responding to climate change impacts \n\nwill, \nin most communities, engage a wide range of existing local government services \n1 Resources to help local governments reduce their GHG emissions can be found in the BC Climate \nAction Toolkit \nwww.toolkit.bc.ca\n.', '7and responsibilities, such as, for example, land use planning, transportation systems, infra\n-structure, emergency response planning and delivery, community services, corporate servi\n-ces and management, financial planning and asset management.\nWherever possible, this guide provides concrete examples, drawing on the growing experi\n-ence of local governments in BC, and also some examples from outside the province. Many \nof the strategies that can help to address a changing climate are also good practices that \nwill benefit communities regardless of the climate change impacts they face. These benefits \nmay assist local governments in developing a ﬁbusiness caseﬂ for climate change adaptation \naction. For example, using green infrastructure solutions like topsoil requirements, rain gar\n-dens, bioswales and other measures can provide greater resilience with respect to increased \n\nprecipitation. At the same time, in some instances they can also save local governments \nmoney as a result of the reduced life cycle costs associated with these measures compared to \ntraditional pipe and drain infrastructure. \nThere is no one way to prepare for climate change, however there are emerging practices \nthat can be followed or modified to fit local circumstances. It is hoped that this guide will help \nlocal governments better understand the scope and nature of the challenge that a changing \n\nclimate presents, and how they can use existing tools and resources to implement climate \nchange adaptation strategies.\nWherever possible, \nthis guide provides \n\nconcrete examples, \n\ndrawing on the \n\ngrowing experience \n\nof local governments \n\nin BC, and also some \nexamples from \n\noutside the province. \n', '88Understanding climate change adaptationSETTING THE CONTEXT: \nA CHANGING CLIMATE IN BCClimate is usually defined as the ﬁaverage weatherﬂ in a given location, over a period of \ntime ranging from months up to thousands of years. Temperature, precipitation, humidity, \ncloudiness, air pressure and wind are some of the aspects of climate that are measured.\nﬁClimate changeﬂ refers to a change in the mean state of the climate, or in climate variabil\n-ity, that persists for decades or longer. Thus climate change can mean general warming in \n\nmean annual air temperature, or warmer winters, but also changes in the frequency and \n\nintensity of extreme weather events, including heat waves, heavy rain and snow storms, \nand drought. The global climate has changed over long periods of time as a result of \nnatural causes. However, more recent and rapid climate change is being attributed to \n\nhuman activities, such as burning fossil fuels and land use changes.\n2Historical measurements indicate that British Columbia™s climate has changed over the \n\npast century: average annual temperature increased by 0.6\noC on the coast, 1.1\noC in the interior and 1.7\noC in northern BC. Much of the warming was likely due to an increase in \nnighttime minimum temperatures.\n3Lakes and rivers now become free of ice earlier in the spring, on average, and two large \n\nBC glaciers have each retreated by more than a kilometre. The Fraser River discharges a \nlarger share of its total annual flow sooner in the year, and has warmer water in summer. \nSince the beginning of the 1900™s, average sea levels have risen by 4 to 12 centimeters \n\nalong most of the coast, with maximum levels up 16 to 34 cm in the Vancouver area. \n\nAverage coastal sea surface temperatures are 0.9\noC to 1.8\noC higher.\n4Climate change science suggests that by mid-century (2050s), mean annual temperatures \n\nacross BC will be 1.4°C to 3.7°C warmer, on average. Extremely warm temperatures will \n\nbecome more frequent. A warmer climate will result in more growing degree days and \nfrost free days\n Š increasing the potential for plant growth.

In \nsummer, northern BC maybe up to 15% wetter, while southern BC may be up to 20% \ndrier. In winter and spring, snowfall will decrease.\n5While these changes may seem small, they will have significant impacts on natural \n\nsystems. Water resources and the hydrologic cycle, for example, are highly sensitive \n\nto year-to-year climate variability as well as long term changes in \nclimate. Changes in air temperature and precipitation patterns \nare already having noticeable effects on weather, water cycles and \n\necology, which in turn have impacts on forests, fisheries, agriculture, \n\nrecreational opportunities and other resource-based sectors.\nMany of the most costly impacts of climate change are associated \nwith increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. \nHeavy ﬁpineapple expressﬂ rainfall events have caused widespread \nurban flooding in the Lower Mainland in recent years, and may have \n\nheightened the risk of slides on steep slopes in some communities.\n6 However, gradual changes will also have significant impacts over \ntime. Some examples are set out below:\nThe mountain pine beetle infestation, linked to milder \nwinters and decades of forest fire suppression, has \n\nsignificantly affected ecosystems, communities, and the \n\neconomy;\nSea level rise associated with warming, combined with \n\nhigher storm surges, increases the likelihood of flooding and \nerosion in low lying coastal communities;\nThe 2003 and 2009 wildfire seasons were the most \n\ndangerous and expensive on record; as summers continue \nto warm and become drier, such seasons will likely become \n\nmore frequent;\nSmaller snow packs and shrinking glaciers contribute to \n\nlower summer stream flows and increased probability of \nsummer water shortages in some regions; and\nThe seasonal droughts of 2003 and 2009 demonstrate the \n\nvulnerability of water supplies. BC can expect droughts like \nthis to become more frequent.\n5 Zwiers, F.W., Schnorlous, M.A., & Maruszoczka, G.D.

By contrast, human \n\nsystems, including local governments, can use increasingly reliable information from \n\nclimate scientists about future climate and its impacts to be pro-active, anticipate and \n\nprepare ahead. Local governments can consider the costs and benefits of taking action \nin advance compared with making adjustments after the climate changes.\nClimate change adaptation and local governmentsThe provincial government has a climate change adaptation strategy\n8 that recognizes \nlocal governments as important decisionmakers with respect to climate adaptation. BC \n\nlocal governments have powers and responsibilities related to land use, public infrastruc\n-ture and finances, and a range of services, from emergency management to economic, \ncultural and social programs that can be used to develop and implement an integrated \n\napproach to local climate change adaptation.\nFor local governments, putting adaptation to climate change into practice will mean \nenhancing the resilience of the built and natural environments within their jurisdic\n-tions, managing risk, making sound capital investments, managing infrastructure costs, \n7 Core Writing Team, Pachauri, R.K. and Reisinger, A.

While the tools used by local government will be familiar ones, there are some \n\nimportant new considerations:\nThe time horizon for adaptation planning will in many cases be much longer than the \n\ntypical five-year cycles of official community plans or financial plans;\nThe past will no longer be a reliable indicator of the future, particularly with respect to \nnatural hazards and conditions and the demands they place on infrastructure. While \nthere is uncertainty about future climate change impacts, scientific information about \n\ntrends is available and in most cases enough to begin preparing; and\nCommunity consultation and engagement in solutions will be more important than \n\never, particularly because of the potential trade-offs that will be required.\nThe goal of adaptation is to reduce vulnerability and risk associated with climate change. Some \n\npossible examples include:\nAdapting to more extreme precipitation by increasing the area of permeable surface \n\nto slow run-off and decrease erosion;\nAdapting to sea level rise by buffering shorelines or considering alternative strategies;\nAdapting to increased wildfire risks by developing a fuel treatment program and \n\nmaking changes to zoning and development permitting; and\nAdapting to more frequent water shortages by improving water conservation and \n\nplanting drought-tolerant species.\nAdaptation may also include actions that realize any opportunities presented by climate \n\nchange Š for example, longer growing seasons may present enhanced opportunities for local \nmarket gardening.\nPLANNING\n FOR ˜CLIMATE\n˚ \nCHANGELocal governments \nalready plan for \n\nmedium- and \nlong term \n\nchange Š whether \nit is population \n\ngrowth, shifting \n\ndemographics, \n\nnew economic \n\ndrivers or changing \n\nsocial needs\n Š and \nclimate change is \n\njust another factor \n\nof change that \n\nwill need to be \n\naccounted for.\nPHOTO\n COURTES\nY \nCIBOULETTE\n/FLICKR', '12Climate change adaptation and climate change mitigationClimate change adaptation and climate change mitigation (reducing greenhouse gas emissions) are \nrelated, and both are important for local government. However, they serve different ends: climate \n\nchange adaptation is about dealing with the problems created by climate change, and climate \n\nchange mitigation is about not making the problem worse.\nWhile adaptation and greenhouse gas reduction decisions often occur within the same con\n-texts\n Š land use, infrastructure, park, water use, and other planning processes\n Š there may or may \nnot be obvious practical linkages.\nFor example, addressing increased flooding risks by raising dikes or changes to zoning and require\n-ments for development permits does not directly affect the greenhouse gas emissions produced by \na community. On the other hand, planting urban trees helps communities cope with more frequent \nheat waves and increased stormwater run-off, while at the same time removing carbon from the \natmosphere as the trees grow\n Š a case where climate change mitigation and adaptation overlap.\nGenerally speaking, this guide favours approaches to adaptation that increase overall community \n\nresiliency, and have multiple benefits, however the first priority for adaptation actions should be \n\nto effectively address the climate change impacts that the community has identified as needing \nattention. It would be ideal if all the adaptation actions local governments choose to implement \nalso reduced greenhouse gas emissions, for example, or had other important co-benefits. However, \n\nmany adaptation actions will likely be neutral with respect to greenhouse gas emissions. The dia\n-\ngram below outlines how some adaptation and mitigation policies overlap, and some do not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMitigation \nReduces Emissions\nAdaptation \nReduces Harm \nFigure 2:   Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Options \nThe potential for ﬁwin-winﬂ solutions did not, however, drive the selection of the short-term \nadaptation actions that were included in Toronto™s adaptation strategy. It is possible that they \nmay be more important in developing the longer-term strategy.  Certainly TEO recommended \nthat in budget proposals for climate change activiti\nes in 2009 City Divisions should consider the \ncontribution that the proposed actions would make to emissions reduction \nand to reducing \nimpacts.It remains to be seen the extent to which mitigation and adaptation can be planned together. \nThere is no question that these strategies should complement each other wherever possible. It \nis important that mitigation actions do not increase the impacts of near-term climate change, \n\nand that adaptation actions avoid contributing to greater emissions.  However, mitigation and \n\nadaptation cannot be completely integrated. Take for example, actions that may reduce flooding \n\nfrom more intense storms.  Some actions such as increasing naturalized areas, green roofs, \nand permeable pavements are likely to decrease flooding and, because of their contribution to \ncooling the local environment, reduce the use of energy for air conditioning and associated \n\nemissions.  However, reducing the impacts of flooding may also require dykes, stormwater \n\nponds, enlargement of culverts and other actions that do little or nothing to contribute to \n\nemissions reduction.  This does not make them less necessary.  \nThere was some early discussion among City of Toronto Adaptation Core Group members \nabout trying to put together a strategy that in\ntegrated climate change adaptation and overall city \nsustainability. This approach is expressed conceptually in Figure 3.  \n40Source: \n J. Penney 2008. \nClimate Change Adaptation in the City of Toronto: Lessons for the Great Lakes \nCommunities\n.

What is at stake is \n\nhow successful local governments will be at minimizing the potential negative impacts of climate \n\nchange on their communities, and realizing any opportunities that may arise.\nTo make the best use of scarce resources, local governments can plan ahead and use a strategic \napproach to climate change adaptation. Of course, after weighing options, a local government \n\nmay still decide to take no action with respect to a future climate impact, but \n\nthere is an important distinction between deciding not to act, and not acting \nbecause of inertia or failing to consider alternatives.\n9A strategic, or planned approach to climate change adaptation has a number \n\nof key benefits for local governments:\nGreater opportunities for adopting measures that have co-benefits \nand align with other community goals can be explored; \nTime can be taken to evaluate and address potential insurance and \n\nliability issues arising from climate change impacts;\nCost savings can be realized by considering climate change impacts in the regular \n\nmaintenance/updating/renewal schedule of existing infrastructure and by planning for \n\nnew infrastructure to avoid expensive upgrades later; \nAdaptation measures that have unintended adverse impacts are more likely to be \n\navoided if they have been identified and evaluated in advance;\nEmergency needs can be identified and prioritized in advance of crises;\nOpportunities for cooperation with other governments and agencies can be explored;\nCommunities can be consulted and engaged in developing and implementing \n\nresponses;\nSteps can be taken to enhance the resilience of vulnerable ecosystems before \nenvironmental thresholds are reached; and\nLocal governments can avoid committing to development patterns or development in \n\nareas that will pose significant risks for inhabitants over the longer term as a result of \nclimate change impacts.\nThe table on the following pages is based on materials from Canada™s National Assessment for \n\nBritish Columbia and a format prepared for King County, Washington.

Climate change and \n\nits impacts vary from one location to another, and communities vary in their exposure \n\nand ability to cope. In order to develop a climate change adaptation strategy, a local gov\n-ernment will need to learn about the potential regional impacts facing its community, \nidentify ways in which the community is vulnerable, and quantify risk related to climate \nchange. \nAppendix A\n identifies resources that can help local governments carry out or \nparticipate in assessments of vulnerability and risk.\nGood information about climate change is the foundation for this stage in the adaptation \nprocess.\nAdditional scientific information, in particular on the regional impacts of climate change, \nexists in various forms, mostly technical reports and analyses. The amount available in \nplain language, however, is currently limited, but growing. Appendix A includes a few \n\nkey sources of such information, including the comprehensive high level summary of \n\nthe scientific literature on climate change impacts in BC produced by Natural Resources \nCanada.\n1010 D.S.

PCIC also aims to ﬁbridge the gapﬂ between climate science experts \n\nand decisionmakers, by supporting the two-way transfer of knowledge, and by making \nscientific information more accessible.\nSome communities in BC have engaged PCIC to produce \ninformation specific to their communities, while others have \n\nrelied on ﬁoff the shelfﬂ information about regional climate change \n\navailable from the Plan2Adapt website. The website provides \n\naccess to climate data tables, user-friendly graphs and maps of \n\nfuture temperature, precipitation, snowfall, and other climate \n\nvariables, and written summaries of this information. For example, \n\nPlan2Adapt indicates that mean annual temperature in the Peace \n\nRiver Regional District will be 1.4°C to 2.8°C warmer in the 2050s. \n\nUsers can download contents for further analysis, reporting, \n\nand for use in presentations. See \nhttp://pacificclimate.org/\n\ntools-and-data/plan2adapt\n.Plan2Adapt \ninteractive \n\nplanning tool \n\nwebsite\n18', '19Local observations and expertise are also an important source of information about climate change \nimpacts and vulnerabilities. Making a connection between local knowledge and higher-level scien\n-tific information will both enhance understanding of the impacts of a changing climate and help to \nengage the community in considering adaptation strategies.\n11Uncertainty about the rate of climate change, and severity of impactsThere are two main sources of uncertainty in scientific climate projections. First, climate change is \n\nlinked to the concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and future levels depend on \nhow successful the global community is at reducing greenhouse gas emissions in coming years. \nSecond, scientists obtain information about future climate change from computer models of the \n\nglobal climate system, and these models, though sophisticated, may not fully reflect the intricacies \n\nof the climate system.\nDespite the uncertainty in projections of future climate, most experts agree there is enough informa\n-tion for decisionmakers to start to prepare. The uncertainty is not whether the climate is changing, \n\nbut how rapidly. It is important to view adaptation as a process; as new information becomes avail\n-able or certain physical changes become apparent, actions can be re-evaluated and updated.\nSome of the resources in Appendix A discuss uncertainty and provide guidance on how local gov\n-ernments can address it in their assessment and planning processes. Section 4 of this guide also \nprovides an introduction to ways that local governments can build adaptive capacity and resilience \n\nin their communities so that they can better cope with uncertainty. Part 2 looks at ways to implement \n\nclimate change adaptation strategies, and integrate climate change adaptation into local govern\n-ment planning and decision-making. It also considers how certain approaches, for example, green \n11 See, for example, Ingrid Liepa (2009) \nAdapting to Climate Change in Kimberley, BC, Executive Summary\n.  www.city.kimberley.bc.ca/sites/kimberley.civicwebcms.com/files/media/iWeb/%7B0647EEC8-854E-424A-\nA28A-026746766D52%7DExecutiveSummary-June30.pdf\nDespite the \nuncertainty in \nprojections of \n\nfuture climate, \n\nmost experts agree \n\nthere is enough \ninformation for \ndecisionmakers to \n\nstart to prepare.\nPHOTO\n COURTES\nY \nECSTATICIST\n/FLICKR', 'PREPARING FOR CLIMATE CHANGE: \nAn Implementation Guide for Local Governments in British Columbia \ninfrastructure measures (relying on natural and engineered features to more closely \nmimic the natural hydrologic cycle), offer greater flexibility in the face of uncertainty \naround future climate change projections as opposed to making changes to conven\n-\ntional pipe and drain infrastructure.\nIdentifying and evaluating adaptation optionsAfter assessing risk and vulnerability, the next stage is to identify and evaluate com\n-\nmunity adaptation options, strategies, and actions. It should be emphasized that the \nscientific information about climate change in a region or local area will not in itself \ndetermine the action that needs to be taken. As with any matter within their jurisdiction, \n\nlocal governments will still need to consider the relevant information and make policy \n\nchoices about the actions that are most appropriate for their communities.\nThis guide provides many practical ideas about how communities can increase their \nresilience and manage risk related to climate change, and ways to deliver adaptation \nstrategies. Local government case studies, sector-specific guides, and other resources \nidentified in Appendix A are other good sources of adaptation ideas. Many commun\n-\nities, once they understand their vulnerabilities, can identify adaptation options and \n\npriorities through consultation and discussion in their communities.\nNot all adaptation options are equally cost-effective or appealing. Vision, values, risk \ntolerance, priorities, resources, and other factors vary from one community to another, \nso even those facing similar risks and opportunities may make different adaptation \nchoices. Actions that address current issues at the same time as potential future climate \n\nchange impacts are particularly effective. In some cases, science can help to inform deci\n-\nsions about which adaptation options to select; for example an engineering study might \nprovide solid information about the cost and effectiveness of several different engin\n-eered solutions to urban flooding. In other cases, for example where there are difficult \n\ntrade-offs to be made, significant community engagement and consultation may be \n\nrequired. Robust adaption strategies typically include a range of adaptation measures \nor actions to be implemented.\nPRIORITIZING ACTIONS\n IN KIMBERLEY, BC\nIn 2008Œ2009 the City \nof Kimberley was a \npilot community in the \nColumbia Basin Trust™s \n\nCommunities Adapting to \n\nClimate Change Initiative\n.

This is sometimes called ﬁmainstreamingﬂ and is ad\n-dressed further in Section 4. Alternatively, some communities choose to first develop stand-alone \nﬁadaptation plans.ﬂ In this case further steps are necessary to integrate the actions identified in the \n\nadaptation plans into planning documents and decision-making processes. \nIn terms of monitoring results, there is no standard measure of adaptation success. In general, the \ngoals of adaptation are to increase community resilience, reduce risk, and advance opportunities. \nMany adaptation actions will also advance broader sustainability goals. In practice, the results of \nadaptation will look different for every community, based on how local impacts are addressed. \nOver time, climate change adaptation strategies and actions will need to be regularly updated and \nrefined to take into account both new information and evolving realities about climate change im\n-\npacts. They will also need to reflect other factors that may be relevant in a given community, such as \n\nincreasing or decreasing populations and shifting demographics, changing economic drivers, new \ntechnologies, opportunities for cooperation or funding, and others. Adaptation is a process. Local \ngovernments and their communities will need to continue to be engaged with assessing climate \n\nchange impacts, prioritizing actions and implementing responses, as long as the climate continues \n\nto change.\nAdaptation is a \nprocess.

As one commentator has observed, \n\nthe question to ask is not ﬁWhat are all the changes that will happen and how can we \n\nrespond?ﬂ but ﬁWhat do we do, and how should we adjust that for the reality of climate \n\nchange.ﬂ The idea is to integrate climate change adaptation into existing activities.\n13Once they have assessed risk and vulnerability to impacts, it may be useful for local govern\n-\nments to undertake a ﬁcapacity assessment.ﬂ This can look at adaptive capacity both from a \n\nbroader community perspective, as well as with respect to the main institutional bodies in \n\na community, including local government. An example is the Atlin Adaptive Capacity As\n-sessment.\n14 In looking at ways to strengthen adaptive capacity, communities might want \nto consider how they responded to events in the past that were similar to those expected \n\nin the future, such as natural hazards like flooding or wildfire. It is important to build on \nexisting strengths and programs within the community.\nThree related approaches that can help strengthen adaptive capacity across local gov\n-ernment are discussed below: ﬁmainstreamingﬂ climate change adaptation into local \ngovernment planning and decision-making; adaptive management, a way to incorporate \n\ninnovation and responsiveness into planning and decision-making; and cooperating and \n\ncollaborating.\nMainstreamingﬁMainstreamingﬂ adaptation means ensuring that planning and decision-making take \n\nclimate change impacts and vulnerability assessment into account wherever relevant. It \nputs in place an integrated response to a changing climate, assists in ensuring that op\n-portunities to address vulnerabilities are explored, and also helps to avoid policies and \nprojects that have an adverse effect on adaptation because climate change impacts were \n\nnot considered.

It is based on the notion that policies \n\nare developed with inherent uncertainties and that the wider social, cultural, economic and ecological \n\nenvironment inevitably changes over time. Change can originate from external factors such as climate \n\nchange or global economic crisis, or from factors particular to Victoria, such as changes to the city™s \n\nsocio-economic conditions, community values or a localized natural disaster. Changes of this kind may \n\nundermine the goals, broad objectives and policies of this plan and impede progress towards their \n\nachievement.

They may also grapple with \nissues related to jurisdiction, where some of the information needed to assess impacts or \nlevers needed to implement responses lie with other governments or agencies.\nOne way to enhance the capacity of local governments to assess impacts is to work collabora\n-tively, with other local governments, provincial and federal governments, government agen\n-\ncies, First Nations, the academic community and professional associations, many of which are \n\nalready working to understand how the climate is changing and what the impacts will be.

Of course, it is also true that local governments have a lot to \nconsider in order to ensure that their communities are prepared for climate change. \n\nThe good news is that a number of BC local governments have already begun to take \n\naction to address the impacts of a changing climate, and local governments that are \n\njust getting started have a growing number of examples to consult. The information \nthat is provided in this part of the guide is complemented by references to many of \nthese examples.\nPart 2 first examines the higher-level community plans under the \nLocal Government \nAct\n that local governments can use to implement climate change adaptation strat\n-egies. Regional growth strategies and official community plans can provide a sup\n-portive framework for the development and implementation of integrated climate \nchange adaptation strategies. The policy guidance offered by these documents can \nhelp direct action with respect to land use planning and other areas of local govern\n-\nment jurisdiction such as infrastructure, emergency management planning, asset \n\nmanagement and financial planning, the protection of biodiversity, and community \nand economic development services.\nAlso important for developing an integrated response to a changing climate are \nthe tools that can be used to implement land use planning, such as development \n\npermits, zoning, and various other measures as outlined below. Some local govern\n-\nments may be tempted to carry on with \nstatus quo land use plans for their com\n-\nmunities. However, the decisions made today about land use will have long term \nconsequences, enduring until later this century when some of the more significant \nimpacts of a changing climate will have become a reality.\nLocal governments need to start planning now for a climate that is outside the range \nof what has been ﬁnormalﬂ for the past century or longer here in BC. As well, plan\n-\nning for the ﬁnew normalﬂ in an integrated way will mean more opportunities to be \nproactive, create additional community benefits and save costs down the road. And \nwhile liability related to climate change impacts is still a very new area of the law, \n\nit would be wise for local governments to act prudently in light of projected im\n-\npacts. For these reasons it is important to begin thinking about how climate change \n\npreparedness can be integrated into land use planning policies and regulations. A \n', '27PREPARING FOR CLIMATE CHANGE: \nAn Implementation Guide for Local Governments in British Columbia \nnumber of BC local governments are leading the way, and some of their actions are dis\n-cussed below. There are many ways that governments can use land use planning and re\n-lated regulatory powers to help make their communities more resilient to climate change \nimpacts over time.\nAdaptation brings home the need to break down silos within local governments. Climate \nchange impacts cut across nearly every area of local government service and responsibility.\nFor example, planning for infrastructure that will be resilient to future climate change \nimpacts raises questions about capacity and vulnerability, patterns of development and \n\ngreen infrastructure options, costs of maintenance, operation, upgrading and replacement, \noptions for financing, and operations during emergencies. Engineers, land use planners, \nasset managers or financial planners and emergency planners all need to be engaged at \nsome stage. Internal communications are very important. Some communities have found \nit useful to develop a climate change adaptation committee or team that can explore how \n\nto identify and manage climate change impacts and responses across a local government. \n\nBuilding communities that are resilient in the face of future changes will require internal \ncooperation and collaboration in addition to the external collaboration described in Part 1.\nIn terms of adaptation strategies themselves, several themes emerge from practices and \nexperience to date:\nApproaches that maintain and enhance the interconnectedness of communities \n\nwith natural systems\n Š low impact development, green infrastructure \nfor rainwater management, protecting ecological values within urban \n\nboundaries\n Š seem to offer increased resilience to a changing climate as well as \nimportant co-benefits;\nStrategies that emphasize more efficient use of resources and operation of \n\nequipment and facilities are also important for improving resilience where the \n\nimpacts of climate change may result in shortages of resources such as energy or \n\nwater, or increased demands on infrastructure during extreme weather event; and\nThe need to adapt to a changing climate points towards regional scale responses \n\nin certain areas: for example, watershed management, food security and \nemergency planning and response. \nAll of these themes are illustrated with references to examples from BC and in some cases \nelsewhere in Canada.\nNot all of the examples provided in Part 2 were developed specifically as climate change \nadaptation strategies, but they have been included because they nonetheless offer signifi\n-\ncant adaptation benefits, and can be considered to be part of the toolkit available to local \n\ngovernments developing climate change adaptation strategies.\nPart 2 concludes with a brief discussion of some of the legal liability and insurance issues \nthat may arise for local governments in the context of climate change adaptation.\nPart 2 first examines the \nhigher-level community \n\nplans under the Local \n\nGovernment Act \nthat \nlocal governments \n\ncan use to implement \n\nclimate change \n\nadaptation strategies. \nANNACIS\n ISLAND PHOTO\n COURTES\nY L\nORI&T\nODD/FLICKR', '28LAND USE PLANNINGRegional Growth StrategiesIntegrating climate change adaptation into  regional growth strategies or regional-scale planningThere are three main areas where regional growth strategies can promote climate change \nadaptation:\n1.

It also addresses \n\ninfrastructure, housing, and greenhouse gas reduction targets, and can extend to social needs, agriculture \n\nand environmental protection and other matters. The OCP provides the framework for local government \n\ndecision-making: all bylaws and local government decisions, including capital expenditures, must be \n\nconsistent with the OCP, once it has been legally adopted by a local government. As well, an OCP is developed \n\nthrough a process that includes public consultation, and this provides an opportunity to have a community \n\ndialogue about climate change impacts and possible actions. OCP policies and objectives can also inform \n\nconsiderations of public interest made by Approving Officers with respect to subdivision applications.\nOf˜cial Community PlansIntegrating climate change adaptation into an OCPAn Official Community Plan is one of the key planning tools available to a local gov\n-ernment to put in place climate change adaptation strategies that will be reflected in \ndecision-making about land use and development within its jurisdiction. Both the plan\n-ning process and the product are important. Depending on how far a local government \nhas advanced in assessing climate change impacts and developing climate change \n\nadaptation strategies, an OCP can be used in different ways to support action:\nWhen a local government has already assessed its risks and vulnerabilities to \nclimate change impacts, or is prepared to undertake this process together with \na significant revision of its OCP, there is the possibility to address climate change \nadaptation \ncomprehensively\n across the policies and objectives within the OCP, \nand mainstream associated action throughout all guidelines and regulations; or\nFor local governments that are just beginning to look at climate change impacts \n\nand the risks and vulnerabilities in their community, and have limited resources, \n\nthe OCP can be used to frame specific climate change adaptation objectives to \nadvance climate change assessment and planning, and/or to modify specific \npolicies and objectives to incorporate adjustments to climate change impacts \n\nwhere there is enough existing information to do so; or\nFor local governments that develop stand-alone plans the OCP will need to \n\nbe amended to include the appropriate policies, objectives, maps and related \nmaterial.\nWhichever approach is selected, the goal over time should be for local governments \n\nto develop a comprehensive approach to managing climate impacts, and to have this \nreflected in the OCP. Climate change impacts cut across different local government \n\npolicy areas and functions, and through its OCP a local government can put in place \n\na holistic and integrated approach to addressing impacts across its jurisdiction. It is a \nway to support the mainstreaming of climate change adaptation into local government \nOver time local \ngovernments should \n\naim to mainstream \n\nclimate change \n\nadaptation into local \n\ngovernment policy \n\nand decision-making, \n\nincorporating \n\ninput from climate \n\nscience experts.\nNELSON PHOTO\n COURTES\nY \n78\nSPEED/FLICKR', '31decision-making. Although the OCP itself does not legally bind a local government to proceed with \nany project, putting climate change adaptation policy objectives in the OCP ensures that subsequent \nlegal enactments, such as zoning bylaws, must be consistent with those objectives.\nThe OCP can offer a relatively long term planning horizon, and local governments could consider \na planning horizon of 50Œ100 years in relation to the development of climate change policies and \nobjectives aimed at shifting developments and land use patterns over time. It is important to antici\n-\npate future climate impacts now, before decisions made today result in safety hazards or expensive \ndamage to infrastructure over the longer term. The draft City of Prince George OCP indicates, for \nexample, that the climate change impact priorities it has identified should be considered in new \n\ndevelopment proposals.\n18Having climate change adaptation objectives identified in the OCP can also provide ongoing mo\n-mentum for local government action, and a rationale for committing resources for adaptation work. \nThe Thetis Island OCP states that ﬁThe Local Trust Committee should consider the development of \nnew criteria for assessing official community plan or land use bylaw amendment applications from \n\nthe perspective of climate change adaptation and mitigation.ﬂ\n19An OCP can also direct a local government to take action to further its own strategic objectives \n\nthrough cooperation and partnership with other governments and organizations.

DPAs for wildfire hazards may also \n\ninclude requirements about landscaping and the siting, form, \n\nexterior design and finish of buildings. DPAs can also be used \nto restrict development and protect and/or restore natural \nfeatures and areas, and can be used to help protect key nat\n-ural ecosystems in the face of climate change.\nDPAs can offer local governments a more flexible approach to \nregulating development than zoning because guidelines can \n\nspecify results and allow site-specific solutions.

These areas can also function as firebreaks.\n24A number of water-related climate impacts (decreased freshwater supplies, increased ero\n-sion from run-off during storms, saltwater intrusion in aquifers, and others) may be at least \npartly addressed through the use of the zoning power. Through zoning a local govern\n-ment can limit site coverage, or the impervious ﬁfootprintﬂ of buildings, structures, and \npaved parking areas and in this way promote onsite rainwater infiltration. As well, in areas \n\nwhere climate change is predicted to reduce the available supply of freshwater enough to \nhave a significant negative impact on the availability of water, a local government could \nconsider the option of low-density zoning to match demand to water supply.\n25Along marine shorelines, zoning can include requirements for density, buildings and site \n\ncoverage aimed at creating resilient development in the face of climate impacts like sea \n\nlevel rise and the potential for increased storm intensity. Sensitive shoreline areas can be \ndesignated as conservation areas to protect habitat and species.

A range of measures that may \nbe relevant for implementing climate change adaptation strategies can be ac\n-complished through the local government zoning power, from setbacks to pro\n-hibiting uses that may increase risk of harm in sensitive areas.

Hotter summers may drive up energy demand for cooling, for example, \n\nwhile carbon pricing policies within BC and globally are likely to increase the cost of \ntraditional energy sources. Greater resiliency to these changes might be achieved \nthrough measures to relax some common zoning requirements. For example, \n\nsetbacks can be reduced to allow buildings with thicker walls, or building height \n\nrequirements adjusted to allow solar energy installations.

For example, structures built today in a certain area, or respecting a given \n\nsetback, are likely to be around for 50Œ100 years or more, and will need to be safe \n\nand viable over \nat least that time period. The provision of local government services \nDENSITY \nBONUSESLocal Government Act\n, s.904\nLocal governments can designate zones where increased density, up to a specified \namount, is available to applicants in exchange for providing community amenities, \n\nor contributing to a fund that will be used by the local government to \ncreate amenities. In the climate change context local governments must \nbe careful to ensure that density is not being increased in areas that are \n\nprone to greater risks of natural hazards, such as flooding.\nThere may be opportunities to use density bonuses to assist in imple\n-menting climate change adaptation measures through the provision of \namenities, such as acquiring/developing land for community gardens to \nenhance food security, creating greenways that connect natural areas \n\nand enhance the resilience of natural species. Gardens and greenways \n\nmay also have important cooling benefits in urban areas subject to \n\nrising temperatures. Parks and greenways can protect environmentally \nsensitive areas that are at even greater risk as a result of climate change, \nand preserving trees and natural vegetation can contribute to rainwater \n\nmanagement. It should be noted that density bonusing can be con\n-\ntroversial, and the process should involve community dialogue. Good \npractices would include setting an upper limit on density and where it \nwill be located in the OCP after public dialogue, and creating a public \n\nand transparent process for calculating the value of increased density. \n\nSee \nwww.wcel.org/sites/default/files/publications/TheGreenBuildingsGuide.pdf\nA reminder: new \nor revised DPAs \n\nand guidelines \nmay require \namendments to the \nzoning bylaw to \nensure consistency. \nAll local government \nenactments must be \nconsistent with OCP.\n', '42associated with any zone will also need to be considered with this longer term climate \nchange lens. For this reason a precautionary approach based on hazard mapping \ninformed by up-to-date climate modeling data, or other pertinent information, is \nprudent. As well, periodic reviews of zoning requirements should be undertaken to \n\nensure that they are informed by current information about climate impacts.\nWhen defining zones, planners need to work with others who have the appropriate \n\nexpertise. In terms of wildfire hazards, for example, fire and forestry officials should \n\nbe involved in the planning process at the earliest stages so that hazards are well \n\narticulated before developments are planned. The costs of not mitigating hazards \n\nmust be evaluated. As well, both the suitability of the zone itself for a given type of \ndevelopment, and access to the area for the provision of emergency services and \nsecondary evacuation routes needs to be considered.\nZoning requirements may be seen by local governments as less resource-intensive \n\nto administer when compared to development permits. However, the zoning powers \n\n(uses, density, and siting, size and uses of buildings) also offer less opportunity to \ntailor development to site specific environmental conditions which may be important \nfrom the point of view of climate change adaptation. For example, zoning can address \n\nthe density and type of development in areas prone to wildfire hazards, but it cannot \n\nspecify the type of landscaping that must be carried out, exterior materials that must \n\nbe used on buildings, the types of reports that must be prepared and submitted, etc. \nFor this reason zoning bylaws will likely be more effective in terms of implementing \nclimate change adaptation measures when used in concert with development permit \n\nareas and other local bylaw powers.\nFood security has been \nidentified in a number \n\nof communities in BC \n\nas a climate change \nimpact of concern.

The planning period \nfor a financial plan is five years. \nCommunity Charter,\n s.165, \nLocal Government Act\n, s. 815.\nMunicipalities are also required to prepare an annual report that includes both audited \nfinancial statements and information about reaching the previous year™s objectives and \n\nmeasures, and how it will measure progress in meeting objectives for the next two years. \nCommunity Charter\n, s. 98.\nWhy look at long term ˜nancial planning part of climate change adaptation:Dealing with climate change impacts may have significant financial implications for local \ngovernments, in terms of increased expenditures, whether from managing increased risk \nand occurrence of natural hazards, dealing with greater wear-and-tear on infrastructure \nor the need to increase infrastructure capacity, training staff to understand and manage \n\nclimate change impacts, training staff or hiring consultants to assess risk and vulnerability, \n\nengaging with the public around impacts and goal-setting, and others. Planning ahead will \nprovide opportunities, for example, to identify investments that can enhance resiliency of \ninfrastructure to climate change impacts and to identify co-benefits or costs savings.\nClimate change may also have an impact, possibly negative, on local government rev\n-enues. Areas of fiscal risk and exposure need to be identified as part of the assessment \nof impacts a community will face as a result of climate change. As well, if a local govern\n-\nment decides to increase property taxes to modify or expand local government services \nto address climate impacts, it will need to ensure that this measure is accompanied by \nadequate public education about the climate impacts that are behind this decision.\nIncluding financial planning in climate change adaptation strategies will allow decision-\nmaking about adaptation options to be better informed. In choosing adaptation measures \n\nto be implemented, and weighing trade-offs, a key factor will be the financial resources \n\navailable, and whether a given measure has any other benefits (e.g. economic development, \n\nsavings on maintenance and operation costs, community liveability benefits.)\nPlanning ahead will provide opportunities, \n\nfor example, to identify \n\ninvestments that can \n\nenhance resiliency \n\nof infrastructure \n\nto climate change \n\nimpacts and to \n\nidentify co-benefits \n\nor costs savings.\nMOBERLEY L\nAKE PHOTO\n COURTES\nY E\nNERGETICCIT\nY', '60To consider:\nThere are important links between a financial plan and an OCP.

It is an opportun\n-\nity to explore alternative options for renewing infrastructure and at the same time plan \n\nfor climate resilience. One promising approach is to coordinate land use planning with \nlonger term financial and infrastructure planning in order to better understand the life \ncycle costs of infrastructure and look at ways to reduce or recover some of the costs.\n32Currently, in most communities the initial capital cost of municipal infrastructure related \n\nto development or re-development is covered by developers and property owners, while \n\nlocal governments become responsible for the long term cost associated with operation, \nmaintenance and replacement of infrastructure assets. These long term costs are typ\n-ically as much as four times the initial capital costs for conventional infrastructure. Green \ninfrastructure options, which can have important climate change adaptation benefits \n\n(see section on Infrastructure), may reduce life cycle costs while increasing resilience \nto climate change, and this can be explored in the context of long term planning for \nasset management.

It is intended to illustrate some of the areas where there may \n\nbe new or heightened potential for legal liability as a result of climate change and to encour\n-age local governments to take steps to evaluate and address their own circumstances. Local \n\ngovernments should consult with their own lawyers to obtain legal advice appropriate to their \ncircumstances.\nHow local governments respond to the impacts of climate change is also important from \nthe point of view of legal liability. Liability for local governments in the context of climate \n\nchange impacts is most likely to arise in the form of claims against the local government \n\nfor negligence or nuisance.\nA local government can be found to be negligent if it can be shown that, in exercising its \npowers, it failed to exercise reasonable care towards people to whom it owes a duty of \ncare.\n42 A key consideration is whether the harm in question was reasonably foreseeable.\n43 While there is still some degree of uncertainty associated with future climate change, the \nscientific evidence and related information that is now available make a range of climate \nchange impacts increasingly foreseeable for local governments. Accordingly it is becom\n-\ning less likely that a local government would be able to successfully defend a negligence \n\nclaim if it failed to take those impacts into account when exercising its statutory authority.\n44Local governments can also be exposed to nuisance claims, which are based on an inter\n-ference with the use or enjoyment of private property.\n45 A typical example is where a local \ngovernment sewerage or drainage system fails and causes property damage. With climate \nchange posing increasing challenges for local government infrastructure, there may be \nmore nuisance claims of this type arising.\n42 While the courts have made a distinction between policy and operational decisions, holding that \nonly operational decisions attract liability, this is a relatively complex area of law and the subject of \nsignificant litigation. In general, once a local government has decided to offer a program or service, \n\nit should ensure that the program or service is offered with reasonable care to those likely to be \n\nimpacted by the program or service. \n43 See \nMustapha v. \nCulligan of Canada Ltd\n., [2008] 2 S.C.R. 114.44 In Australia, planning tribunals have already recognized that climate change will affect coastal \n\ndevelopments. In \nGippsland Coastal Board v South Gippsland SC & Ors\n (No 2) [2008] VCAT 1545 (29 \nJuly 2008), an appeal tribunal overturned plans to build six seaside homes partly due to climate \n\nchange considerations. The case summary states: ﬁThe case is of particular interest because of \npotential sea level rises due to the effects of climate change. We conclude that sea level rise and \nrisk of coastal inundation are relevant matters to consider in appropriate circumstances. We accept \n\nthe general consensus that some level of climate change will result in extreme weather conditions \n\nbeyond the historical record that planners and others rely on in assessing future potential \nimpact. The relevance of climate change to the planning decision making process is still in an \nevolutionary phase. Each case concerning the possible impacts of climate change will turn on its \n\nown facts and circumstances. However, in the present case, applying the precautionary principle, \nwe consider that increases in the severity of storm events coupled with rising sea levels create a \nreasonably foreseeable risk of inundation of the subject land and the proposed dwellings, which is \n\nunacceptable.ﬂ Decision is online at \nwww.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VCAT/2008/1545.html\n 45 Lawsuits based on ﬁpublic nuisanceﬂ\n Š the interference with a public right in respect of public \nspaces or resources\n Š are also possible, but less likely due to restrictions on the ability of the \ngeneral public to bring such claims.\nA local government \ncan be found to be \n\nnegligent if it can be \n\nshown that, in exercising \n\nits powers, it failed to \n\nexercise reasonable care \n\ntowards people to whom \n\nit owes a duty of care.\nVANCOUVER\n LAW\n COURTS\n, PHOTO\n COURTES\nY A\nLEX MAHAN/FLICKR', '77While in some cases local governments can claim statutory immunity from nuisance \nclaims, the courts have indicated that they will interpret the statutory immunity narrow\n-ly.\n46 Damages related to flooding, in particular, can be extremely costly. The City of \nStratford, Ontario (with a population of around 30,000) paid $7.7 million to settle a class \naction lawsuit arising from flooding in its jurisdiction in 2002, in addition to $1.3˝mil\n-\nlion already paid out as emergency compensation.

Both increased community hazards and heightened \n\ndemands on services and infrastructure should be considered.\nSome examples of areas that local governments might wish to review in the context of \npotential legal liability and a changing climate include:\nVulnerability of existing infrastructure\n Š local governments might wish to \ninvestigate whether rising temperatures or other climate change impacts will \n\nresult in significant infrastructure failures that would not have been predicted \n\nbased on historical data;\nNew infrastructure\n Š new sewer systems, water or drainage facilities, dikes \nand roads that are insufficiently designed to take into account the impacts of \n\nclimate change could lead to liability for damages in the case of failure;\n48Permitting and inspections\n Š failing to take into account the risks associated \nwith climate change could potentially lead to liability for any losses resulting \nfrom permitted construction and other activities; and\nApproval of development in areas subject to increased risk of natural hazards \nlike flooding, landslides and wildfires linked to climate change impacts\n Š this could potentially expose local governments to liability.\n49In addition to the possibility that a local government will be liable for failing to adapt \n\neffectively to climate change, in some cases local governments may have the basis for a \nclaim themselves if they suffer losses related to climate change impacts that could have \nbeen prevented by appropriate adaptation by others.\n46 While the \nLocal Government Act\n, section 288 provides immunity to an action where damages arise \nas a result of a ﬁbreakdown or malfunctionﬂ of a sewage system, drainage facility, dike or road, \nthe courts have held that there is not immunity where damages arise from an insufficient design \nthat is simply inadequate for the purpose it was meant to fulfill.

Natural hazards, like floods and fire, are often the immediate cause of these \nlosses. These types of events can cause severe and widespread damage to local infra\n-structure and property, particularly when infrastructure fails as a result, not to mention \n\nthe public safety issues. An unusually violent and heavy rain storm in Toronto in August \n\n2005 was estimated to have cost $547 million.\n50 Fire services attended to more than 1,000 \ncalls, and rainfall in North \nYork was measured at 103 mm in one hour, much greater than \na one in one hundred year storm.\n51Because local governments are responsible for local infrastructure, and it would be dif\n-\nficult or impossible to maintain sufficient financial reserves to account for their losses \nrelated to these types of catastrophic events, they have traditionally relied on insurance \nto at least partly recover costs.\nThe insurance industry has been speaking out with respect to the need to take action to \naddress climate change. According to the Insurance Bureau of Canada, in recent years the \n\nfrequency and severity of sewer backup damage and claims has risen sharply across the \n\ncountry. Water damage is now the leading cause of property damage in Canada, totalling \n\naround $1.7 billion/year.\n52Faced with higher levels of risk, insurers have two options: restrict coverage, or increase \n\npremiums.

More \nrecently local governments in BC have been mandated to plan to reduce their green\n-house gas emissions, by setting greenhouse gas reduction targets. However, while \n\nefforts to slow climate change are critical, it is also necessary to plan for the climate \n\nchange that we already face. \nThe basis for good planning about adapting to climate change is good information, \nobtained through Plan2Adapt and other sources, and updated regularly. Each com\n-\nmunity needs to assess and monitor its vulnerabilities in light of the climate information \nit obtains. Climate change means that the past is no longer a good predictor of the fu\n-ture. Some impacts, such as sea level rise or increased wildfire risk, may require specific \n\nresponses. Adaptation strategies that enhance overall resilience are also being explored \n\nin a number of communities, as outlined in this guide. Low impact development and \ngreen infrastructure, emphasizing efficiencies in operations and the use of resources, \nand finding ways to cooperate and collaborate with neighbouring communities are all \n\nstrategies that may increase community resilience in a changing climate.  \n53 20 Canadian municipalities will be involved in collecting data to support the development of \nthe tool. \nwww.ibc.ca/en/Natural_Disasters/Municipal_Risk_Assessment_Tool.asp\n 54 Nicholas Heap (2007) \nHot Properties, How Global Warming Could Transform B.C.™s Real \n\nEstate Sector\n.

Local governments can help prepare their communities for climate change impacts \nover both the short and long term by making sure that decisions about land use in their jurisdictions \ntake these impacts into account. This can be accomplished most effectively by integrating climate \n\nchange adaptation into existing regulatory tools and policies.\nWhat is new about climate change adaptation is the need to look at longer term horizons, and to add \nclimate experts and additional public consultation to existing planning processes. There are innova\n-\ntive new tools available to local governments in BC, such as climate projections from Plan2Adapt, and \nnew guides and studies that can assist with the place-based analysis that is required to understand \nimpacts and prioritize actions. To be effective, adaptation strategies need to be integrated across \n\nlocal government areas of responsibility and service, and mainstreamed into practice. It is important \n\nfor local governments to recognize that the uncertainty associated with climate change, as well as \nthe need to fully consider the consequences of climate change impacts in their communities will \nnecessarily make local government analysis and decision-making more involved than in the past.\nThree land use scenarios that look at land use planning in the context of climate change are provided \nbelow:\n1.

The OCP is a forward-looking document prepared by local governments that sets out over\n-arching policies and objectives that apply to land use and development within their jurisdictions. \n\nOnce the OCP has been adopted in a bylaw, all other bylaws must be consistent with the OCP, such \n\nas land use and zoning bylaws, for example. The OCP also creates development permit areas (DPAs) \nwhere specified guidelines for development must be followed. Local governments have the power \nto create DPAs to protect the natural environment, to protect the community from hazardous condi\n-\ntions on land, and to establish objectives to promote conservation of water and energy.\nSome local governments that have developed or revised their OCPs in recent times have begun \nto expand the timeline covered by the OCP beyond the five- or 10-year planning horizon that has \n\npreviously been more typical. It is possible to consider timelines of 50Œ100 years. This recognizes \nthat decisions about land use, for example, have long term impacts in a community and can benefit \nfrom a long term vision. This approach is very compatible with preparing for the impacts of climate \n\nchange, which may also be gradual, but significant over the longer term. For example, it is important \n\nthat planning protect the community in areas that may be subject to increased risks of flooding or \nsea level rise over the longer term as a result of climate change.\nUsing an OCP to help mainstream climate change adaptation into land use planning by a local gov\n-ernment is more likely to be successful when climate change adaptation is fully integrated into the \nOCP, and the process and the product linked to different policy areas and objectives. It may be useful \n\nto discuss climate change adaptation in the opening section of the OCP, to indicate that it is a priority \n\nacross all relevant policies and objectives contained in the OCP. A stand-alone section with climate \nchange adaptation goals and policies can provide additional direction.\nSource: District of Elkford\nWILDFIRESElkford Impacts and Opportunities\n', '83Another critical part of the mainstreaming process is educating local government councils or \nboards, staff and the community about the projected climate change impacts in their community, \nand having them motivated to develop responses and able to implement them. The consultation \n\nundertaken as part of the process to revise or develop a new OCP needs to be broadened to include \n\neducation around climate change projections, impacts and strategies, and to include access to cli\n-\nmate scientists and local experts.\nExample: District of Elkford Of˜cial Community Plan 20101In 2008, the District of Elkford, a small mountain town in the Eastern Kootenays, was undertaking a \n\nrevision of its OCP. The District decided to integrate climate change adaptation planning into its OCP \n\nas a result of its participation in an initiative of the Columbia Basin Trust, \nCommunities Adapting to \n\nClimate Change \n(CCAC), that aimed to identify projected local climate change impacts and vulner\n-abilities, and develop adaptation plans.\nWith the assistance of funding through the CCAC, Elkford obtained historical and projected climate \ninformation from the Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium, and used this information to gather fur\n-ther scientific information about how Elkford and region could be affected by climate changes. The \n\nnext step was to develop ﬁimpact pathwaysﬂ showing the chain of impacts that could result from \n\nclimate change and how Elkford could be affected. These impact pathways helped to illustrate how \nmany different departments and service areas within Elkford would be affected, and that they all \nneeded to be involved in evaluating impacts and developing responses. Results were presented to \n\nthe community, and three priority areas were identified: wildfire, flooding/stormwater management, \n\nand water supply. This was followed by a vulnerability and risk assessment, and then action planning \n\nto develop an adaptation strategy.\nThe consultation undertaken by Elkford was significantly more extensive than what would have been \nconsidered typical for the development of an OCP. It was felt that this was important for building \n\nunderstanding and acceptance in the community and on council for integration of climate change \n\nadaptation into the OCP. Some of the outreach activities included displays at the mall that included \n\na quick survey, a paper and web-based survey, facilitated kitchen table meetings, and an open house \nthat was attended by members of the community as well as a number of current and local council \ncandidates running for election.\nThe Elkford OCP explicitly references the integration of the climate change adaptation strategy for \nthe community into that document, and notes that the OCP ﬁ–guides development for at least the \n\nnext 10-20 years and effectively addresses sound science regarding future changes in local weather \n\npatterns and climatic variables in the District.ﬂ\n2The Elkford OCP defines climate change adaptation and integrates adaptation goals and objectives \n\nthroughout the plan, across nearly all areas of policy and decision-making. Some examples include:\n1 See \nOfficial Community Plan, District of Elkford, 2010 \nwww.elkford.ca/official_community_plan\n; Karen Gorecki, \nMegan Walsh, Jeff Zukiwsky, \nDistrict of Elkford: Climate Change Adaptation Strategy \nwww.cbt.org/uploads/pdf/\nElkford_CACCI_Phase_1_Adaptation_Report.pdf\n2 Official Community Plan, District of Elkford, 2010\n, s.1.2 \nwww.elkford.ca/official_community_plan\n ', '84The OCP indicates that council may refer to climate change projections prepared by the \nPacific Climate Impacts Consortium and others in decision-making, and that bids, tenders \nand contracts for planning and development in the District shall make reference to climate \n\nchange and the Elkford Climate Change Adaptation Strategy;\nEstablishing a District Growth Boundary that will have multiple community benefits, \n\nincluding avoiding additional wildfire risks by limiting further development in wilderness \nareas;\nUpdating the flood plain designation to reflect current science;\nDeveloping a Parks and Trails Master Plan to implement climate change adaptation \nstrategies;\nPlacing new roads and sidewalks in locations where they can act as fire breaks and access \nroutes;\nRequiring that stormwater be retained on site in new subdivisions; and\nRestricting development in areas subject to natural hazards, including flooding, steep \nslopes and wildfire, through DPAs and other measures.\nThe Elkford OCP also lists bylaws and other District plans and processes that need to be updated \n\nand harmonized with the OCP, as well as proposing a number of new actions and studies that would \n\nassist in implementing the OCP and achieving climate change adaptation goals.\nSpecific monitoring and evaluation of climate change adaptation in the District is also identified as \nnecessary.\n', '85LAND USE SCENARIO 2: INCORPORATING CLIMATE SCIENCE ABOUT NATURAL HAZARDS INTO LAND USE PLANNINGLocal governments have important responsibilities to their communities with respect to public \nsafety, and the protection of people and property in the face of natural hazards.\nSome of the projected climate change impacts for BC, which vary by region, that may be relevant for \nlocal governments to consider in relation to natural hazards include:\n3Increased risk of wildfires;\nIncreased risk of flooding;\nIncreased risk of landslides on steep slopes;\nSea level rise;\nIncreased incidence of invasive species; and\nIncreased incidence of extreme storm events.\nTo prepare for natural hazards in the context of climate change, local governments need to obtain \n\nthe climate information relevant for their region, quantify risk and assess their vulnerabilities, and \nthen determine appropriate responses. Local governments can obtain information about projected \nclimate impacts for their regions from Plan2Adapt, by contracting specifically with the Pacific Cli\n-\nmate Impacts Consortium, by working with BC universities, through reviewing scientific literature, \nby enhancing staff capacity through training and collaboration, by hiring technical consultants, and \nother sources.\nApplying the information about local risks and vulnerabilities to land use planning is in some ways \nvery similar to conventional planning for natural hazards by local governments: land use needs to be \n\ndetermined so that the risks faced by different geographic areas within the community are accept\n-able in terms of the type of development and permitted uses in that area. Where risks are inevitable, \nplanning needs to ensure that emergency responses can be carried out as effectively as possible and \nthat key infrastructure functioning is maintained.\nWhat is different about preparing for climate change is that assessments of risk and vulnerability \nbased on historical events will not be good predictors of the risks faced in future, unless they factor \n\nin climate change projections. As well, risks and vulnerabilities should be periodically reassessed to \n\nincorporate evolving and updated information about climate change impacts.\n3 The risks related to natural hazards associated with climate change will be different for every region, and \neach local government should assess its own risks and vulnerabilities, incorporating climate information from \nsources such as Plan2Adapt \nhttp://pacificclimate.org/tools-and-data/plan2adapt\n', '86Example: City of Prince GeorgePrince George is a northern BC community that faces significant impacts associated with a changing \nclimate. It is located at the confluence of the Nechako and Fraser, with significant development \n\nwithin the floodplain. It is also surrounded by forests that have been severely affected by mountain \n\npine beetle. The Nechako River has historically been subject to ice jams that can cause flooding in \nPrince George. In the winter of 2007/2008 there was a 35 km long ice jam that caused extensive \nflooding.\n4 Prince George is also in a region affected by the mountain pine beetle epidemic, and both \nsurrounding forested lands and trees within municipal boundaries have been damaged.\nFaced with questions and potential challenges related to climate change, Prince George has been \nworking with the Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium and researchers from the University of North\n-ern BC\n5 to assess the climate change impacts faced by the City, and to develop adaptation priorities.\nOver the next 50 years, annual temperatures in Prince George are projected to increase by 1.6°C to \n2.5°C, and precipitation is projected to increase by 3% to 10%. The changes are expected to be more \ndramatic in winter, and more precipitation is expected to fall as rain. The result is likely to be more \n\nflooding and more extreme events such as wildfires, windstorms and extreme precipitation events.\n6 Based on these projections Prince George has been taking action to explore and address flooding \nand wildfire risks.\nIn 2009 Prince George hired technical consultants to prepare a flood risk evaluation that included cli\n-mate change projections. While a number of flood control options were identified for Prince George, \nincluding enlarging existing side channels, building dikes and flood-proofing buildings, changing \nland use in flood prone areas was found to be a potentially cost-effective solution in certain cir\n-cumstances. Public consultation about flood control options demonstrated that there was public \n\nsupport for proactive measures, largely because of the extensive damage that Prince George had \nexperienced in past flood events. In 2011 Prince George adopted a new Flood Plain Regulation Bylaw \n4 Environment Canada. \nCanada™s Top Weather Stories for 2008, Regional Weather Highlights 2008, British Columbia\n. www.ec.gc.ca/meteo-weather/default.asp?lang=En&n=ACC549AF-1\n 5 With funding from Natural Resources Canada and assistance from the Fraser Basin Council.\n6 See City of Prince George. \nPrince George Community Climate Change Adaptation \nhttp://princegeorge.ca/\n\nenvironment/climatechange/adaptation/pages/default.aspx\n, and also http://princegeorge.ca/environment/\nclimatechange/adaptation/Documents/2012_PGRAC_CaseStudy_Volume3_Forests.pdf\n Downstream view of the Nechako River during winter 2007/08 showing the ice-related flooding of the industrial \narea (dashed line) on the floodplain; damage to infrastructure and property. \nSource: CEBC 2011 Award for \nEngineering Excellence: Managing Price George™s Rising Flood Waters,\n NHC Consultants and City of Prince George.\n', '87that updated flood plain mapping and which regulates all new development in the designated flood \nplain. In a report to council regarding the amendments City staff noted that the mapping would \nlikely need to be periodically reviewed and updated.\n7As a result of the mountain pine beetle epidemic, Prince George has been working to adapt to the \n\nimpacts of climate change in its forest management and operations for more than a decade. Since \n\n2006 it has had a Community Forest Agreement with the provincial government, which has allowed \nit to manage areas of forested Crown land within City limits. The City has engaged in fuel treatment \nactivities including salvage harvesting and thinning operations to reduce wildfire hazards, and has \n\nfunded these activities through grants from NRCAN and UBCM. Prince George has also developed \n\na Community Wildfire Protection Plan that includes measures such as guidelines for new develop\n-ments, identifying fire hazard areas and public education.\n8While it has been an early leader in climate change adaptation at the local government level, Prince \n\nGeorge is continuing to develop and implement strategies to address the changing climate.\n7 Ibid.

Citizens and elected officials will need to have a basic understand\n-ing of the climate change projections and impacts in their communities so that they can make \n\ninformed decisions. There may also be cases where priorities with respect to land uses are at issue. \n\nIn areas subject to increased risks with respect to natural hazards as a result of climate change, for \n\nexample, a community might need to weigh the costs and benefits of protection versus relocation. \nHowever, the implications of climate change at the local level can be complex, and challenging for \ncommunities to understand.\nThe Collaborative for Advanced Landscape Planning at the University of British Columbia\n9 has developed an innovative visioning tool that has proven effective in helping communities to under\n-stand the impacts of climate change in their region, to appreciate the urgency in certain cases, \nand to prioritize actions. The tool brings together climate data with visual representations of local \n\ngeography and neighbourhoods, and allows community members to see vivid representations of \n\npotential climate impacts. Some of the impacts modeled to date include snow pack reductions on \nthe North Shore mountains (District of North Vancouver); sea level rise and flood adaptation (City of \nDelta) and wildfire events (City of Kimberley). The tool has been used in interactive public settings in \n\na number of BC communities, and has received very positive feedback from community members.\nThere is a guidance manual for the tool for BC local governments that is available free of charge. The \ntool can be used with existing planning resources including Google Earth, GIS and CommunityViz \n\ncapabilities.\n10 Three additional training modules for the use of the tool are being developed.\nExample: City of KimberleyThe City of Kimberley in southeastern BC is a small community that relies on tourism and outdoor \n\nrecreation. It faces potential climate change impacts that include flooding, wildfire, water supply \nissues, and others.\nAs part of the Kimberley Climate Adaptation Project supported by the Columbia Basin Trust, Kim\n-berley worked with CALP to pilot a climate change visioning process, that ﬁuse[d] tools such as \nGIS mapping and 3D visualizations to localize, spatialize and visualize climate change impacts and \nsolutions.ﬂ\n11 In particular, the visualizations gave community members the opportunity to ask ﬁwhat \nifﬂ questions and see the outcomes modeled before them.\n9 With support from the Ministry of Community, Sport and Cultural Development.\n10 www.calp.forestry.ubc.ca/news/viz-guidance-manual/\n 11 CALP Visioning and Visualizations: Kimberley Climate Adaptation Project, Final Project Report to the Real Estate \nFoundation Communities in Transition Program \nhttp://cfubc.ehosting.ca/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/REF-\n\nCALP-Kimberley-Report2.pdf\n ', '89The mapping and visualizations that were produced included vulnerabilities to wildfire and flood\n-ing. Options for reducing vulnerabilities or adapting to changes were also provided. A summary of \nthe visualizations was presented to an open house in Kimberley.\nThe strongest audience response came from the virtual fire tour which situated the projected \n\nforest fire season extension under climate change within a localized ﬁfire storyﬂ. First, a 3D \n\nhistorical fire map showed the last 100 years of fires around Kimberley. Further mapping \ndisplayed in the virtual globe illustrated that the forest ecosystems around Kimberley are \nboth fire-dependent, and heavily fuel-loaded due to fire suppression. Then, fire modeling \n\nresults for a simulated current forest fire that starts southwest of the City were shown: each \n\nhour of the fire was layered on the virtual landscape in a time sequence, showing the fire \n\ncutting off the Highway access in three hours and reaching the City of Kimberley in four \nhours. The audience visibly responded by sitting up and there was an audible intake of \nbreath in the room. The virtual tour then illustrated how the fire season could extend under \n\nclimate change: currently starting in May, it could be starting as early as mid-March by the \n\n2040s, and mid-February by the 2080s. Again, the time slider in Google Earth was used to \n\nshow the possible future shift, and again the audience visibly and audibly reacted as they \nabsorbed the information.\n12Surveys conducted among attendees following the Open House indicated that the visualizations \nhad been useful in helping people to understand the link between climate change and land use \n\ndecisions. Reduction of wildfire risk and a fuel treatment program were among the recommended \nactions in the report prepared for the City.\n1312 Ibid.13 Adapting to Climate Change in Kimberley, BC, Report and Recommendations June 2009\n (Prepared by Ingrid Liepa)\nwww.cbt.org/uploads/pdf/Kimberley_CACCI_Phase_1_Adaptation_Report.pdf\n Historic fire map: Google Earth image of previous forest fires around Kimberley \n (data source: Bob Gray).

It is meant to trigger further investigation and discussion about adaptation \noptions and strategies. Occasional references to further resources are included. Because adaptation \n\nis an ongoing process, many of these questions will ideally be revisited over time. This checklist is \n\nmeant to be a practical supplement to the information provided in Part 1 of this guide, and to help \nlocal governments move to the stage where they are ready to implement climate change adaptation \nstrategies as discussed in Part 2.\nAs described in Part 2, the Official Community Plan (OCP) will be one of the main tools used to imple\n-ment adaptation strategies, together with a number of local government bylaw powers and other \nactivities that can be used to make communities more resilient to a changing climate. However, prior \n\nto updating an OCP it is important to start assessing potential climate change impacts, as well as \noptions for addressing impacts based on community vulnerability, resources, capacity, local context \nand other factors. Even where local governments have limited resources available for climate change \n\nadaptation, there are ways to begin preparing, as described in \nAppendix D\n Š Considerations for Local \nGovernments with Limited Resources\n.While efforts have been made to include as many useful questions as possible, the checklist is not \nexhaustive. Extra space has been provided so that users can add their own questions.\nThere will be overlap among the topic areas set out below. A good way to start a review of the check\n-list is to establish an inter-departmental committee, have a meeting, and go through the questions \ntogether in order to explore different viewpoints and start to understand the linkages. It is also use\n-ful to review the questions for each of the different types of impacts and to ask ﬁwhat if–ﬂ questions.\n', '91MAKING THE MOST OF THE CHECKLIST: \n UNDERSTAN\nDING CLIMATE\n CHANGE AND \nADAPTATION\nMaking the most effective use of this checklist will require a basic understanding of cli\n-mate change and adaptation, local impacts, and how to assess risks and vulnerabilities. \nIn particular, the following background would be considered helpful:\na. Climate change adaptation\n Š an understanding of the difference between climate \nchange mitigation and adaptation is necessary. See, for example, the diagram and \ndiscussion on pages 10-12 of this guide.\nb.\n Climate change projections (how will the global climate change?)\n Š basic knowledge \nmight be acquired, for example, through a review of resources such as:\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.youtube.com/\nwatch?v=ECJtF7Cf\nYcA\n\n\nhttp://pics.uvic.ca/education/\nclimate-insights-101\nc.\n Climate change projections at the regional level (how will the climate change in BC \ncommunities?)\n Š climate change information for BC regions is available from the \nPlan2Adapt tool \nhttp://pacificclimate.org/tools-and-data/plan2adapt\n including:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd.\n Risks and vulnerability\n Š Adaptation is place-based. Each community will need \nto review its particular situation, identify what the local government controls, and \nhow planning and operations might be affected by climate change. The questions \nbelow are aimed at helping local governments begin to work through this process, \nand explore some of the options for adapting. It is important to plan for multiple \n\nevents, e.g. unusually high temperatures and power outages. See \nAppendix A: \n\nFurther resources\n for help with assessing risks and vulnerability.\nNote:  Understanding that the past will no longer be a good predictor of the future is \na key part of adapting to climate change. Local government staff and elected repre\n-sentatives will need to be aware of the ﬁnew normalﬂ: the climate of the future will be \ndifferent than the climate of the past. For example, extreme weather events such as heat \n\nwaves, drought and storms may become more frequent and more severe. Flooding and \n\nwildfires may be more frequent or extensive, or both, than previously experienced. As a \nconsequence, it is important to recognize that what worked in the past to address these \ntypes of challenges will not necessarily work for the future.\n', '92Getting started on climate change adaptation Has the Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium (PCIC) Plan2Adapt modeling (\nhttp://\npacificclimate.org/tools-and-data/plan2adapt\n) for the region been accessed to gain an \nunderstanding of the projected climate scenarios and impacts?\n Has a review of climate change impacts and management considerations (for the local \ngovernment) been completed?\n If appropriate, has locally relevant, downscaled climate modeling been obtained?\n Is council/board well-briefed on climate change impacts in the community and the \nrationale for action?\n Has the community engaged in a climate change assessment process that has identified \nvulnerabilities, quantified risk, and decided on priority areas for action?\n Has local knowledge about climate change and its impacts been included in the \nassessment process?\n If a climate change assessment process has not yet been undertaken, could this process be \n\nlinked to OCP review and updating?\n Has a list of key stakeholders for consultation and possible partners for implementation \n\nof adaptation strategies been identified (noting that this list needs to include climate \n\nscientists, emergency personnel, and others who might not typically be consulted)?\n Have any important information gaps related to climate change impacts and adaptation \nbeen identified, and a course of action determined?\n Has a scan of programs, policies and bylaws that could be affected by, or could include \n\nclimate change adaptation, been carried out?\n What actions are already in place that can be considered adaptation?\n Given the projected climate change impacts in the community, what level of resources is it \n\nappropriate to commit for staff, and/or consultants?\n Which staff representatives (area/level) should be on an interdepartmental climate change \nadaptation committee\n Š finance/ asset management, engineering/operations and works, \nplanning, parks and recreation, emergency preparedness, communications, etc.?\n Should a select, standing or advisory committee be established?\n Are there currently in-stream applications or proposed developments or civic projects that \n\nshould be re-evaluated in light of climate change impacts?\n ____________________________________________________________ ____________________________________________________________ ____________________________________________________________ ____________________________________________________________', '93Regional and provincial context Are there any existing or proposed provincial guidelines that require consideration \nof climate change impacts relevant to the community?

The deci\n-sions that are being made today by local governments will critically affect the ability of their com\n-\nmunities to manage the impacts of many of these changes in the future.\nPart 1 of this Guide presents some high level information about climate change in BC, and back\n-ground about adaptation and how communities can obtain scientific information relevant to their \ncommunities, assess their vulnerabilities and risks and prioritize actions. These steps are necessary \nbefore climate change adaptation strategies can be developed.

The six step process set out in \nPathways to Climate Change \n\nResilience: A Guidebook for Forest Based Communities\n15 is reproduced on page 103. It is hoped that \nthis material might help some local governments be in a better position to begin implementing the \n\nclimate change strategies described in Part 2 of this Guide.

The tool is from the Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium (PCIC) \nat the University of Victoria. \nhttp://pacificclimate.org/tools-and-data/plan2adapt\n The \n\nprojections are at a regional scale, however some communities have contracted with PCIC \n\nto get information scaled down to a local level, where possible.\nThe City of Prince George has prepared a series of short videos about climate change \n\nimpacts in their region and some of the actions they are taking. \nwww.youtube.com/playlist\n?list=PLC9CCE982F121480C\nLocal observations can be an additional source of information about changing weather \n\npatterns in the community.

Local governments should be aware that an accurate understanding of the climate \nimpacts in their region will likely require expert assistance, whether from PCIC, through BC universi\n-ties, or possibly through provincial or federal government departments or agencies.\nSome ways to increase local capacity for climate change adaptation\nEngage community stakeholders and experts in consultation (e.g. community leaders, \nbusinesses, local scientists, university/college representatives, utilities, non-governmental \norganizations, recreation groups, and interested stakeholders).\nCheck in with neighbouring communities, regional districts and First Nations to see what \n\nthey have done, and where there may be opportunities for partnership or cooperation.\nConsider creating a citizens advisory committee on climate change adaptation to act as \n\nan ongoing resource and sounding board for staff as climate change impacts are assessed, \npriorities identified, and adaptation strategies are developed and implemented.\n Assessing risk and vulnerabilities, and prioritizing actionsAdaptation is place-based so each community will have to assess its own unique situation.\nReview the community™s local geography, environmental and regional context \nfor climate change impacts. Some of the typical impacts facing BC communities \n\n(depending on where they are located in the province) include: increased risk \nof riparian flooding; sea level rise and erosion in coastal areas; increased wildfire \nrisk; changes in wind patterns and tree blow down; aquifer and water supply \n\nissues. Community risk and vulnerability to these impacts are important factors in \n\nprioritizing action. For example, if the climate change impact is a high risk of sea \n\nlevel rise of 1 m by 2100, but the local topography is 5-meter rocky bluffs along \nthe shoreline, then the community likely has a low vulnerability to coastal erosion. \nBy contrast, a community with low-elevation coastal areas may be extremely \n\nvulnerable if faced with the same risk.\nReview land use development patterns, locations of key facilities (e.g. hospitals, \n\nemergency facilities, works yards etc.), transportation/ emergency routes and check \nfor connectivity and stranding in the case of emergencies arising from natural \nhazards associated with climate change such as flooding or wildfire, green space \n\nand sensitive habitats and check demographics, socio-economic factors, housing \n\n(location, age, rental) to identify vulnerable populations, etc. Part 2 of this Guide has \nfurther information about climate change adaptation considerations with respect to \nmany of the services and responsibilities of local governments.\nUse the risk evaluation matrix to help prioritize actions.\n', '106Sample Risk Evaluation Matrix which may help in prioritizing actions16Think about how to address in-stream applications and identify any big projects that may \nbe at very preliminary stages. Consider prioritizing a review of climate change adaptation \nconsiderations for these projects.\nCommunity engagement is very important. Some climate adaptation strategies will require \n\nsignificant investment of tax dollars and local government resources. Citizens and elected \nofficials will need to have a basic understanding of the climate change impacts in their \n\ncommunities so that they can make informed decisions. In areas subject to increased risks \n\nwith respect to natural hazards as a result of climate change, for example, a community \n\nmight need to weigh the costs and benefits of protection versus relocation. See Land use \nscenarios #1 and #3 in Appendix B for further ideas about community engagement.\nIn communities where funds are not available for adaptation planning, review the checklist \nin Appendix C in light of risks and vulnerabilities that have been identified.\n16 Note that time is also an important variable to be considered\n Š when will consequences be felt, and how long \ndoes it take to address them or put in place measures to anticipate them?\nSource: \n Robert A.
