This guideline document does\n not specifically address geotechnical design, \nstructural design or construction \nstandards, which may be indirectly\n affected by some aspects of \nsea level rise.  Qualified professionals with specialist engineering or environmental expertise must \n\nbe involved and retained to design specific projec\nt components and to facilitate agency approvals. \nThis document, and the companion document \nﬁGuidelines for Management of Coastal Flood \nHazard Land Use 2010ﬂ\n1 are specific to flood hazards arising from the exposure of BC lands to \nthe sea. In some locati\nons, specifically river estuaries, \nthe lands will also be exposed to other \nsources of flooding. These new documents are companion documents to the existing guideline \ndocuments which address flooding hazard from rivers\n2.  Analysis of flooding hazard from all \nsources Œ rivers and the sea - \nwill be required in\n estuaries.

Design will be performed at diffe\nrent levels of detail: - Conceptual design \n- Feasibility design \n- Detailed design. \n\nThis guideline is aimed at serv\ning the conceptual design stage. \n2.2 Definitions \nA summary of definitions and terminology used in\n this document is provided in Appendix A. \nWhere possible the same terminology and defini\ntions as used in the existing documents; \nDike \nDesign and Construction Guide 2003\n2 and Land Use Guidelines 2004\n4 are used; however, as \nthe existing terminology and definitions sometimes \nneed modification, clarification or expansion to \nbe appropriate for coastal conditions, in some cases new or revised terminology and definitions are \nproposed.  It is recommended that the reader of\n the updated documents familiarize themselves \nwith the updated terminology and definitions in Appendix A as necessary. \n2.3 Reference Documents \nThis Guideline document refers to several publicatio\nns that are recognized as current examples of \nbest practice for the design of coastal engineerin\ng structures, including s\nea dikes.  Where such \nreference is made it is intended to refer to the most current edition, as listed below, and to all \namendments or updates published thereto.  It should be noted that a Building Code or Standard \ndoes not exist in Canada for coastal engineering structures. \nThe referenced publications and Standards li\nsted below are intended to provide guidance on \ninternationally accepted best practice.  In some\n cases inter-comparison of documents will reveal \nseveral approaches may apply.  In these situat\nions; theoretical analysis, evaluation of the \napproaches for application to the specifics of \nBritish Columbia coastal waters and recognized \nengineering practise should be used to select among alternative methods. \nDirect measurement of specific\n parameters, over appr\nopriate intervals of time, may also be \nnecessary or advisable. \nDetailed site or structure specific engineering in\nvestigations may also provide equivalent guidance \nfor design. \n2.3.1 Standards \nInternational Organization for Standardization, 2007. \nActions from Wave and Currents on \nCoastal Structures.

A sea dike is no\nt intended to protect the shoreline or the adjacent \nseabed against erosion, although this may become a \nsecondary aspect of the sea dike design, or \nthe sea dike may be incorporated into a larger proj\nect with erosion protection, shoreline restoration \nor marine habitat preservation as concurrent objectives. \nDesign criteria that are required but not specific\nally addressed in this guideline document include: \n- The safety standard, design and service \nobjectives to be achieved by the dike \n- The design life of the dike \n- Inspection, maintenance and replacement or decommissioning of the dike. \nGuidance regarding these design criteria is provided in the companion document: \nPolicy \nDiscussion Paper 2010\n3. 3.2 Design Environment \n3.2.1 General \nThis section describes the evaluation of physical \nenvironmental conditions that will be required to \ndefine the main functional or geometric aspects of a sea dike. \n3.2.2 Location of Facility (Referen\nce elevation Œ depth of water) \nThe water depths and terrestrial elevations at the \nlocation of a sea dike shall be determined from \nsite-specific bathymetric and topographic survey\ns referenced to a common vertical and horizontal \ndatum.  Where bathymetric and topographic survey\ns are undertaken with respect to a separate \ndatum, the relationship between the bathymetric \ndatum and the topographic datum shall be defined \nover the entire project area. \nThe relationship between the bathymetric surv\ney datum, the topographic survey datum and the \ntidal datum for the area shall also be defined over the project area\n5. 3.2.3 Sea Level Rise \nGlobal Climate Change Sea Level Rise \n\nSea Level Rise is predicted to be moderate in t\nhe period from 2010 to 2025. However, the rate is \npredicted to increase more quickly in the period \nleading up to 2100, and then continue to increase \nsteadily.  For the purpose of this document the curr\nent definition of the expected Sea Level Rise is \nprovided in Figure 3-1.  The basis for this \ndefinition is provided in the policy document: \nPolicy \nDiscussion Paper 2010\n3.                                                       \n 5 In 2010 the vertical reference plane in Canada is in the \nprocess of being changed from a MSL related datum plane Œ \ntechnically known as CGVD28 Œ to a geoid based\n datum plan.  The update program is described at \nhttp://www.geod.nrcan.gc.ca/hm/index_e.php\n.  For the purpose of this document\n we use the term CGD to mean the \ndatum as defined in 2010 and approximately equal to MSL.\n ', ' Rev: 0 \nDate: 27 January 2011 \n\nProject No:  143111:  BC\n Ministry of Environment\n /Climate Change Adaption Guidelines for Sea Dikes and Coastal Flood Hazard Land Use 5 \n  Figure 3-1: Projections of Sea Level Rise \nsource: Policy Discussion Paper (2010) \n Figure 3-1 illustrates the range of \nuncertainty in projections, showing a median projection, as well \nas a range in projections from low to high. The un\ncertainty increases into the future. As described  \nin the policy document: \nPolicy Discussion Paper 2010\n3, it is recommended that sea dike design \nand assessment be based on the Recommended Curve for Sea Level Rise Policy in BC, shown on \nFigure 3-1. \nUnless scientific information warrants an earlier review, the Recommended Curve should be \nupdated in five years and then again by 2025, as we\nll as at least once every 25 years thereafter. \nRegional Sea Level Rise \nGlobal sea level rise expectations must be adjusted to account for regional variations and for \ncrustal movements particular to the area under cons\nideration.  Regional variations to be considered \ninclude: \n Variations particular to the Pacific Ocean Basin and to the NW Pacific portion;\n6  Variations particular to c\noastal British Columbia waters; \n Local variations caused by crustal movement, leading to land uprising or subsidence, which \nmay offset or exacerbate the sea level rise. \nThe BC Sea Level Report (2008)\n provides the most recent summary of expected regional or local \nclimate change effects on sea level rise.  Recommended local variations for crustal movement are \n                                                     \n 6 Available satellite measurements of rec\nent sea level rise show considerable variation around the globe compared to \nthe often quoted global means. Specific information on \nthe regional variation expected over the North Pacific and \noffshore coastal British Columbia during upcoming climate \nchange is not as readily available at this time.  This \nregional effect\n remains an element of uncertainty. \nSea Level Change\nrelative to 2000 [m]\n543210Recommended Curve for Sea\nLevel Rise Policy in BC \n', ' Rev: 0 \nDate: 27 January 2011 \n\nProject No:  143111:  BC\n Ministry of Environment\n /Climate Change Adaption Guidelines for Sea Dikes and Coastal Flood Hazard Land Use 6 \nprovided in Chapter 3.0 - \nBC Sea Level Report (2008)\n. Additional detail on subsidence rates for \nspecific areas of coastal BC area are provided in Appendix B. \n \nIn general terms, for most of coastal British Co\nlumbia, with the exception of the Lower Mainland \narea and the Richmond Œ Delta regions in particular\n, vertical land movement is positive (rising) at \nrates between 1 and 3 mm/yr.  Over a period of 10\n0 years this will decrease\n the expected global \nSLR by 0.1 to 0.3 m, but not enough to overco\nme the expected effects of climate change. \nSubsidence is expected in the Richmond-Delta regi\non at average rates of 1 to 2 mm/yr.  Over a \nperiod of 100 years these rates will increase the \nexpected sea level rise due to global SLR by 0.1 \nto 0.2 m. 3.2.4 Astronomical Tides \nPredictions of expected water levels due to astronomical tides are available throughout coastal \nBritish Columbia from the Canadian Hydrographic Service (CHS), Fisheries and Oceans Canada \nand are published annually under the authority of CHS.  Volumes 5 through 7 of the Canadian Tide \nand Current Tables (issued annually) provide su\nfficient information on astronomical tidal \ncharacteristics for planning and preliminary design \nthroughout most of BC coastal areas, through a \ncombination of Principal Reference Ports and numerous Secondary Ports. \nAs the tidal information at Secondary Ports is \noften based on limited durations of observations \n(typically one month or possibly less), they may no\nt be current and as they only provide corrections \nfor times and heights of specific \ntide parameters, project \nspecific tidal measurement programs must \nbe undertaken for all projects, at the project location, prior to detailed design. \nIndicative tidal ranges are summarized in Table 3-1.  The published data in Volumes 5 through 7 of \nthe Canadian Tide and Current Tables for specific\n areas within each general region should be \nconsulted as tidal ranges can vary by 1 m or more within each region.  Tidal ranges within a river \nestuary will also vary significantly; both by loca\ntion within the estuary and according to river \ndischarge.  Guidelines are available in Volume 5 for the Fraser River. \nThe tide ranges given in Table 3-1 have additional variation as noted below: \n Inter-annual variation due to the 18.6 year cycle \nof tides (typically of the order of ± 0.1 m) \n Intra-annual (seasonal) variation due to the \nparticulars of the astronomical bodies and orbits \ndriving the tidal forcing \nIn coastal British Columbia waters, the mean tida\nl water level during the typical stormy winter \nseason (approximately mid-October through mid-January) will not be equal to the MWL from the \nCHS published information as represented below in Table 3-1. \nDefinition of the Designat\ned Flood Level for the design of a sea \ndike will require definition of a \ncombination of appropriate tidal water levels and meteorological related water levels. \nJoint probability analysis methods are often used \nto define appropriate combinations of tide and \nstorm surge that reflect the times of occurrence of\n the two processes; however, as tide is totally \nindependent of storm occurrence and resulting stor\nm surge, reasonable and valid estimates can be \nmade by treating the statistics of each process as independent.  In this case, the combined \n\nprobability is simply the \nproduct of the probability \nof high tide during the time\n period of interest and \nthe probability of the Designated Storm. \nGuidance for defining appropriate combinations of \nstorm surge is provided below in Section 3.2.5. \n', ' Rev: 0 \nDate: 27 January 2011 \n\nProject No:  143111:  BC\n Ministry of Environment\n /Climate Change Adaption Guidelines for Sea Dikes and Coastal Flood Hazard Land Use 7 \nTable 3-1: Tidal Ranges for General Regions \nSource: Canadian Tide and Current Tables Œ Volumes 5, 6 and 7 (2010) \nTide \nParameter \nWest Coast \nVancouver \nIsland \nJuan de Fuca \nStrait Georgia Strait Central Coast Northern BC \nMeters with respect to CGD \nHHWLT 2.0 1.5 2.0 2.7 4.2 \nHHWMT 1.3 0.6 1.3 1.7 2.9 \nMWL 0 0 0 0 0 \nLLWMT -1.5 -1.0 \n-1.9 -1.0 -2.1 \nLLWLT -2.2 -1.9 \n-3.1 -2.9 -3.4 \nData for General Regions based on: \nWest Coast Vancouver Island: Tofino  paramet\ners can vary up to ± 0.3 m along the coast \nJuan de Fuca Strait:  Victoria  parameter\ns can vary up to ± 0.4 m along the strait \nGeorgia Strait:  Point Atkinson parameters \ncan vary up to ± 0.4 m over the strait \nCentral Coast:  Bella Bella parameters can vary up to ± 1.0 m along the coast \nNorthern BC:  Prince Rupert parameters can vary up to ± 2.5 m along the coast \nNote:   - Tide parameters on the west coast of\n the Queen Charlotte Islands (Haida Gwaii) are more similar to the \nCentral Coast than to Northern BC. \n- Ranges based on MWL as published by CHS \n 0.0 m CGD  3.2.5 Meteorological Water Level Effects \nSea levels along coastal British Columbia are al\nso affected by meteorological and oceanographic \nconditions specific to the area that result in di\nfferences between the predictable astronomical tides \n(Section 3.2.4) and the actual water level \nat a given time.  These conditions include: \n Sea level change due to changes in atmospheric pressure. \n Sea level change due to the effects of strong winds blowing over the water surface. \n Sea level change due to wave momentum effects in shallow water \n Sea level change due to changes in ocean currents or temperature. \nThe integrated effect of these forcing mechanism\ns can be seen in measured water level data by \nremoving the predicted astronomical tide, which then \ndefines a residual water level that reflects all \nof the forcing mechanisms outlined above. \nIn coastal British Columbia waters, the characteri\nstics of residual water levels can be defined with \nthe assistance of the long term \nmeasured water level records available from several long term CHS \ntide recording stations along the coast.  Long records of recorded total water levels are available at \n\nthe stations summarized in Table 3-2. \n', ' Rev: 0 \nDate: 27 January 2011 \n\nProject No:  143111:  BC\n Ministry of Environment\n /Climate Change Adaption Guidelines for Sea Dikes and Coastal Flood Hazard Land Use 8 \nTable 3-2:  Summary of Long-Te\nrm Tidal Stations in BC \nRegion Station \nCHS Station ID Years of \nCoverage \nComments \nWest Coast Tofino 8615 1909 - present \nGaps between 1920 and \n1940 \nWest Coast Bamfield 8545 1969 Œ present _ \nJuan de \nFuca Strait Victoria 7120 1909 Œ present \nGaps between 1914 and \n1950 \nGeorgia \nStrait Point Atkinson \n7795 1914 Œ present \nGaps between 1923 and \n1927 and 1939 - 1944 \n Northern Georgia \nStrait Campbell \nRiver \n8074 1958 Œ present \nGaps between 1958 and \n1972 \nCentral \nCoast \nBella Bella 8976 1906 Œ present \nGaps between 1907 and \n1962 \nNorthern BC \nPrince Rupert \n9354 1909 Œ present \nGaps between 1928 and \n1939 \nHaida Gwai \nQueen Charlotte \nCity \n9850 1957 Œ present Gaps between 1959 - 1964 \nA preliminary review and evaluation of the residual\n water levels resulting from these stations is \nprovided in the support materials provided in Appendix D. \nRegional Meteorological Effects \nA preliminary review of the residual water levels\n achieved at each station (Appendix D) indicates \nthat the general characteristics of residual water \nlevels can be summarized on a regional basis as \nfollows: \n West Coast Vancouver Island Œ Juan de Fuca Strait and Georgia Strait:  Tofino \n Central Coast Œ Queen Charlotte Islands Œ North Coast:    Prince Rupert \nThe larger residual water levels recorded at the Tofino and Prince Rupert tide gauge locations are \nshown in Figure 3-2, which shows the peak water level after the predicted tide is removed.  For \nclarity the only events shown are those over a thre\nshold chosen so that at least one event is \npresent for every year of record.  A review of t\nhe higher events from each data set confirmed that \nthe events were not spikes, with limited (one or \ntwo hours) duration above th\ne threshold, and that \nthey correspond to known severe storms on the coast. \nA preliminary extreme value analysis of the avail\nable data sets at Tofino and Prince Rupert, using a \nPeak over Threshold extreme value methodology, a\nfter ensuring that at least 72 hours exists \nbetween each event, and after considering the effect of various threshold values, gives the \n\nestimates of expected residual water levels for a range of annual exceedance probabilities (or \nreturn periods) summarized in Table 3-3. \nA comparison of inter-station residual time se\nries during large events indicates that the peak \nresidual values vary approximately ± 0.1 m among \nthe stations within the two groups indicated \nabove. \nReference is also made to section 8.2.4, item \n2 of the Draft Policy Discussion Paper - Climate \nChange Adaptation Guidelines for Sea Dikes  and Coastal Flood Hazard Land Use in BC.

For most sea dikes, with \ntheir seaward face situated at \nor above normal high tide elevations, the design wave climate will \ngenerally be controlled by the depth of water a short di\nstance seaward of the t\noe.  Specification of \nthe appropriate location to define the design wa\nve climate is generally unique to the design \nmethodology being used for a specific component of the dike.   \nReference must be made to the specific requirements in the Reference Publications. \nLocal Wave Climate at the Dike \nAs a preliminary guideline, the maximum seastate\n7 that can exist in a given depth of shallow water \ncan be estimated using the procedures outlined in\n CIRIA; CUR; CETMEF (2007) or US Army \nCorps of Engineering (2002). \nThe seastate that can exist at a sea dike depends \nstrongly on the water depth at the toe of the sea \ndike, the slope of the foreshore in front of the \nsea dike and in some cases on the seaward slope of \nthe sea dike itself. As guidance, the maximum seastate (H\ns) 7 may be between approximately 0.5 \nand 1.2 times the depth of water.  In general, an \niterative procedure will be required during design \nto define the seastate. \nIt will also be necessary to check \nthat the seastate at the toe of \nthe dike is consistent with the \nDesignated Storm for the annual exceedance probab\nility specified for the sea dike planning or \ndesign process. \nThe details of the design seastate that are requi\nred for planning or design can be defined using the \nprocedures outlined in EA, ENW, KFKI (2007) \nor specifically in Ba\nttjes, et al. (2000). \n3.2.7 Scour \nWaves and currents may cause scour to occur on the seabed adjacent to a sea dike.  The scour \ndepth that may occur either during the design life \nof the sea dike or during the Designated Storm \nshould be considered and either allowed for in defining the necessary sea dike crest elevation or \nscour protection should be provided as necessary. \n                                                     \n 7 The term ﬁseastateﬂ is used in this document\n to encapsulate, in a general way, all of the \nparameters and characteristics t\nhat may be needed during design to define the waves at a given \ninstant in time.  The sea state is the general condi\ntion of the free surface of a body of waterŠwith \nrespect to wind waves and swellŠat a certain loca\ntion and moment. The sea state is characterized \nby statistics, including wave height(s), period(s\n), distribution and power spectrum.

As a minimum, it is recommended that the pr\nesent freeboard allowance of 0.6 m should be \nincluded in sea dike design, above and beyond any sp\necific allowances adopted to deal with the \nknown uncertainties for the area in question.  T\nhese known uncertainties s\nhould be explicitly stated \nduring design. \n ', ' Rev: 0 \nDate: 27 January 2011 \n\nProject No:  143111:  BC\n Ministry of Environment\n /Climate Change Adaption Guidelines for Sea Dikes and Coastal Flood Hazard Land Use 12 \n4 Sea Dike Design \n4.1.1 Crest Elevation \nGeneral \nThe crest elevation of a sea dike shall be establ\nished to provide the protection required during the \nDesignated Storm.  \nThe Sea Dike Crest Elevation can be defined based on the following: \nDesignated Flood Level + Wave Run-up + Freeboard \n  or: Designated Flood Level + Acceptable Crest Height \n where: Wave Run-up\n = vertical distance above the mean water level exceeded, by no more than 2% of \nthe waves at the toe of the sea dike \nAcceptable Crest Height\n = vertical distance above the mean water level required to keep any \nwave overtopping below the chosen criteria for \nacceptable rates of overtopping, as summarized \nbelow in Table 4-1 or Table 4-2. \nAlternatively an Acceptable Crest Height can be \ndefined based on the results of a Quantitative Risk \nAnalysis (QRA) process that identifies an acc\neptable amount of inundation during the Designated \nStorm. In general, a Sea Dike Crest Elevation is establishe\nd so that any overtopping that occurs during the \nDesignated Storm is within limits set to ensure t\nhat inundation behind the dike during the storm is \nacceptable, that it is within the limits considered\n during the design of the dike armour components, \non the seaward and landward faces, and on the sea di\nke crest, and that it is consistent with any \nrequirement for personnel to be present on \nthe dike during the Designated Storm Event. \nThe total quantity of overtopping during the Designat\ned Storm should be defined to ensure that it is \nconsistent with the FCL defined for inundation behind a Sea Dike.\n Overtopping of a sea dike can take two main forms. \n If wave runup is high enough, relative to the \ncrest elevation of the dike, water can pass over th\ne dike as a nearly continuous sheet or plume of \nwater.  In the second case, as waves break against the seaward face, a mixture of air and water \n\ndroplets Œ spray Œ can be carried over the dike, either\n by the momentum of the breaking wave or by \nthe added effect of entrainment into the onshore wi\nnds. Over time, if left undrained, the volume of \nwater contained in the spray can accumulate and result in flooding (inundation) behind the dike. \nIn general, it is usually uneconomic to design a sea dike with a crest elevation high enough to \nprevent all overtopping.  In many\n cases, other factors, including \navailable land, existing land uses, \nsoil conditions, access, visibility over the dike \nor habitat issues may limit the sea dike crest \nelevation. \nGuidance on acceptable limits for overtopping is av\nailable in the Reference Publications.  As initial \nguidance, the average or mean overtopping dischar\nges summarized below in Table 4-1 and Table \n4-2 can be used. The criteria in Table 4-1 apply to a conventional sea dike with gentle seaward \nslopes.  The criteria in Table 4-2 can be used to estimate the crest elevation required for a vertical \nseawall that starts at or near the high tide elevation. \n', ' Rev: 0 \nDate: 27 January 2011 \n\nProject No:  143111:  BC\n Ministry of Environment\n /Climate Change Adaption Guidelines for Sea Dikes and Coastal Flood Hazard Land Use 13 \nIt should be noted that these criteria do not cover a\nll possible configurations\n of sea dikes, or all \nissues that may be pertinent, and detailed engineering \ninvestigations may be required in specific \ncases. \nTable 4-1: Available Criteria for Acceptable Rates of Overtopping at a Sea Dike \nHazard and Reason \nMean Discharge \nliters/s/m source \nNo damage if sea dike crest or \nrear slope is well protected \n50 - 200 \nEA, ENW, KFKI (2007) \nNo damage if sea dike crest or \nrear slope is a grass covered clay \nembankment \n1-10 \nEA, ENW, KFKI (2007) \nNo damage if sea dike crest or \nrear slope is not protected \n0.1 \nEA, ENW, KFKI (2007) \nNote: \nThe mean discharge (q) is defined at the crest of the sea dike. \n Table 4-2:  Available Criteria for Acceptable\n Rates of Overtopping at a Vertical Seawall \nHazard and Reason \nMean Discharge \nliters/s/m source \nNo damage expected to building \nstructural elements for a building \nlocated behind the seawall. \n(q is defined at the building) \n1 EA, ENW, KFKI (2007) \nNo damage to Equipment set back \n5 Œ 10 m from edge of seawall \ncrest.

It was found that erosion damage star\nted on the ﬁunprotectedﬂ dike at an overtopping \nrate of 0.1 liters/s/m.

Along a dike of approximately 1000 m length, a limit\n of 10 liters/s/m implies that during a six hour \nstorm the total volume of water overtopping the sea dike could amount to: \n10 liters/s/m x 1000 m x 6 h x 3600 sec/hr = 216 million liters = 216,000 m\n3 This volume of water will amount to approximat\nely 2 m of standing water over a land area of 10 \nhectares, unless it can be drained away. \nIn the case of the criteria in Table 4-2, it mu\nst be noted that reliable guidance does not exist to \ndefine the effect of distance on the decay rate \nof overtopping and therefore it may not be clear how \nfar behind a given dike or seawall a building must \nbe to satisfy the 1 liter/m/s threshold.  Site \nspecific engineering investigations\n are warranted in many situations. \nSpecification of a suitable Sea Di\nke Crest Elevation will generally \nbe an iterative process as the \nvolume of overtopping for a given Designated Stor\nm will be significantly influenced by the design of \nthe seaward face of the sea dike.  Acceptable quan\ntities of overtopping may also be significantly \ninfluenced by the design of the landward face of t\nhe sea dike, especially if space or land use does \nnot permit the 1:3 (V:H) landward slope implied by\n the criteria in Table 4-1.

It is defined either as a number between 0 and \n1 or as a corresponding percentage. \nAn AEP of 0.01 means there is a 1% chance of\n an event, of a giv\nen magnitude or larger, \noccurring in any single given year. An AEP of 0.\n01 or 1/100 yr also sugg\nests that on average, \nunder certain conditions, the Average Return Peri\nod, or interval between recurrences of this \nevent, is approximately 100 years.  \n1.2 Average Return Period \nOver a long period of time, the average number \nof years between occurrences of a particular \nevent.

Where \nthe flow of a large watercourse is controlled \nby a major dam, the designated flood shall be set \non a site-specific basis. \nIn coastal areas, the existing definition of a \nDesignated Flood is not appropriate as the \nprobability of flooding from the sea is the result\n of the joint occurrence of tide and a storm \ncrossing the coastal waters of British Columbia a\nnd at some time in the future, sea level rise \ndue to climate change.  \nIn estuaries, where a river discharges into \nthe sea, the definition \nof the Designated Flood \napplies to the river. \nIn these documents the definition ﬁDesignated Floodﬂ is replaced with the term ﬁDesignated \nStormﬂ as defined below. \n1.4 Designated Flood Level (DFL) \nThe observed or calculated elevation for the \nDesignated Flood and is used in the calculation \nof the Flood Construction Level. \nIn coastal areas, the Designated Flood Level (DFL) includes the appropriate allowance for \nfuture sea level rise, tide and the total st\norm surge expected during the designated storm. \n1.5 Designated Storm (DS) \nA storm, which may occur in any given year, of\n such a magnitude as to equal a storm having \nthe designated annual exc\needence probability (AEP).  The Designated Storm has several phenomena asso\nciated with it that will define components \nof the Designated Flood Level, including st\norm surge, wind set-up, wave run-up and \novertopping for the storm.  These include: \n A time series of atmospheric pressure durin\ng the passage of the storm over the area in \nquestion \n A time series of wind speed and direction dur\ning the passage of the storm over the area \nin question  A time series of wave conditions, including wave heights, periods and directions during \nthe passage of the storm in question.\n 1.6 Diking Authority \n(a) The commissioners of a district to which Part 2 of the Drainage, Ditch and Dike Act\n applies, \n(b) A person owning or controlling a dike other than a private dike, \n(b1)\n If the final agreement of a treaty first nation so \nprovides, the treaty first nation in relation \nto dikes on its treaty lands, \n', ' Appendix A \n3 (c) A public authority designated by the minister \nas having any responsibility for maintenance \nof a dike other than a private dike, or \n(d) A regional district, a municipality or an improvement district. \n1.7 Flood Construction Level (FCL) \nUses the Designated Flood Level plus an allowa\nnce for Freeboard to establish the elevation \nof the underside of a wooden floor system or t\nop of concrete slab for habitable buildings. In \nthe case of a manufactured home, the ground le\nvel or top of concrete or asphalt pad, on \nwhich it is located, shall be equal to or hig\nher than the above described elevation. It also \nestablishes the minimum crest level of a Standard Dike. Where the Designated Flood Level \n\ncannot be determined or where there are overri\nding factors, an assessed height above the \nnatural boundary of the water-body or above th\ne natural ground elevation may be used (as \ndefined in the Land Use Guidelines 2004).  \nIn coastal areas the FCL does not relate to the crest level of a sea dike, nor does it relate to \nthe crest level of flood proofing fill exposed dire\nctly to the designated flood level.  The FCL \ndoes; however, include wave Œ structure interact\nion effects, to be determined at the location \nof the site of the building. \n1.8 Flood Construction Reference Plane (FCRP) \nThe vertical elevation of an estimated future Natural Boundary from which the FCL is \ndetermined. \n1.9 Flood Plain \nA lowland area, whether diked, fl\nood proofed, or not, which, by reasons of land elevation, is \nsusceptible to flooding from an adjoining watercourse, ocean, lake or other body of water and \nfor administration purposes is taken to be \nthat area submerged at the Designated Flood \nLevel. In coastal areas the concept of the Flood Plain has been extended to a ﬁSea Level Rise \nPlanning Areaﬂ; defined below.  Special meas\nures may be warranted in this area. \n1.10 Flood Proofing \nThe alteration of land or structures either \nphysically or in use to reduce flood damage and \nincludes the use of building setbacks from water bodies to maintain a floodway and allow for \n\npotential erosion. Flood Proofing may be achieved by all or a combination of the following: \n Building on fill, provided such \nfill does not interfere with fl\nood flows of the watercourse, \nand is adequately protected against floodwater erosion \n Building raised by structural means such as foundation walls, columns, etc. \n A combination of fill and structural means.\n In coastal areas exposed to flooding, constr\nuction of fill as a flood proofing measure may \nsubstantially increase t\nhe freeboard required to def\nine the FCL, if the fill \nis directly exposed to \nthe Designated Flood Level. In this case, the FC\nL must be equivalent to the crest level of a \nsea dike with the same characteristic\ns as the seaward face of the fill.. 1.11 Freeboard  \nA vertical distance added to the Designated Flood Level. Used to establish the Flood \nConstruction Level.   \n', ' Appendix A \n4 In coastal areas, the vertical distance to be added to a Designated Flood Level is site and \nstructure specific. \n1.12 Natural Boundary \nMeans the visible high watermark of any lake, rive\nr, stream or other body of water where the \npresence and action of the water are so common and usual and so long continued in all \nordinary years as to mark upon the soil of the bed \nof the lake, river, stream or other body of \nwater a character distinct from that of the banks \nthereof, in respect to vegetation, as well as in \nrespect to the nature of the soil itself (Land Act, Section 1).  In addition, the natural boundary \nincludes the best estimate of the edge of dorm\nant or old side channels and marsh areas.  For \ncoastal areas, the natural boundary shall incl\nude the natural limit of permanent terrestrial \nvegetation.  \nNatural Boundary is an established concept in \nBC law Œ and reflects a change in vegetation \nand soil based on effects of the sea. In the\n Flood Hazard Area Land Use Guidelines 2004,\n building setbacks were established from Natural Boundary, on the unstated assumption that \nthe location of Natural Boundary is relatively \nstatic (other than erosions and accretions).  \nNatural boundary is, in practice, often difficult to\n determine in the field or from remote survey. \nIn coastal areas, the Natural Boundary reflects \na snapshot historical record of tide, storm \nsurge and wave runup effects, which may be the ma\nrk of a recent storm in an ordinary year or \nit may be the mark of the most severe storm in \nrecent times.  There is no way of knowing for \ncertain.  A technical basis for the Natural Boundary\n in coastal areas is site and time specific.  \nIn the future the location and elevation of a Natural Boundary will change from time to time \ndue to changes associated with sea level rise and it will likely lag sea level rise.  It is also \nunlikely to immediately reflect the action of t\nhe water, especially the storm surge and waves, \nduring a Designated Storm. \n1.13 Project Life \nThe number of years a particular project; incl\nuding a sea dike, a building or a community, is \nintended to serve before it is replaced, upgra\nded or dismantled.  Regular maintenance to \nensure the project provides the intended pur\npose is expected during the project life. \n1.14 Sea Dike \nA dike, floodwall or any other thing that prevents \nflooding of land by the sea. As defined in the \nDike Maintenance Act, ﬁdikeﬂ means ﬁan embankment, wall, fill, piling, pump, gate, flood box, \npipe, sluice, culvert, canal, ditch, drainﬂ. \n1.15 Sea Dike Crest Elevation \nSea Dike Crest Elevation has es\nsentially the same meaning as ﬁ\ndike crest height\nﬂ in the \nexisting document ﬁ\nDike Design and Construction Guide 2003\nﬂ. However, the existing \ndefinition of dike height suggest\ns that consideration of wave run-up and set-up is optional. \nThe term Sea Dike Crest Elevation is defined to specifically cover scenarios where wave run-\nup, overtopping and wind and wave setup must be in\ncluded in defining the height of the dike. \n1.16 Sea Dike System \nA system of: dikes, dunes, berms or natural sh\norelines that provide a similar function; and \nassociated engineering works (e.g., tidal gates, outfalls, outlet structures, seawalls, quay \nwalls, ramps, adjacent building \nfeatures, etc.) used to protect \nland from flooding or inundation. \nIn the Netherlands where dike \nsystems are highly evolved, a dike system is termed a ﬁdike \nringﬂ that forms the flooding defence for a region.\n  There are approximately 95 such rings in \n', ' Appendix A \n5 the Netherlands and each ring is the responsib\nility of a separate organizational entity, subject \nto national overview. \nIn BC, multiple Diking Authorities may share \nresponsibility for the sa\nme sea dike system. \n1.17 Sea Level Rise (SLR) \nAn allowance for increases in the mean elevati\non of the ocean associated with future climate \nchange, including any regional effects su\nch as crustal subsidence or uplift.  1.18 Sea Level Rise Planning Area (SLR Planning Area) \nAn area of land that may be subject to future flooding due to Sea Level Rise. This area \ndefines a future coastal flood plain.  The SLR Planning Area extends from the existing Natural \n\nBoundary landward to the highest predicted point\n of potential flooding related to SLR plus \nflooding expected from the combination of high tide, total storm surge and expected wave \nrunup during the Designated Storm. \nPredictions of SLR for the SLR Planning Area definition shall use best predictions for \nminimum periods of 90-100 years and 200 years forward. From time to time, both the Natural \nBoundary and the predictions for SLR are subjec\nt to change, and theref\nore the extent of a \nSLR Planning Area may be revised at regular intervals in the future. \n1.19 Seastate \nThe term ﬁseastateﬂ is used to encapsulate, \nin a general way, all of the parameters and \ncharacteristics that may be needed during design\n to define the waves at a given instant in \ntime.  The sea state is the general condition of\n the free surface of a body of waterŠwith \nrespect to wind waves and swellŠat a certain location and moment. The sea state is \ncharacterized by statistics, including wave height(s), period(s), distribution and power \nspectrum. The sea state varies with time, as\n the weather or oceanogr\naphic factors change.  \nFor engineering purposes the seastate is often \ncharacterized by the significant wave height, \nHs. 1.20 Setback  \nMeans withdrawal or siting of a building or \nlandfill away from the natural boundary or other \nreference line to maintain a floodway and to allow for potential land erosion.   \n1.21 Standard Dikes \nDikes built to a minimum crest elevation equal to the Flood Construction Level and meeting \nstandards of design and construction approved by the Ministry of Environment and \nmaintained by an ongoing authority such as a local government body. \n1.22 Storm Surge  \nA change in water level caused by the action of\n wind and atmospheric pressure variation on \nthe sea surface. The typical effect is to \nraise the level of the sea above the predicted \nastronomical tide level, although in some situations, such as when winds blow offshore, the \nactual water level may be lower than that predicted. The magnitude of a storm surge on the \nBC coast will be dependent on the severity \nand duration of the stor\nm event in the North \nPacific, its track relative to the BC \ncoast and the seabed bathymetry at the site. \n1.23 Total Storm Surge \nThe combination of the storm surge generated in\n deep water plus the additional local surge or \nwind setup generated by the effe\nct of the winds during the De\nsignated Storm over shallow \n', ' Appendix A \n6 water at a particular site.  In general the deep water storm surge is nearly the same as that \nrecorded at a tidal gauging station.  Additional \nsurge may occur at other sites.  For planning \npurpose, winds during a Designated Storm will st\nart to generate local surge in water depths \nless than 30 m. \n1.24 Wave Run-up \nThe vertical distance that waves run-up the seaw\nard slope of a structure \nor a shoreline.  The \nvertical distance is measured from the mean water level, which is the same as the \nDesignated Flood Level. \nFor coastal flooding hazard management the Wave Run-up is taken as 50 per cent of the \ncalculated run-up elevation on the natural shoreline.

Simplifying assumptions have \nbeen made in the development of these examples, \nespecially with regard to design criteria, solely for the purpose of developing examples.  A detailed \nplanning or design process will need to undertake \nsite specific investigations to develop the \nappropriate design criteria.  The examples illust\nrated in this section also do not consider \nenvironmental or land-use issues and the dike f\nootprints shown in these examples do not reflect \nany consideration of these important issues.  No \nconsideration is given to the stages of design, \napproval or construction that \nmight be necessary to implement these examples nor do the \nexamples reflect any consideration of alternat\ne designs that might be suitable based on detailed \nsite specific requirements or design. \n1.2 Boundary Bay Sea Dike \n1.2.1 Location \nThe existing Boundary Bay sea dike is located \nalong the south boundary of the Corporation of \nDelta (Delta) and the north shore of Boundary Ba\ny, Figure 1-1.  The dike, which runs from \napproximately 17A Ave. in Tsawwassen to the boundary\n with Surrey in the \neast, generally protects \nlow lying agricultural land.  The protected area\n also includes the Boundary Bay airport and the \nDelta Heritage Airport.  \nThe dike is directly exposed to long-term sea le\nvel rise, tides, storm surge and to the local wind \nsetup and the wave climate generated by SE through SW winds associated with severe storms in \nthe south end of the Strait of Georgia and across\n Boundary Bay, Figure 1-2.  The maximum direct \nexposure is due S across to Orcas Island in t\nhe US Gulf Islands; however, wave generation may \noccur over the open water extending SE towards Rosa\nrio Strait, located east of Orcas Island.  The \nmaximum available fetch is limited to approximately 45 km. \nThe seaward slope of the existing dike is armour\ned with a conventional armour stone protection \nsystem.  A gravel road (with some paved sectio\nns) is located on the crest, Figure 1-3 and Figure \n1-4.  The landward slope is planted with grass, Figure 1-5. \nThe existing dike cross-section in the vicinity\n of this example is shown in Figure 1-6. \n Land elevations in the area behind the dike are re\nported to be subsiding at a rate of approximately \n1-2 mm/year.  Typical present (2010) land elevatio\nns behind the dike are approximately 1.5 to 1.8 \nm CGD. \nThe net expected (including land subsidence) regional\n sea level rise by 2100 for this area is 1.2 m. \n', ' Appendix C \n2  Figure 1-1:  Location of B\noundary Bay Sea Dike Example \nsource CHS Chart 3001 Œ Not for Navigation\n  Figure 1-2: View from Existing Dike Looking S (mid-tide) \nDike toe in foreground Œ Orcas Island in background to the right.\n ', ' Appendix C \n3  Figure 1-3: View Looking W along Seaward Face of Dike \n Figure 1-4: View looking W along Existing Dike Crest \n', ' Appendix C \n4  Figure 1-5: View Looking W at Lands behind Dike \nSeaSideLand\nSide\n20 m 10 m \n0-10 m \nEl.\n3.8m0mEl.\n4.0m~3~1 Figure 1-6:  Typical Cross-Section of Existing Dike \nsource: Corporation of Delta Engineering \nelevations: CGD \n ', ' Appendix C \n5 1.2.2 Assessment of Dike Design Guidelines Œ Boundary Bay Sea Dike \n1.2.2.1 Design Basis \n AEP for Designated Storm: 1/200 for 2010 (Exi\nsting Guidelines), \n1/500 for 2100 and 2200 \n(Updated Guidelines) \n Tides: Based on CHS Tide Tables, Vol 5,\n Secondary Port: 7579 Crescent Beach \n Designated Storm assumed to have storm force winds (\n 48 knots); depth limited waves at \ntoe of dike and peak winds, storm surge \nand seastate maxima occur simultaneously. \n Storm Surge during Designated Storm as per Table 3-3, this document. \n Wave set-up is included in the determination of Wave Runup. \n Cross section slope and armour details are taken to be the same general type as on the \nexisting dike except that a 1:\n3 grass protected interior slope \nis implicitly assumed to be \npresent to conform with available acceptance \ncriteria for mean overtopping rates, Table 4-\n1, this document. \n Table 1-1: Summary of Sea Dike Crest Elevations \nBoundary Bay \nCASE \n2010 \nﬁexistingﬂ \nGuideline \n2100 \nﬁ updatedﬂ \nGuideline \n2200 \nﬁupdatedﬂ \nGuideline \nReference vertical plane \nCGD = MWL = +2.8 m CD \nElevation of Toe of Sea Dike \n+1.6 m CGD Regional SLR (m, wrt MWL) \n0  1.2  2.4  Reference Tide level  (HHWLT) (m) \n+1.8  +1.8  +1.8  Storm Surge AEP \n1/200 \n1/500 \n1/500 \nStorm surge height (m) 1.25  1.3 \n1.3 \nLocal wind set up (m) \n0.4 \n0.5 \n0.5 \nDesignated Flood Level (m, CGD) \n3.45 \n4.8 \n6.0 \nWave Runup (R 2%) m \n1.4 \n2.6 \n3.6 \nRunup elevation for ﬁgreenﬂ water alone (m, CGD) \n4.9 \n7.4  9.6  Crest Elevation for 10 L/s/m (m, CGD) \n4.4  6.9  9.3  Crest Elevation for 1 L/s/m (m, CGD) \n5.0  7.8  10.5  Freeboard (m) \n+0.6 \n+0.6 \n+0.6 \nComment: \nThe values in the Table above Designated Flood Level \nare site specific and those s\nhown are guideline values for \nthese examples.

The sea dike is one part \nof the dike system that surrounds Richmond. \nThe dike is directly exposed to sea level rise, stor\nm surges and only indirectly to the wave climate \nin the Strait of Georgia as some protection is prov\nided by the extensive inte\nr-tidal flats of Sturgeon \nBank, by the jetties located on the main and north ar\nms of the Fraser River and by the Iona jetty.  \nThis site is most exposed to severe NW winds that follow in the wake of severe storm systems; \n\nhowever at a detailed stage of ev\naluation, consideration about the present and future degree of \nprotection against SE and S winds provided by\n the Steveston Jetty will be required. \nThe seaward slope of the existing dike consists of\n a grass covered 1:5 slope with a steep grass \ncovered landside slope leading to a drainage channel, Figure 1-9 and Figure 1-10.

At present, the area is not \ndiked and flooding has not been experienced during \nstorms on the existing grade slab, which has an el\nevation of approximately + 4 m CGD.  As sea \nlevel rises over the next century, the area will be\ncome exposed to an increasing risk of flooding and \nmeasures will need to be taken to adapt to the risk. \n If protection of the existing land-use is adopted \nas the option, a sea dike will be required. \nFor the purpose of this example \nthe west end of Granv\nille Island, which is \npartially exposed to \nEnglish Bay, Figure 1-15 and Figure 1-16, is considered. \nLand elevations in the area are reported to\n be stable, neither rising nor subsiding. \nThe net expected (including land subsidence) regional\n sea level rise by 2100 for this area is 1.0 m. \n   Figure 1-14:  Location of Gran\nville Island Sea Dike Example \nsource CHS Chart 3001 Œ Not for Navigation \n', ' Appendix C \n13 \n Figure 1-15:  View Looking NW from Granville Island showing Exposure to English Bay \n Figure 1-16:  View Showing Exposed NW Corner of Granville Island \n', ' Appendix C \n14 \n1.4.1 Assessment of Dike Design Guidelines Œ Granville Island \n1.4.1.1 Design Basis \n AEP for Designated Storm: 1/200 for 2010 (Exi\nsting Guidelines), \n1/500 for 2100 and 2200 \n(Updated Guidelines) \n Tides: Based on CHS Tide Tables, Vol \n5, Secondary Port: 7710 False Creek \n Designated Storm assumed to have storm force winds (\n 48 knots); the maximum seastate \npresent at the wall is taken to be 0.6 m and storm surge and seastate maxima occur \nsimultaneously. \n Storm Surge during Designated Storm as per Table 3-3, this document. \n Wave set-up is included in the determination of Wave Runup. \n A near vertical seawall was adopted for the s\nea dike in this example due to the close \nproximity of highly used public buildings near \nthe edge of the existing island slope.

Further investigations are warranted as noted in each case. \n2 Atmospheric Sea Level Ri\nse in BC Coastal Waters  \n2.1 Introduction \nSea levels along the coastal British Columbia co\nast are strongly affected by the mid-latitude \nstorm systems in the North Paci\nfic.  The strong winds and low atmospheric pressures in the \nstorms result in a large, though low in amplitude, surge wave that affects considerable \nportions of the Northwest North American coastline at the same time. \nA detailed discussion of all aspects of thes\ne storm systems is beyond the scope of this \ndocument; however a brief discussion is provi\nded as background to the definition of storm \nsurge used in this document. \nIn particular, the connection between the offs\nhore character of the storms and the resulting \nstorm surge is discussed.  As an example, \nthe storm of 12 March Œ \n15 March, 2010 is shown \nbelow.  This storm entered the Gulf of Alaska ne\nar the southern tip of the Aleutian Islands on \n12 March 2010, moving in a generally easterly direction along the 50\nth parallel of latitude, \nFigure 2-1. \nThe evolution of the storm over\n the period up to 15 March 2010 is shown in Figure 2-2, by \nwhich time hurricane force winds were expected in\n the Hecate Strait area of coastal British \nColumbia.  This storm generated gale to storm \nforce winds throughout much of the Gulf of \nAlaska. \nThe surface effect of the storm winds on 12 Ma\nrch can be seen in Figure 2-3, where the red \nshading centred approximately on the 53\nrd parallel of latitude corresponds to a surge, above \ntide, of approximately 0.6 m.  This large area \nof surge is being setup by the combination of \nthe inverse barometer affect due to the low atmos\npheric pressure and to the effect of the gale \nto storm force winds circulating around the low pressure centre. \nIn this particular case, th\ne storm crossed the North American coastline north of Dixon \nEntrance and the surge mainly affected Alaska state coastal waters.  A track south of the 50\nth parallel would have brought the deepwater surge di\nrectly onto the British Columbia coast. The \nlength of coastline affected by the storm surge for \na storm of this severity is clearly as long or \neven longer than the west coast of British Columbia. \n \n ', ' Appendix D \n2  Figure 2-1:  Mid-Latitude Extra-Tropical Storm of Mid-March 2010 \nNote: central pressure = 966 mb \n', ' Appendix D \n3  Figure 2-2:  Evolution of Storm 12 March Œ 15 March 2010 \n  Figure 2-3:  Storm Driven Surge in Gulf Alaska \nsource: BC Storm Surge Model - \nhttp://www.pac.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/sci/juandefuca/npac_lr\n 2.2 Expected Coastal Deepwater Storm Surges for BC \nExamination of the surges recorded along the BC \ncoastline has shown that in many, if not in \nmost cases, the deepwater surge generated in \nthe North Pacific, after modification over the \ncontinental shelf, arrives relatively unchanged at \nall stations in the general north coast or \nsouth coast areas of British Columbia.  An ex\nample of the storm surges recorded on the coast \nfor a storm on 9 Œ 16 December 1995, is shown in Figure 2-4 and illustrates how the surge \n\nwave retains its main characteristics all the way from its arrival on the west coast of \n', ' Appendix D \n4 Vancouver Island (as recorded at Tofino), its pa\nssage up Juan de Fuca Strait (as recorded at \nVictoria and then into the Strait of Georgia (as \nrecorded at Point Atkinson).  The peak of the \nsurge, at approximately 22:00 hr on 12 Decemb\ner at Point Atkinson, occurred 5 hours earlier \nat Tofino and only increased in magnitude by approximately 0.1 m.  The peak of the surge, \nwhich is at least 6 hours long (within a 0.1 m tolerance), coincided with a peak in the gale \nforce SE winds that characterised this particular storm.  \nAs part of this assignment, the self-similar char\nacteristics of the incident surge wave from the \nNorth Pacific were examined for multiple storms\n and the trend exhibited in Figure 2-4 is \ntypical.  On the basis of these trends t\nhe expected magnitudes for the incident deepwater \nstorm surge were grouped and characterized as described in this report.  \n -10102-Dec-95\n09-Dec-95\n16-Dec-95\nResidual Water Level (m, wrt tide)\ntime (pst)\nVictoria res WL\nTofino res WL\nPt Atkinson res WL\n 2.3 Local Storm Surge \nThe incident deepwater storm surge, as illustrated \nin Figure 2-4, will be further modified as it \npropagates over shallow water, especially across \nthe extensive tidal flats in the Fraser River \nDelta.  Methods for estimating the addition\nal effects are provided in the Reference \nPublications. \n Figure 2-4: Storm Residual Water Level, 9 Œ 16 Dec 1995 \n', ' Appendix D \n5 2.4 Joint Occurrence of Storm Surge and Tide \nAn important element in the design of a sea dike is establishing the appropriate stage of \nastronomical tide, for combination with a storm surge, to be used for setting the total water \n\nlevel, and associated wind and wave related effects, for the Designated Flood Level. \nThis topic is an area of ongoing research and development and warrants additional \ninvestigations of its own.  \nFor the purpose of this documen\nt, which maintains the existing \nguidance in the \nDike Design and Construction Guide 2003\n, that combines the maximum \nhigh tide with the appropriate\n storm surge, the problem be\ncomes one of assigning an AEP to \nthe selection of the storm sur\nge (and the Designated Storm) that \nis consistent with the total \nwater level or Designated Flood Level. \nThe problem can be addressed by considering st\norms and the associated effects, including \nstorm surge, winds and waves, as processes th\nat are totally independent of the astronomical \ntides.  The combined probability, or alternativ\nely, the AEP of the comb\nined effects, becomes \nsimply the product of t\nhe probability of the storm and the pr\nobability of there being a high tide \npresent on the coast at the same time. \nThe simultaneous values of residual water le\nvels and the associated astronomical tides \nrecorded at Tofino are shown in Figure 2-5.  Th\nis data, which covers approximately 66 winter \nstorm periods during the total record shows that\n the combination of both a high tide (4.1 m) \nand a high storm surge (residual water level) is quite rare. \n  Figure 2-5:  Simultaneous Residual Water Levels and Predicted Tide Œ Tofino \nNote: MWL = 2.1 m (predicted tide) \n In simple terms, the probability of having a \nhigh tide during the winter storm season, which \ntypically spans 3 to 4 months (mid-October to \nmid-January), is related to the number of days \nin this period when a high tide is expected Œ sp\nring tides typically exist for approximately 3 \n', ' Appendix D \n6 days every 2 weeks and during those three days onl\ny exist for 2 to 3 hours (within a range of \napproximately ± 0.1 m) on \neach of the three days. \nThe probability of a high tide window is then approximately: \n3 days x 2 hours/window\n 14 days x 24 hours/day  \n  to  3 days x 3 hours/window\n 14 days x 24 hours/day  \n    or between  \n 1/56 to 1/37 \n \nAs the duration of the peak of \na storm surge is typically appr\noximately 6 hours long (within a \nrange of ± 0.1 m), or approximately twice the \nduration of the high tide \nthen the probability of \nhaving the peak of a storm surge at high ti\nde becomes 2/56 to 2/37 or 1/26 to 1/18.5.  \n For the purpose of this report we have take\nn the probability of a high tide window during the \noccurrence of a storm to be approximately 1/20.\n  On this basis the total AEP for high tide and \na typical winter storm (the annual aver\nage expected storm) becomes 1/20 x ½ \n 1/40.  By the \nsame reasoning the estimated AEP for the total \nwater level during the largest storm surge of \nrecord shown in Figure 2-5, occurring at MWL becomes approximately 1 x 1/300 \n 1/300. \n The AEP for high tide and a storm with an AEP \nof 1/200 years (the cu\nrrent guidance AEP) \nbecomes 1/20 x 1/200 \n 1/4000. \n The AEP for a storm that will yield a Desig\nnated Flood Level with\n an AEP of 1/10000 years \nbecomes 1/500, which is not significantly greater\n in actual effect than the current guidance in \nBritish Columbia. \n 2.5 Joint Occurrence of Storm Surge and Waves \nThe selection of a sea dike crest elevation that\n satisfies the chosen design criteria requires \nthe identification of the wave climate that is\n expected to occur during the Designated Storm.  \nPreliminary examination of the joint occurrence \nof recorded waves and residual water levels \n(storm surge) from two areas in coastal Brit\nish Columbia waters suggests that the largest \nwaves are not necessarily associated with the \nlargest storm surges, Figure 2-6 and Figure \n2-7. \nFor the purpose of this assignment it has been \nassumed for the sea dike examples, that the \nwave climate present at the sea dike is contro\nlled by the depth of water at the sea dike and \nthat the wave climate in deep water is suffici\nent to sustain the depth limited conditions.  \nFurther investigations are warranted for all \nareas of coastal British Columbia and will be \nrequired during more detailed engineering for sea dikes. \n', ' Appendix D \n7   Figure 2-6:  Simultaneous Residual Wa\nter Levels and Significant Wave Height \nResidual Water Level from Tofino Œ Waves from La Perouse Bank\n   Figure 2-7: Simultaneous Residual Water \nLevels and Significant Wave Height \nResidual Water Level from Point Atkinson Œ Waves from Halibut Bank \n ']
