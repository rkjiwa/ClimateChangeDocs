['CLIMATE CHANGE AND HEALTH\nClimate change is likely to impact most areas of our lives, including our health. In British Columbia, the principal hazards include rising temperatures, sea level rise, and increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. These hazards bring new and complex challenges, but by working together, we can increase \nour collective knowledge base and begin to think more strategically about how best to prepare to protect health. Population and community health are influenced by wider social, cultural, economic and environmental factors. These factors are commonly known as health determinants, and they are closely linked to a range of health outcomes. Increasingly, \nclimate change hazards are impacting health determinants. As illustrated in the figure, these impacts in turn influence and affect physical and mental health outcomes. ADDRESSING CLIMATE AND HEALTH RISKS IN BC\nFigure: Climate change hazards and their impacts on health determinants and health outcomesCLIMATE CHANGE \n HEALTH RISKS\nThe World Health Organization has identified climate change as the \nbiggest global health threat of the 21st century. Here in British Columbia, climate change is clearly observable and many people are already feeling its effects. With some degree of climate change now locked-in regardless of mitigation efforts, climate change adaptation is necessary \nto ensure British Columbia will fare well in the future. The challenge is significant, but British Columbia is well positioned to respond given strong capacity across different sectors. There are many specific actions that the larger health community can take to respond and prepare for climate change.  These actions often fall within the day-to-day responsibilities of the health care community and align with the sector™s overarching goal: improving health and well-being outcomes for all British Columbians.  \nHEALTH DETERMINANTS(Community and Individual)Climate Change Impacts Health OutcomesCommunity and IndividualLifestyle FactorsLivelihood FactorsCommunity and Social FactorsBuilt EnvironmentNatural EnvironmentCLIMATE \nCHANGE \nHAZARDSHEALTH \nOUTCOMESRisingtemperaturesExtreme weather Sea level rise$', 'CLIMATE CHANGE: BC HEALTH RISKS\nThe table outlines key health and community risks posed by climate change that have been observed in BC. \nVulnerable groups such as young children, the elderly, people with existing cardiopulmonary and respiratory \nillnesses, low-income families and people with mental wellness challenges are at greater risk.\nCLIMATE CHANGE HAZARDS\nPRIMARY IMPACTS\nHEALTH AND COMMUNITY RISKS\nSea level riseStorm surges  (temporary flooding) ·Stress, anxiety and trauma ·Food and water contamination and/or shortages ·Increased prevalence of water-borne pathogens and contaminants \n ·Interruption of health services ·Increased potential for mold growth ·Infrastructure/property damageFlooding  (long-term and permanent inundation) ·Stress, anxiety and trauma ·Food and water contamination and/or shortages ·Increased prevalence of water-borne pathogens and contaminants \n ·Population displacement ·Infrastructure/property damageRising temperaturesMore frequent, severe and prolonged heat waves and urban ﬁheat islandﬂ effects ·Decreased air quality due to heat (ground level ozone [smog]) ·Heat-related deaths ·Heat-related illnesses such as heat stroke and heat exhaustion ·Mental health impacts such as stress and anxiety  ·Health care facility impacts such as power outages, rising temperatures in facilities without air conditioning Changes in infectious agents, introduction of new pests, longer disease transmission seasons in some areas ·Possible increased incidence and/or prevalence of vector-borne \ninfectious diseases ·Introduction of new pests affecting food/crop production ·Possible emergence of new diseases and/or re-emergence of previously eradicated diseases Increased production of pollens and spores ·Increased allergies, intensification of symptoms ·Increased exposure to allergens due to longer allergy seasons Extreme weatherIncreased frequency and intensity of storms  ·Injury, death\n ·Stress, anxiety and trauma  ·Food and water contamination and/or shortages  ·Increased prevalence of water-borne pathogens and contaminants \n ·Interruption of health services ·Increased potential for mold growth ·Infrastructure/property damagesMore frequent, severe and prolonged drought ·Food and water contamination and/or shortages  ·Increased prevalence of water-borne pathogens and contaminants \n ·Stress, anxiety and traumaWildfires  ·Injury, death\n ·Stress, anxiety and trauma  ·Exacerbation of respiratory conditions such as asthma and emphysema due to poor air quality ·Interruption of health services ·Infrastructure/property damagesFRONTLINE HEALTH CARE\nHEALTH CARE FACILITIES\nCLIMATE CHANGE HEALTH RISKS\nPUBLIC HEALTH\nCOMMUNITIESThis backgrounder is part of a five-part series developed by the Ministry of Health and the Provincial Climate Action Secretariat that aims to help people working in community and public health to prepare for the current and future impacts of climate change.
