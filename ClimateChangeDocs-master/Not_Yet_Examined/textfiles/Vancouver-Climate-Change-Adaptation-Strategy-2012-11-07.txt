Some climate change is now inevitable and there is evidence \nthe world over that changes are already taking place. \nGlobal mitigation  e˚orts are underway to curb greenhouse gas emissions, but unless concerted \n action happens soon, further and more extreme changes may become  \n\nunavoidable. \nPreparing for these changes Œadapting to climate change Œ  \nis a warranted and complementary strategy. \nThe City of Vanc\nouver is a  \nrecognized leader in climate change mitigation, and adding adaptation to our \n\nbusiness will ensure that we can continue to meet City goals cost e˚ectively \n\nover time. \nScientists project that Vancouver will experience increased annual precipitation \n and temperatures, with hotter, drier summers. More intense and frequent \nrain and wind storms are anticipated and sea level rise will pose a signi˜cant \n\nchallenge by mid-century. \nThese changes mean an increasing risk of o\nverland \nand coastal ˛ooding, damage from storms and overheating during summer \n\nhighs. Without action, these risks threaten a wide spectrum of City goals \n\nfrom economic prosperity to liveability.\nVancouver is joining a group of leading cities in \nEurope, Australia and the United \nStates that have developed and implemented climate change adaptation actions. \nVancouver™s Adaptation Strategy is a priority action in both the \nGreenest \nCity Plan and the Corporate Strategic Business \nPlan. The City joined the \nICLEI Climate Change Adaptation \nInitiative pilot in late 2010 along with a \ncohort of local and regional governments across Canada. \nParticipants work \nthrough ICLEI™s ˜ve milestone methodology with the goal of developing and \nimplementing a climate change adaptation strategy over two years.\nThis Adapta\ntion Strategy focuses on understanding the climate impacts today \nand how they are expected to change in the coming century. \nIt provides a \nframework for identifying and prioritizing vulnerabilities and risks and then \n\nexploring measures to reduce the risk imposed by climate impacts. \nIt will guide development of policies and programs to build resiliency into everyday \noperations and short and long-term infrastructure investments. Accountability \n\nfor the actions lies primarily with the City but also with external partners. \n\nWe need to maintain or enhance the infrastructure, programs and services \n\nthat make Vancouver one of the most liveable cities in the world, even as \n\nstorms worsen and sea levels increase. \nThe Str\nategy is a living document and will continue to be revised and updated \n as climate change science and adaptation practice evolves. As this is the \n\n˜rst Adaptation Strategy for Vancouver, many of the proposed actions focus \n\non increasing our understanding of coming challenges and integrating climate \n\nchange into planning, design and emergency management. Successive iterations \n of the Strategy will yield more detailed actions.\nMany adaptation activities are already in place at the City driven by the need \n to manage observed climate changes, or to meet sustainability imperatives \nsuch as water conservation. \nThis Str\nategy takes a ﬁno regretsﬂ approach to \nclimate policy by identifying actions that build on these existing activities to \n\nimprove community resiliency and generate bene˜ts whether the extent of \n\nanticipated climate change materializes or not. \nThe Str\nategy begins with an overview and context for adaptation in Vancouver \n including adaptation basics and Vancouver™s future climate (chapters one  \n\nto three). Chapter four focuses on understanding the impacts and the cross- \n\ncutting issues they represent. Chapter ˜ve identi˜es the primary and supporting \n\nactions with a companion comprehensive action matrix located in Appendix A. \n A brief description of plan implementation and maintenance procedures \n\nconclude the plan. \nINTRODUCTION', '3STRATEGY VI\nSION: To ensure that Vancouver remains a liveable and resilient city, maintaining  \nits values, character and charm in the face of climate change.\nGUIDING PRINCIPLES:  \nUse the best scienc\ne available at the time of planning and review regularly. \n  P\nromote ˛exible and adaptive management approaches that leave a range \nof future options available.\n  G\nive priority to adaptation strategies that build on existing programs or \npolicies and provide co-bene˜ts with mitigation and sustainability goals. \n  Aim for int\negration into department business, ﬁmainstreamingﬂ, versus \nentirely new-sta˚ed projects.\n  E\nstablish and maintain strong networks with First \nNations and other levels \nof government as well as with partners such as the \nPort, the Board of \nTrade and the V\nancouver \nEconomic C\nommission. \n  Adapta\ntion e˚orts should be mindful of, and include, planning to meet  \nthe unique needs and conditions of people who are most vulnerable. \nGOAL\nS:Development and implementation of this strategy will:\n  I\nncrease the resilience of City infrastructure, programs and services  \nto anticipated local climate change impacts.\n  P\nromote and facilitate the incorporation of climate change information \ninto City business. \n  I\nmprove awareness, knowledge, skills and resources of City sta˚.\n  E\nnhance opportunities for coordination and cooperation through \n the development of networks and partnerships.\nVISION, PRINCIPLES AND GOAL\nS', '41 Climate Change Adaptation \nProject, 2012.

Examples include water conservation and \ne˚ective building envelopes which reduce \nGHGs now, but also mitigate the e˚ects of extended \nhotter, drier weather in the future. Sustainability \n\ngoals in general, as detailed in the \nGreenest City \nPlan, have extensive overlap with adaptation and \nmitigation actions. \nIntegration of the Adaptation \nStrategy with \nGreenest City \nPlan actions was completed in development of this strategy. \n1.2  R\nOLE OF LO\nCAL GOVERNMENT  IN ADAPTATION\nIt is widely recognized that adaptation is most \ne˚ectiv\ne at the regional and community scale. \nExposure to hazards, vulnerability, adaptive \n capacity and risk are all place-based in nature and \n many of the impacts anticipated from climate \n\nchange will a˚ect the services and infrastructure \n\nfor which local governments have the primary  \nresponsibility. Local governments also have \n\nmany of the tools necessary for adaptation such \n\nas planning, codes, standards and emergency \n\nresponse. \nLocal governments also invest in capital projects \nand programs that are expected to serve the City \n\nover many decades. \nGiven current replacement \nrates, new buildings will account for an equal or \n\ngreater fraction of building stock within climate \n\nchange timeframes. \nThe cos\nt of no action, both from a future retro˜t and public safety perspective, \n could be much higher than proactively planning \n\ninfrastructure to be resilient to future climate. \nThe cos\nt to build a new house, bridge or trans-\nmission line that is adapted to climate change for \n\nits lifecycle will only add 0% to 5% to construction \n costs which is signi˜cantly cheaper than restoring \n infrastructure post damage, retro˜tting, rebuilding \n or an increased lifetime maintenance bill.\n1 Economic \n value at risk from climate change was estimated  \nat between 1% and 12% of \nGDP by 2030 for \n various global locations. \nThe same study f\nound that between 40% and 68% of these losses could \n\nbe averted through adaptation measures for \n\nwhich economic bene˜ts outweigh costs.\n2 The National Round Table on the Environment and \nthe Econom\ny completed a cost bene˜t analysis \nof implementing proactive adaptation actions \n\nversus dealing with the consequences when they \n\noccur. \nThey c\noncluded that adaptation was a \ncost e˚ective way of dealing with many climate \n\nchange impacts.3 According to a recent University \n of Waterloo research project, climate change \n\nadaptation is ﬁsimply good and smart business \n\nfor Canadaﬂ.\n4 CHAPTER 1ADAPTATION IN VAN\nCOUVERMITIGATION\nPrevent climate \nchangeADAPTATION\nRespond to the \nimpacts of climate \nchangeFigure 1: \nMitigation and \nAdaptation t\no Climate Change\n', '5Local governments have a duty of care to their \ncitizens to ensure development decisions do not \n\ncreate the potential for unmanageable exposure \n\nto hazards. \nThey also ha\nve a special responsibility \nto those members of society who are more \n vulnerable to impacts from climate change. \nTo adapt to clima\nte change, local governments \nwill have to alter their traditional regulatory and \n\ndesign regimes to incorporate future projections \n\ninto decision-making. Many \nNorth American cities are well on their way to doing this and Vancouver™s \n e˚orts start here.\n1.3 ADAPTATION DEFINITION\nS:Adaptation:\n In human systems, adaptation is \nthe process of adjustment to actual or expected \n\nclimate and its e˚ects, in order to moderate harm \n\nor exploit bene˜cial opportunities.\n5 Adaptation is \na function of Vulnerability and \nRisk. Vulnerability:\n is the degree to which a system is \nsusceptible to, or unable to cope with a particular  \n\nclimate change impact. \nIt is a function of the character, magnitude and rate of climate variation \n to which a system is exposed; its sensitivity and \n\nits adaptive capacity.\n6Vulnerability =\n Exposure x Sensitivity x \nAdaptive Capacity\nExposure and Sensitivity: are almost inseparable  \nproperties of a system (or community). A coastal   \n\ncommunity like Vancouver is exposed to sea level \n\nrise while an Okanagan community may be ex-\nposed to drought. Sensitivity is the degree to which \n the system is a˚ected. At the municipal level, \nICLEI  suggests as\nsessing sensitivity by considering  \nexisting stresses that make a department sensitive \n and how much the performance or function of an  \n\narea may be a˚ected by a climate change impact. \nAdaptive Capacity:\n is similar to, or closely related \n to, a host of other commonly used concepts, \n including adaptability, coping ability, management \n capacity, stability, ˛exibility and resilience. \nThe determinants of adaptiv\ne capacity are the forces \nthat in˛uence the ability of the system to adapt \n\nsuch as managerial ability; access to ˜nancial, \n\ntechnological and information resources; infra-\n\nstructure; institutional environment; political \n in˛uence; kinship networks, etc. Adaptive capacity \n is context-speci˜c and varies from community  \n\nto community and among social groups and  \n\nindividuals, and over time.\n7Vulnerability \nAssessment:\n The proc\ness to prioritize \n climate change risks focusing on where we \n\nare the most susceptible. Vulnerability is a key \n\ndeterminant of potential impacts and disasters. \n\nFor example, a heat wave can have very di˚erent \n\nimpacts on distinctive populations depending on \n\ntheir vulnerability. \nClimate Change \nRisk: is a combined function of \nthe probability of a hazard (an event with the \npotential to cause harm, e.g. ˛oods, droughts) \n\noccurring and the magnitude or severity of its \n\npotential consequences (injury, damage, loss  \n\nof habitat etc.). \n8Risk = Likelihood (probability) x Consequence\nRisk Assessment: \nThe proc\ness to prioritize \nclimate change risks focusing on the potential \n\nconsequences of an impact. \nDisaster \nRisk Management: Improving the under-\nstanding of disaster risk; fostering disaster risk  \nreduction and transfer; and promoting continuous \n improvement in disaster preparedness, response, \n\nand recovery practices, with the explicit purpose \n\nof increasing human security, well-being, quality \n\nof life, resilience, and sustainable development.\n9Resilience:\n Resilience is the ability of a s\nystem \nand its component parts to anticipate, absorb, \n\naccommodate, or recover from the e˚ects of a \n\nhazardous event in a timely and e˝cient manner, \n\nincluding ensuring the preservation, restoration, \n\nor improvement of its essential basic structures \n\nand functions.\n105 Intergovernmental \nPanel on Climat\ne Change (IPCC), 2011.\n6 IPCC, 2001\n7  Smit, Barry and Johanna Wandel. 2006.

Vulnerability assessments are bottom up; identifying areas where \n\nthe community is sensitive and exposed to change. Both vulnerability and \n\nimpact assessments can sit comfortably within a broad risk assessment \n\nframework Œa systematic methodology to identify, assess, communicate  \n\nand manage risks. The ICLEI milestones follow a risk assessment format. \nThe Five \nICLEI Milestones are: \nInitiate, \nResearch, \nPlan, Implement and Monitor/\n Iterate. Figure 2 below outlines the main questions addressed in each milestone. \n Note that this Strategy is a result of Milestones one to three. Milestones 4 \nand 5 follow adoption of the Strategy. \n2.2 THE ADAPTATION \nTEAM:Deputy City Manager, Sadhu Johnston, played an important role as Adaptation \nChampion. He helped solidify aw\nareness and commitment to adaptation \nplanning within the organization and communicated our work to external \n\nstakeholders and partners. City \nEngineer, Peter Judd, our e\nxecutive sponsor,  \nwas also integral as an avid supporter of preparing for the impacts of climate \n change and ensuring resilient infrastructure over time. \nAn inter-departmental working group on adaptation was established in 2008 \n when initial investigation was completed. \nThe group w\nas re-convened in 2011 \nto support work on the \nICLEI adaptation process. \nThe Adapta\ntion Working  \nGroup completed many of the worksheets and tasks associated with the \nmilestones and provided a link back to their respective departments. A sea  \nlevel rise working group and adaptation steering committee were both \n established late in the planning process as the need arose. Many sta˚ members \n were involved throughout the adaptation planning process from identifying \n\nimpacts to prioritizing and reviewing actions. \nCHAPTER 2METHODOLOGY\nFigure 2: \nICLEI Adaptation \nInitiative \nMilestones\n˜˚˛˝˙˙\n˙\n˜˚˛˝˙˛ˆˇ˙\n˝\n˝\n˙\n˜˚˛˝˙˛ˆˇ˙\n\n˙\n\nˆ\n˙\n', '72.3 VAN\nCOUVER PROCESSFigure 3 below outlines the main actions carried out in the adaptation \n planning process. \nIn Milestone one, general managers from across the organization were inter-\nviewed to introduce them to the planning e˚ort and garner their initial feedback \n on impacts and department speci˜c actions. Research on anticipa\nted changes \n to climate variables (rain, wind, temperature) was presented as a basis for \nimpact identi˜cation by the \nGMs and subsequently by the working group. \nMilestone one also included a scan of existing policies, programs, plans and \n\nbylaws to identify existing adaptation actions and opportunities to include \n\nadaptation considerations.\nMilestone two focused on the risk and vulnerability assessments which were \ncompleted by the working group (see section 2.4). Starting with over 80 \n\nidenti˜ed impacts, the assessments prioritized the list to just over twenty key \n impacts. In collaboration with \nICLEI and PCIC, the Georgia Basin Adaptation \nInitiative participants commissioned a study of regional climate science to \nsupport adaptation planning. \nIdenti˜cation and prioritization of adaptation actions dominated milestone \nthree. \nDepartmental workshops focused on brainstorming actions to respond \n to, or minimize the risk imposed by impacts a˚ecting the department. \n\nWorkshops included a mapping exercise to identify assets vulnerable to \nsea level rise and voting to categorize actions from low hanging fruit to \n\ncomplex. \nIn order to focus detail on appropriate actions, the working group \nevaluated all actions against a set of criteria (see section 2.5). \nIterations of \nreview ensured departments were involved throughout the process. \n2.4 STRATEGY DE\nVELO\nPMENTThe vulnerability and risk as\nsessments were the primary tool used in Strategy \n development. \nThe asses\nsments focused this round of adaptation planning on \n those impacts that we are the most susceptible to, and that will have the \n\ngreatest consequences. \nPlease refer to Appendix B for more detailed information \n from the vulnerability and risk assessment. \n2.4.1 VULNERA\nBILITY ASS\nESS\nMENTVulnerability refers to the susceptibility of a given service area to harm arising \n from climate change impacts. \nIt is a function of a department™s sensitivity to \nclimate change and its capacity to adapt to impacts with little to no cost or \n\ndisruption. Medium and high vulnerability impacts are moved on to the risk \n\nassessment. \nVulnerability = \nSensitivity x Adaptive Capacity \nSensitivityTo conduct a sensitivity as\nsessment, Vancouver™s Adaptation Working \nGroup looked at each identi˜ed impact and assessed how the functionality of the \n\nprimary department would be a˚ected if the impact were to occur. Vancouver \n decided to look at the sensitivity of the primary department between now \n\nand 2080. Sensitivity was ranked on a scale of 1 to 5. \nAdaptive Capacity \nInherent to the analysis of adaptive capacity is the assumption that certain \nsystems can accommodate changes in climate with minimal disruption or \n\nadditional cost. \nThose sy\nstems which cannot accommodate changes have  \na low adaptive capacity. \nFigure 3: The City of \nVancouv\ner™s \nAdaptation Planning Pr\nocess\n˜˚˛˝˙ˆ\n˜˚˛˝˙ˆ\nˆˇ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nˆˇ\nˇ˛‘˘\n\n\n\n˜˛“\n\nˇˆ\n\n˜˚˛˝˙ˆ\n˜˚˛˝˙ˆ\n\n', '8In order to measure Vancouver™s adaptive capacity, impacts were assessed \nbased on the cos\nt and amount of sta˚ intervention that would be needed \nto adapt. \nEngineering was most frequently identi˜ed as having low adaptive \ncapacity; a direct re˛ection of how built infrastructure is generally unable to \naccommodate major changes in climate without additional costs and potentially \n\nsigni˜cant disruptions. Given sensitivity and adaptive capacity, vulnerability is ranked as follows.\n2.4.2 RISK ASS\nESS\nMENTRisk is a function of the likelihood and consequence of an impact where  \nlikelihood r\nefers to the probability of the projected impact occurring, and \nconsequence refers to the known or estimated e˚ects (economic, ecological, \n social or legal) of a particular impact. Risk =Likelihood x Consequence\nLikelihood \nTo determine the lik\nelihood, Vancouver characterized the impact as a single \nevent (windstorm) or a recurring event (increasing annual rainfall). A likelihood \n rating from 1 to 5 was then assigned where 1 is ﬁrareﬂ and 5 is ﬁalmost certainﬂ.\nConsequence \nThe second s\ntep of a risk assessment is to evaluate the consequence of an  \nimpact. Using a relatively common risk assessment matrix, Vancouver looked \n at how the impacts would a˚ect ˜ve areas: public safety, local economy and \ngrowth, community and lifestyle, environment and sustainability, and public \n\nadministration. Matrix ratings ranged from 1 (negligible) to 5 (catastrophic). \nThe sum of all the consequenc\ne values was then totalled to give the impact \nan overall consequence rating. \nConsequence and likelihood are then multiplied to obtain a risk rating on the \nfollowing scale. \n2.5  EV\nALUATION OF \nADAPTATION \nACTIONS Workshops were held with sta˚ across the organization to brainstorm actions \n to prepare for, or reduce risks from, the prioritized impacts. Workshop \n participants then reviewed a consolidated list of potential actions before  \n\nthe working group evaluated them. Criteria from the Canadian Communities™ \nGuidebook for Adaptation to Climate Change were used to rank the actions. \nThe criteria and r\nanking descriptions are listed in \nTable 1. Actions with lo\nw scores were discussed and most often discarded. \nOthers were \n ranked into the following categories: ﬁmust doﬂ, ﬁmonitorﬂ or ﬁinvestigate \n\nfurtherﬂ.

Basic data from \nthe study are included in this chapter with more \n\ndetail available in the full report. A general study \n\n˜nding was that projected change by the 2050s \n\nappears modest while by the 2080s projected \n\nchange describes a future climate that is almost \n\nunrecognizable in comparison to historical climate. \nCHAPTER 3CLIMATE CHANGE S\nCIENCE11 Paci˜c Climat\ne Impacts Consortium and IPCC ', '11The following climate variables were modelled by  \nPCIC for the region. \nThey ar\ne all described against \na 1961-1990 baseline unless otherwise stated. \nPrecipitation as Snow:\n Vancouver™s drinking \nwater comes from mountain reservoirs and the \n\nsnowpack melt and rainfall that supply them. \n\nApril 1 snowpack has decreased on average by \n\n25% in BC over the past 50 years with some sites \n\nexperiencing a 50% reduction.\n12 Precipitation as snow is projected to decrease in \nthe areas of Metro Vancouver that are important \n\nfor water supply. \nReductions will be evident b\ny the 2050s and precipitation as snow is projected \n\nalmost to disappear by 2080. \nGrowing Degree Days:\n Growing degree days \n(GDD) are an important indica\ntor of opportunities \n for agriculture but may also increase the risk of \n\ninvasive species spread. \nThey ar\ne determined by \nthe accumulation of degrees over 5°C per day. \n\nAnnual GDDs are a sum of degrees accumulated  \nthis way for each day of the year. \nRegionally,\n modeled GDDs are projected to increase by \n approximately one to two thirds in the 2050s and \n\nto as much as double by the 2080s from a baseline \n\nof approximately 1700 degree days. \nAnnual Heating and Cooling degree days:\n Heating \n and cooling degree days are useful indicators \n\nof energy demands required for heating and \n\ncooling. HVAC systems, general building design, \n\ndistrict energy systems and other energy infra-\n\nstructure all rely on this information. An approximate \n\n25% and 35% reduction by the 2050s and 2080s \n\nrespectively in heating degree-days signals a \n signi˜cant reduction in cold season energy \n requirements. \nClimate VariableSummary of ChangeSnapshot of \nAnticipated Changes\nIncrease in average \nannual precipitation \nwith a decrease in \n\nthe summer.\nAver\nagesA Increase of 6% and 9% in winter and decrease of 15% and 14% in the \nsummer by the 2050s and 2080s respectively. \nWet day\nsB, C  By the 2050s, precipitation during extremely wet days is expected \n\nto increase 28% relative to the baseline period (1971-2000).\nExtreme events\nC By the 2050s, a daily rainfall event that occurred once every 25 \n\nyears in the past is expected to occur almost 2.5 times as frequently.\nIncrease in average \nannual temperature \n\nwith most notable \n\nchange in night-time \nlows. \nAver\nagesA  Annual increase of 1.7°C by the 2050s and 2.7°C by the 2080s.\nWarm day\ns  Summer days above approx. 24°C are projected to occur more than \n\ntwice as frequently in the 2050s than during the baseline period \n\n1971-2000.\nExtreme events\n In the 2050s, an extreme heat event that occurred once every 25 \nyears in the past is expected to occur over 3 times as frequently.\nRising SeasAver\nages The Province of B.C. recommends using 0.5m global mean sea level \nincrease to 2050, 1.0m to 2100 and 2.0m to 2200. \nThere is a wide \nrange of projections for sea level rise by 2100 from 45cm to over 2m.\nExtreme events\n Sea level rise will cause problems when experienced together with \n\nstorm surge. \nDetailed storm surge projections are not available.\nAn increase in extreme events is projected including windstorms \n\nand heavy rainfall. \nA Average change based on 30 \nGlobal Climate Model projections.

From a historical baseline \n of only 55 cooling degree-days annually in Metro Vancouver, projected \nincreases range from at least double by the 2050s to as much as a factor of \n\n10 increase by the 2080s. Alternatives to vast application of air conditioning \n\nwill need promotion in order to avoid adaptation that increases greenhouse \n\ngas emissions.\nSummer day-time high temps:\n Projected increases in summer day-time \nhigh temperatures indicate a summer climate by the 2050s between that  \nof present-day Seattle and San \nDiego.Frost \nFree Period:\n Freeze-thaw can be hard on vegetation and infrastructure \n alike. \nThe fros\nt free period in the urban parts of the study area are already \nquite high with the majority of the year (roughly 200 days/year) frost free \n\non average during the 1961-1990 period. \nProjections indicate a new normal \nby the 2080s of virtually frost free conditions. \nFraser River Hydrology:\n The portion of the Fraser c\nontiguous with Vancouver \n is tidally dominated. \nNevertheless, changes in runo˚ timing and the seasonal \n distribution of runo˚ could have implications for water availability and habitat. \n By the 2050s winter and spring ˛ows are projected to increase by 56% to 85% \n and 37% to 56% respectively and summer ˛ow to decrease by 13% to 23% \n\nfor the Fraser- Hope hydrometric station. \nThe mean annual peak ˛ow is\n projected to occur about 10 days earlier.\n13 3.2.2 EXTREMES: The head of climat\ne monitoring and attribution at the U.K™s Hadley centre for \n Climate Change, explains that for every 1 degree Celsius rise in temperature,  \n\nthe amount of moisture that the atmosphere can contain rises by 7% or more. \n\nﬁThe upshot is that o\nverall rainfall increases only 2% to 3% per degree of warming, \n where extreme rainfall increases 6% to 7%ﬂ.\n14 In basic terms, this is due to the \n large-scale ener\ngy balance of the planet. With extra moisture in the atmosphere, \nwhen precipitation does occur, it™s more likely to be in bigger events. \nCurrent observations support an increase in storm intensity. \nToront\no recently \n initiated a program to improve storm drains after experiencing eight extreme \n storms (more than 1 in 25 year intensity) between 1986 and 2006. \nThe Insurance Bureau of Canada states that severe storm-related water damage \nhas doubled since 1992 to 44% of claims.\n15 PCIC used eight Regional Climat\ne Models (RCMs) to project changes in extremes. \nThe project\ned change from the 1971-2000 baseline period is projected for \nthe 2050s (2041-2070) in all cases. \nIn the case of warm days (\nTable 3, \n ˜rst row), the ratio can be interpreted as warm days occurring 2.2 times \n as frequently by the 2050s.\nExtreme precipitation is projected to increase for all the precipitation indices. \n The perc\nent of annual total precipitation that falls during events that are larger \n than the 95th percentile of events in the past is projected to increase by \nabout 21% on average (\nTable 3, ro\nw 2).

A return period (or recurrence \ninterval) is an estimate of the interval of time between events (earthquakes, \n˛oods) of a certain intensity of size. \nThe table below sho\nws the ratio of \nfuture to past return periods. For example, the median value of 5.8 for the \nTable 3: Summary of project\ned annual changes in 2050 from the 1971-2000 \nbaseline for all eight \nRCM runs and all months except for warm days which are \ngiven for summer and heaviest precipitation days indicated for September. \n', '1325th return period for 3 hourly precipitation (highlighted) indicates that an \nevent that occurred every 25 years during the past (4% chance of occurring \n\neach year) is expected to occur almost six times more frequently by 2050.\nIn Metro Vancouver, 5-, 10-, and 25- year return period daytime high hot events \n are projected to occur 2.4, 2.8, and 3.2 times as often, respectively. \nReturn periods for w\net events are projected to occur 1.6, 1.9, and 2.5 times as often, \nrespectively.\nDuring the last century sea level rose by almost 8ﬂ (20 cm). What is most \nnotable is that the rate of rise is increasing rapidly, almost doubling in the \n\nlast three decades.\n16 Based on present and expected increases in emissions \nin the near future, sea levels are expected to rise at accelerating rates into \n\nthe next century. Close monitoring and measurement over the last ˜fteen \n\nyears has shown that the present trend is close to, or above, the upper  \n\nenvelope of global scenarios. \nProjections for sea level cover a range, with greater weighting in the middle, \nas in most probability curves. Moderate projections for global average sea \n\nlevel rise this century are approximately 3 feet (1 m), but a few recent papers \n\nhave raised the upper limit to 6 feet (2 m). Such forecasts are regularly \n\nrevised and have generally moved upward over the last decade as the extent \n\nof melting in Greenland and Antarctica increased.\n17 Jurisdictions around the  \nworld are using various sea level rise ˜gures in planning to the end of the \n\n21st century. \nThe New Zealand Ministry of \nEnvironment is suggesting a 0.8m  \nincrease in areas where impacts will have high consequences. \nThe U.S Arm\ny Corps uses 1m and 1.5m for low and high scenarios respectively; the \nDelta Committee of the \nNetherlands uses a range from 0.55m to 1.2m and the Lowe \n Study for the U.K released 2.5m as the upper limit of scenarios by 2100. \nIn May, 2011 the BC Ministry of \nEnvironment released draft guidelines providing \n sea level rise ˜gures for use in evaluation of existing dikes, ˛ood-proo˜ng \n\nrequirements and long term land use and planning issues. \nIn formulating the \nguidelines, the Province created a sea level change envelope re˛ecting the \nranges of the most recent peer reviewed scienti˜c projections. \nThey chose \na median curve as the basis for de˜ning policy in BC that translates to the \n˜gures in table 5 below. \nVariablePeriod\n51025Daily Tempera\nture\nLower bound\n0.3\n0.1\n<.1\nProjected change\n2.42.83.2Upper bound2.53.064.3\nDaily Precipitation\nLower bound\n0.70.4\n0.1\nProjected change\n1.61.92.5Upper bound1.7\n2.23.1\n3-hourly Precipitation\nLower bound\n0.70.4\n0.2\nProjected change\n2.53.55.5Upper bound2.63.65.83-hourly Wind Speed\nLower bound\n0.2\n0.1\n<.1\nProjected change\n0.8\n0.9\n1.1\nUpper bound1.92.43.3Development \nTimeframe\nGlobal increase in mean sea level\n Regional SLRLifespan t\no Year 20500.5 m\nTo be dev\neloped on a site speci˜c basis. \nLifespan to \nYear 21001.0 m\nLifespan to \nYear 22002.0 m\n16  E\nnglander, John. 2010.

At the regional and local scale, sea level  \n\nwill also be a˚ected by local ocean and weather characteristics such as \n salinity, wind and currents, and by the vertical movement of the land due  \n\nto geological processes (subsidence and uplift).\nTable 4: Return period projections (r\negional median)Table 5: BC Ministry of Environment sea level rise planning ˚gures\n', '14CHAPTER 4IMPACTS\n AND ISSUESANTICIPATED CHANGES TO climate variables, as  \ndescribed in Chapter 3, will cause impacts felt \nacross City departments. An example of a climate  \nchange impact is increased street ˛ooding caused \n by increases in intensity and duration of rainfall.  \nImpacts share common overarching themes \nthat are brie˛y discussed in this chapter to help \n\ndecision-makers, working on these policy areas, \n\nidentify climate risks and opportunities. \n4.1 \nIMPACTSFrom Chapter 3, the most relevant climate change \n impacts Vancouver will experience are:\n  \nFlooding and/or inunda\ntion due to sea level rise;\n  O\nverland ˛ooding due to increased frequency \nand intensity of precipitation;\n  \nDamage from increased frequency and intensity \nof wind and rain storms; and\n  Health impacts from mor\ne days of extreme \nwarm temperatures and heat waves.\nOverall changes in climate trends such as warmer, \ndrier summers and more extreme events will also \ncause impacts. See table 6 for all the prioritized \n\nimpacts. Several Vancouver characteristics standout as \nsigni˜cant vulnerabilities to climate change \n which in turn drive adaptation priorities. \n  Lo\nwer income households; the homeless and \nthose housed in poor quality housing are  \nparticularly vulnerable to climate change and \n\nnatural hazards due to where they live within \n\ncities, the lack of reliable basic services, and their \n\nshortage of resources to deal with disruption. \n  \nLow-lying coastal and Fraser-fronting areas  \n\ninclude signi˜cant infrastructure, neighbourhoods, \necosystems and are central to Vancouver™s  \n\naesthetic and amenity-centred charm. \nTable 6 summarizes the impacts tha\nt were prior- \nitized through the vulnerability and risk assessments. \nImpacts are organized by the expected climate \nchange (high level impact in the case of sea level  \n\nrise). \nThe general changes ca\ntegory includes \nimpacts felt from a collection of the other climate \n\nchanges. 4.2 CROSS\n-CUTTING ISSUESThe following discussion brie˛y touches on the \nissues common to many climate change impacts, \nhighlighting focus areas for adaptation planning. \n4.2.1\n INFRASTRUCTUREInfrastructure assets provide a signi˜cant oppor- \ntunity for adapta\ntion. They ha\nve long operational  \nlifetimes, meaning they will be exposed to both \n\ncurrent and future climate. \nInfrastructure in Canada \n is relatively vulnerable to climate change as it \n is aging and over-used with population and \n\ndevelopment pressures increasing associated \n\nexpectations for service. \nWeathering of infrastructure can occur via biological\n  (mould), chemical (corrosion), thermal (freeze-\nthaw) or mechanical agents (wind-driven rain); \n\nall of which will be a˚ected by climate change. \nDamage to infrastructure from extreme weather \n events tends to increase dramatically above  \n\ncritical thresholds. \nEnvironment Canada reported  \nthat a 25% increase in peak wind gust can generate \n a 650% increase in building damage claims.\n18Aside from direct changes to weather conditions, \n\nclimate change will also a˚ect patterns of supply \n\nand consumer demand. For example, higher \n\nsummer temperatures may increase demand for \n\ntransportation to beaches and mountains, while \n\nincreased severe weather may a˚ect supply \n\nchains and resources that infrastructure and  \n\nrepair companies rely on. \nMaladapted infrastructure will have indirect  \nimpacts in the way of asset management costs,  \n\ninsurance claims and negative e˚ects on reputation.\n  A Vancouver rainstorm in 2010 resulted in 173 \n\n˜led claims with the City and a 2005 rainstorm \n\nin Toront\no ranks as the second largest insurance \npayout in Canadian history. An \nOntario-speci˜c study predicted the following increases in insured \nlosses due to rainfall related water damage: 13%, \n\n20% and 30% for the 2020s, 2050s and 2080s \n\nrespectively.\n19 18 Auld, Heather and Mac\nIver, \nDon. 2007.

Œ \nToront\no, Montreal, Vancouver \nand Calgary.\n', '174.2.3 HABITAT, PARK\nS AND GREENSPACEThe preservation and expansion of trees and greenspaces in Vancouver \ncontributes to both climate change mitigation and adaptation. Vegetation \nabsorbs carbon, helps keep the city cooler in the summer and increases the \namount of groundwater recharge, thereby lowering ˛ood risk. \nUrban structures such as asphalt and buildings absorb more solar energy  \nthan grass and trees increasing the local temperature Œ a phenomenon known \n as the urban heat island e˚ect. Vegetation in the downtown helps decrease this \n\ne˚ect, providing a safer environment health wise and lowering the need for \n\nair conditioning. Models have shown areas like airports with a high proportion \n\nof pavement can be almost 9°C warmer than areas with heavy vegetation \n\ncover such as parks.\nParks and greenspac\ne can also play an important role in decreasing the impacts \n or occurrence of ˛ooding from heavy rainfall or storm surge. \nParks can be \nused for detention and in˜ltration of stormwater or as containment areas \n for heavy storm surge. \nBeyond the number of trees and greenspaces in the City, the health of the \nurban ecosystems is paramount. Climate change is predicted to exacerbate \n\nundesirable agents of rapid change such as invasive pests or indigenous pests \n\nwhich are opportunistic to new environmental stress. Monitoring is essential \n\nto ward o˚ major problems before they exceed our ability to control them. \nHabitats found within the urban landscapes are often characterized as \nhabitat islands within a sea or buildings. Climate change will exacerbate the \n\nimplications of habitat isolation necessitating a renewed e˚ort to increase \n\nhabitat connectivity. \nThe Stanle\ny Park Management Plan includes considerations for climate change \n such as ‚wind-proo˜ng™, appropriate site selection/ planting practices, species \n\nselection and pest monitoring. \nThese consider\nations will need to be applied \nto other urban greenspaces and trees including development landscape plans, \n street trees and trees on private property. \n4.2.4 ECONOMYClimate change can be thought of as a pervasive economic shock that will \n\npotentially a˚ect all sectors of the economy.\n22 Both goods movement and \nlocal business are likely to be a˚ected by climate change and associated sea \n\nlevel rise with the potential to compromise Vancouver™s and the \nProvince™s \neconomy. \nIt is important to consider the economic advantages climate \nchange may provide as well. Warmer summers may attract more tourists \n\nand longer growing seasons allow for new agriculture crops in the region. \nThe National Round Table on the Environment and the \nEconom\ny (NRTEE) found that world-wide greenhouse gas emissions and subsequent climate \nchange impacts could, in turn, have an economic impact on Canada of  \n\n$5 billion annually by 2020 and between $21 and $43 billion annually by 2050. \n Speci˜c to BC by the 2050s, timber supply impacts could range from $2 billion \n\nto $17 billion annually and ˛ooding damages to coastal dwellings could cost \n\nbetween $1 billion to $8 billion per year. \nThe report c\noncluded that ignoring \nclimate change now will cost us more in the long run and that adaptation is \n\na cost-e˚ective way to alleviate many of the impacts of climate change.\n23  \nAn international cost bene˜t study echoed the \nNRTEE ˜ndings, reporting that \nbetween 40% and 68% of the loss in \nGDP expected to 2030 (under severe \nclimate change scenarios) could be averted through adaptation measures \n\nfor which economic bene˜ts outweigh their costs.\n2420  World Bank. 2011.

Businesses are already on the frontline \n of climate change with bottom lines increasingly \n\nat risk due to weather and climate phenomena. \nImpacts to businesses from climate change can \nbe categorized into physical and operational  \n\nimpacts such as decreased availability or increased \n price of critical materials; regulatory and legal \n\nrisks such as new land use zoning or building \n\nchanges; ˜nancing risks such as access to capital  \n\nfor businesses at high risk to climate change; \n\nmarket changes; and reputational risks.\n26 It will  be impera\ntive for businesses to demonstrate \n a commitment to adaptation, raise awareness \n\nand collaborate through new forms of public-\n private partnerships to tackle the most complex \n\nchallenges of adaptation.\n27 4.2.5 COA\nSTAL Z\nONEThirty eight perc\nent of the Canadian population lives \n within 20km of a coast or great lake shoreline.\n28 Coastal areas are exceptionally vulnerable to sea \n\nlevel rise given that they are home to concentrated \n populations, economic centres and valuable eco-\n\nsystems. Coastal industry remains integral to the \n\ntransportation and transfer of goods. \nA 2008 OECD report ranked Vancouver 15th out \nof 136 large port cities in terms of the value of \nassets exposed to sea level rise.\n29 BTA Works, the \nresearch arm of a local architecture ˜rm, found \nthat industrial lands, historic areas and the public \n\nrealm would be a˚ected disproportionally in a \n\n5m sea level rise scenario. Conversion of these \n\nindustrial lands to residential areas is likely to \n increase the consequences of a ˛ood. \nThe National \n Round Table on the Environment and the \nEconom\ny \n predicted sea level rise to cause between $2.1 billion \n and $7.6 billion in damages by 2050 for BC \n (primarily Metro Vancouver) based on a sea level \n\nrise of 0.28m to 0.85m by 2100. \nThey es\ntimate \nthat $25 billion worth of real estate (not including \nCity infrastructure) would be heavily impacted with \n\nthe cost of su˝cient protective measures such as \n\nearth dikes or seawalls estimated to range from \n\n$255 million to $510 million (2011 dollars).\nRecogniz\ned adaptation responses to sea level rise \n can be grouped into four broad categories as \n\nfollows:\n  Prot\nect: Protect the coastline through structural \n mechanisms such as dikes and seawalls.\n  Acc\nommodate: \nIncrease ˛ood construction \nlevels, add covenants for liability reduction  \nand retro˜t existing buildings.\n  Planned Retrea\nt: withdraw, relocate or abandon \n private or public assets due to coastal hazard.\n  Avoid:\n identify future ‚no build™ zones or use land \n acquisition or restriction tools such as land trusts. \nThe United Kingdom is a leader in c\noastal ˛ood \nrisk management.

Where there are no primary \n actions to address a climate change, only a \n suite of supporting actions are introduced. \nPrimary actions, supporting actions and more \ndetailed actions are listed with accountability \n and timing information in a comprehensive \n Adaptation Action Matrix found in Appendix A. \nThe matrix is or\nganized by impacts under the \nsame section headings as the chapter below. \nNo-regret actions are the focus Œ those that \nbuild on existing plans and actions and provide \n\ncommunity bene˜ts regardless of the extent of \n\nclimate change experienced. \nEach objective is \n achieved through a combination of di˚erent \n actions which act together. \nThese portfolios\n  of actions generally include measures from \n the following four categories: \n  \nmodifying policies, plans, proc\nedures, standards \n (e.g. by-laws, development plans, operating \npractices, codes); \n building new or upgr\nading infrastructure; \n  impro\nving community awareness and  \neducation; and\n  varying/\ndiversifying existing actions (e.g. diver-\nsifying energy supplies, diversifying plantings).\nThe actions in the Str\nategy largely focus on areas \nwhere the City can take independent action. \nTo this \nend we completed an early scan of suggested \nadaptation actions to ascertain whether they \n fell within the City™s jurisdiction/responsibility or \n\nnot. Some actions signal necessary collaboration \n\nwith the regional and provincial governments, \n\nand it is recognized that local adaptation is \n\nreliant on close ties and joint actions with other \n\nlevels of government, neighbours, the private \n\nsector and community groups. Sta˚ will continue \n\nto collaborate on projects and push for regional \n\ncoordination on adaptation issues. \n1.0 \n I\nNCREASE IN INTENSITY AND  FREQUENCY OF HEAVY RAIN EVENTSImpacts: Increased surface water ˛ooding, sewer \nback-ups and c\nombined sewer over˛ows due to \nheavy rainfall.\nWhat this c\nould mean: On September 19th, 2010 \nVancouver™s heavy rainfall resulted in 173 ˜led claims \n\nagainst the City and 23 other reports of ˛ooding \n\nrelated incidents from citizens. \nThe second mos\nt expensive national natural disaster was \nToront\no™s \n2005 downpour with damages exceeding $500 \n\nmillion.\n30 Rainfall related water damage losses are \nexpect\ned to continue increasing (20% by 2050 \nin Eastern Canada) as is the volume of untreated \nwastewater entering waterbodies via combined \n\nsewer over˛ows (CS\nO). These climat\ne change impacts have far-reaching social, environmental \n\nand economic implications. \nOBJECTIVE 1.1:\n MINIMIZE RAINFALL  \nRELATE\nD FLOODING AND ASS\nOCIATED CONSEQUENCESThe City will take adv\nantage of the following  \nopportunities to reduce rainfall related risks:\n  \nDecreasing the proportion of stormwater entering \n the sewer infrastructure through application of \nstormwater management techniques.\n  I\nncreasing the capacity of the storm sewer \nthrough sewer separation.\n  \nAc\ncounting for climate change in system design.\n1.1.1 PRIMARY \nACTION: COMPLETE AND  IMPLEMENT A CITYWIDE INTEGRATED  ST\nORMWATER \nMANAGEMENT PLAN \nApplying stormwater management techniques \n\nwhere possible can reduce peak discharges and \n\ngenerally reduce the ˛ow loading on storm sewer \n\ninfrastructure, thereby increasing resilience to heavier \n\nand more frequent storm events. Stormwater \n\nmanagement approaches are categorized into:\n  P\nlanning and design approaches such as limits to impermeable surfaces;\n  R\nuno˚ storage and conveyance such as using \npocket parks for street runo˚, re-routing \n stormwater to waterbodies, or non-potable \nwater storage/use; and\n  \nIn˜ltration and detention practices such as green \n roofs, street in˜ltration bulges or downspout \n\nrock pits.\nStormwater management techniques often include \n green infrastructure (bioswales, green roofs, rain  \n\nbarrels) which provide a host of co-bene˜ts with  \n\nother City goals.

Separating the \nsystems also provides more capacity in the storm \n\nsewer for handling anticipated increases in heavy \n\nrainfall volumes.\nThe City is legislat\ned to complete system separation \n by 2050. Currently, high risk areas, or areas where \n residents have experienced more frequent sewer \n\nbackups, are targeted for priority separation. \n\nSeparation of private side connections is not \n\nmandated and will require a closer look to ensure \n\nthe added resilience of separated pipes is not \n\nnegated at the property line.\nSupporting Actions:   E\nxplore options for increasing replacement of \nprivate side combined sewer connections with \nseparated connections in advance of City-side \n\nseparation. \n  P\nrepare runo˚ control guidelines for private \nproperty as r\nequired by Metro Vancouver in \ncoming years. \n  Add lar\nger catch basins or increase number \n in critical locations.\n  \nEvalua\nte and recommend opportunities for \nstormwater detention, in˜ltration or storage \n\nduring park re-design and in new parks.\n  I\nncorporate rainfall projections and new \nIDF curves in sewer and street design.\n  I\nncrease public awareness of catch basin \n functionality and basement ˛ooding mitigation. \n2.0 SEA \nLEVEL RISE Impacts: Increased ˛ooding, storm surge damage, \n saltwa\nter intrusion and erosion to the coastline. \nImpacts to gravity drainage of low lying storm \nsewers and potential impacts to groundwater levels.\nWhat this c\nould mean: Climate change is imposing \n increasing threats along coasts, both from rising \n\nsea levels and increased intensity and frequency  \n\nof storms. Based on present and expected increases \n in emissions in the near future, sea levels are \n expected to rise at accelerating rates into the \n\nnext century. \nA local study used assessment values to estimate \nthat $25 billion worth of real estate (not including \n\nCity infrastructure) is at risk from sea level rise in \n\nVancouver by the end of the century. \nIndustrial  lands, historic areas and the public realm are \n\na˚ected disproportionately.\n31 The federal \nRound \nTable on the Environment and the \nEconom\ny \n suggest the annual national costs of coastal \n\n˛ooding damage could be as high as $8 billion \n\ndollars in coming decades. \n31 Keenan, \nEileen and Yan, Andre\nw. 2011. \nThe Local \nE˚ects of Global Climate Change in the City of Vancouver: A Community \nToolkit and Atlas.\n', '21OBJECTIVE 2.1:\n INCREASE THE RESILIENCE OF VAN\nCOU\nVER\n™S  INFRASTRUCTURE AND ASS\nETS TO COA\nSTAL FL\nOODING  AND EROSIONSea level rise adaptation options include protecting our coastlines with defences, \n accommodating higher water levels by elevating infrastructure, avoiding \n˛ood prone areas by focusing development elsewhere, and retreating via \n\nland acquisition etc. Choosing among options is a complex task that starts \n\nwith a clear risk assessment detailing the magnitude and frequency of coastal \n ˛ooding, identifying vulnerabilities and quantifying potential damages and \n\nlosses. \nThe City endeav\nours to ˜nd solutions that minimize the ˜nancial,  \nsocial and environmental impacts of future ˛ooding while ensuring near-shore \n\namenities, access, views and other bene˜ts are maintained. A city-wide \n\nsea level adaptation response will provide high-level direction to navigate \n\nthrough the complex issues and make civic investments without creating \n\nundue hardships in the short term. \nWhile the risk assessment is being completed, the City™s interim ˛ood \n construction levels need to be revised, and associated Flood-proo˜ng policies \namended to provide certainty. \nPolicies will be re\nvisited and updated upon \ncompletion of the City-wide sea level rise response strategy. \n2.1.1 PRIMARY \nACTION: COMPLETE A COA\nSTAL F\nLOO\nD R\nISK \nASSESSME\nNT \nAND DEVELOP A CITY-WI\nDE SEA LEVEL RISE ADAPTATION RE\nSPONSEStrategic planning for sea level rise is complex given the uncertainty asso-\nciated with the rate of water level rise and changes in storm frequency, the \nenvironmental and ˜nancial implications of engineering solutions, and the \n\nlong timeline for fundraising and implementing such unique capital projects. \nIt took 30 years for the United Kingdom and the \nNetherlands to add new \nstorm protection after a disastrous coastal storm in 1953. While we are not \n\nexpecting observable impacts from sea level rise for some time, we need \n\nto start thinking about options now. A comprehensive risk assessment is a \n\nrecognized best practice and ˜rst step toward planning actions to mitigate \n\nthe risks posed by sea level rise.\nContinuing to coordinate with other municipalities regionally, with other \nlevels of \nGovernment, and with partners such as \nPort MetroV\nancouver will \nbe integral to maintaining the economic vibrancy of the region. \nThe ˛ood risk asses\nsment will include the following general phases of work:\n Phase 1: Flood hazard mapping/modeling\n Phase 2: Vulnerability Assessment\n Phase 3: Consequence Analysis\n  Phase 4: Risk Management Options/Trade-o˚ Analy\nsisRisk assessment outputs will support development of a city-wide sea level \nrise adaptation response that will address new infrastructure needs, erosion \n\nprotection considerations, land use regulation changes and plans for ameni-\n\nties such as beaches and the seawall. \n', '222.1.2 PRIMARY \nAC\nTION: UPDATE CITY \nFLOOD-PROOFING POLICIES  INCLUDING FLOOD CONSTRUCTION LEVELSWhile numer\nous municipalities in the lower mainland maintain many kilometers \nof dikes, the City of Vancouver has relied on other tools such as ˛ood \n construction levels (FCLs) and setbacks. City ˛ood-proo˜ng policies establish \nthese elevations and setbacks by ˛ood prone area. \nThe last amendment  \nto the policies in 2007 ˛agged the need for future updates to incorporate \nnew sea level rise information. \nThe BC Ministry of \nEnvironment released new guidelines outlining incorporation \n of sea level rise into FCL calculations in May, 2011. \nThe City encour\naged an  interim increase of 1m to existing FCLs while undertaking a study to apply  \n\nguideline methodology to speci˜c coastline types. Amending the ˛ood-proo˜ng \n\npolicies will increase the ˛ood resilience of new development and maintain \n\nthe potential for a range of adaptation solutions in the future. \nIncreasing the awareness of builders and developers with respect to ˛ood-proo˜ng methods \n\nand considerations will be an important complement to policy amendment. \nSupporting Actions:  Continue t\no coordinate with other regional municipalities and other levels \nof government to ensure a regional approach to coastal ˛ood management. \n  \nLe\nverage opportunities to evaluate strategic near-shore open space planning \nfor inundation and containment areas and saltwater resilient plantings. \n  \nInitiate a ˛ood-proo˜ng awareness campaign among builders and developers.\n  \nMonitor lo\nw-lying storm sewer capacity and functionality and continue \n to add back-up power and storage tanks to existing stormwater pumps.\n  Monitor gr\noundwater for increasing levels. Consider associated impacts  \nin coastal development design. \n3.0 \n I\nNCREASED FREQUENCY AND  INTENSITY OF STORM\nS AND WEATHER EXTREMESImpacts: Increased public safety and health risks; increased resources required \n to respond and recover following events. \nWhat this c\nould mean: In addition to earthquakes, the top hazards identi˜ed \nby emergency manage-ment in 2009 are weather related events, namely \nwind storms, blizzards, freezing rain/ice storms and rainstorms. \nThe 2006 Vanc\nouver windstorm cost the City approximately $10 million in forest resto-\nration, repairs, slope stabilization and planning. Following the August 2005 \n\nrainstorm in \nToront\no, the City spent over $40 million to bring the City™s \n infrastructure back into service. Storms can be bothersome to many in terms \n\nof service disruptions but can be lethal to vulnerable populations including \n\nthe sick, elderly, young, homeless and low-income community members. \nEnhancing resilience now will be cost e˚ective in terms of damages avoided \nin the long term. \nMany of the actions in this chapter and the action matrix (Appendix A) help \nbuild resilience to extreme events. \nThe follo\nwing actions focus on safety and \nhealth risks to vulnerable populations and response and recovery capacity. \nOBJECTIVE 3.2: INCREASE VANCOUVER™S CAPACITY TO RESPOND TO EXTREME WEA\nTHER EVENTS AND RECOVER EFFECTIVELYThe City™s emergency management and response capacity will need to cater \nto more frequent, simultaneous and extreme disasters. \nThis includes dealing with their cascading e˚ects such as po\nwer outages and road closures. Many \nexisting emergency management and response practices at the City can be \n\nexpanded to cover extreme weather events. \nIt will also be important to continue \nmonitoring resources including sta˚, their training and equipment, and City \n\ncontingency and insurance budgets to ensure they are evolving to meet new \n\nand possibly escalating needs. \n3.2.1 PRIMARY \nACTION: DEVELOP A POLICY FOR BACK-\nUP POW\nER \n AND ASS\nESS DEPARTMENTS FOR  SHORTFALLSA ke\ny cascading e˚ect of stormy weather is power outages which may in turn \n cause health impacts and service/business disruption. At the peak of the 2006 \nwindstorm, BC Hydro reported that over 250,000 customers were without power. \n', '23City infrastructure and facilities are often crucial during extreme event \nresponse such as community centres providing relief, ˜re halls, the works \n\nyards, tra˝c signals and some street lighting. \nOther City facilities and \n infrastructure may require back-up power to maintain basic services \n (such as stormwater sewer pumps). \nOne litre of generator diesel provides about 3 to 3.5 Kilowatt hours of power. \nTo retain basic function in a c\nommunity centre for one hour would therefore \nrequire 30 to 50L of fuel. \nIncreased severe weather may also a˚ect fuel  \nsupply chains and resources that infrastructure and repair companies rely on. \nIdentifying where investment in back-up power is integral to public safety, \nstorm response and recovery will build City resilience to extreme events.  \n\nA comprehensive look at backup power for public buildings and infrastructure \n\nincludes determining best methods of meeting the power needs and ensuring \n\nfuel supply during storms.\nThe follo\nwing steps for policy development are recommended:\n  I\ndentify and prioritize buildings and infrastructure for back-up power over \nand above life safety requirements.\n  Compar\ne the costs and bene˜ts of mobile generators versus generators \nbuilt into facilities.\n  P\nlan for fuel supply and emergency fuel movement from both outside \nproviders and city sources. \nSupporting Actions:  Continue adding back\n-up power to key tra˝c signals\n  Complet\ne planning for response to windstorms, rainstorms and ˛ooding.\n  Activ\nate plans and the \nEOC when events are forecast or occur. \n  Consider c\nontinuity of supply of key response resources such as plywood. \n  Support the Events \nRisk Assessment \nTask For\nce in ensuring events in the \nCity are safe and resilient to inclement weather. \n  Broaden ‚\nTeam Vanc\nouver \nEmergency \nResponse™ volunt\neer urban search \nand rescue to aid with extreme event response such as park patrol during \n\nheat waves. \nOBJECTIVE 3.1:\n REDUCE SAFETY AND HEALTH RISKS FOR THE HOMELESS AND LOW-IN\nCOME POPULATION DUE TO INCLEMENT WEATHERAdded shelter capacity exists now in the form of extreme weather response \n\nshelters that operate when speci˜c, provincially mandated criteria are met. \nThese criteria and the as\nsociated funding need to be expanded to keep up \nwith the increase in frequency and intensity of extreme weather. \nThe local low\n-income population is generally more vulnerable to extreme weather \ngiven their housing conditions, limited mobility, and lack of insurance and \n\nsavings. Health risks from mould and inclement weather are priorities within \n\nthis section while heat related risks are detailed in section 4 below. \nSupporting Actions:  E\nngage with Metro Vancouver to request at the regional level that the \nextreme weather shelter criteria and funding be expanded. \n  P\nartner with VCH t\no initiate an education campaign on mould; how to \nidentify and address it. \n  E\nnsure instances of mould are included in the new online rental database.\n', '244.0 \nHOTTER, \nDRIER SUMMERS Impacts: water supply shortages in late summer, increasing respiratory illness, \nhealth and safety risks f\nor vulnerable populations.\nWhat this c\nould mean: During extreme heat events, health risks from direct \nimpacts such as heat stroke increase, and many people with underlying health \nconditions will experience a worsening of their condition. \nThe heat w\nave \nin 2009 in Vancouver caused an estimated 122 ‚excess deaths™ and many \n\nemergency room visits. Vancouverites are generally less acclimatized to \n\nhigh temperatures and therefore have a lower threshold for health e˚ects. \n\nVulnerable populations such as older adults, infants and children, those with \n\nchronic illness and socially disadvantaged communities are also at higher risk. \nThe North Shore snowpack has decreased by over 20% in the last ˜fty years \nand is predicted to be almost non-existent by the year 2080. An increase in \n\nannual rainfall will help o˚set the decrease in source water for our drinking \n\nreservoirs but longer, drier summers may result in late summer water supply \n\npressure. \nOBJECTIVE 4.1:\n MINIMIZE PER CAPITA WATER \nCONSUMPTIONThe Greenest City Action \nPlan includes a target of reducing per capita water \nconsumption by 33% below 2006 levels. \n4.1.1 PRIMARY \nACTION: WATER C\nONSERVATION (\nIN PROGRESS)Water conservation actions in the \nGreenest City Action \nPlan include water \nmetering and enhanced water education, incentives and conservation programs. \nOBJECTIVE 4.2: MINIMIZE MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY \nDURING HEAT W\nAVES4.1.2 PRIMARY \nAC\nTION: SUPPORT THE EXTREME HOT \nWEATHER  \nCOMMITTEE IN \nCOMPLETION OF PHASE II OF PLANNING AND EXPAND THE HOT WEATHER \nPREPAREDNESS WORK PROGRAM.The City™s \nExtreme Hot Weather Committee completed \nPhase I of planning in 2011, including development of a heat alert and a ‚Be Cool™ communication \ncampaign. The second phase of w\nork is focused on actions to minimize  \nimpacts of heat on health, especially within vulnerable populations.

Looking ahead to heavier rain events, more wind \n\nand hotter summers will require consideration of new building measures to \n\nensure continued resilience. \nBuildings may be maladapted to hotter temperatures, susceptible to damage \nduring extreme weather and encounter new durability challenges. \nThe Urban Heat \nIsland E˚ect whereby highly urbanized areas experience higher tempera\n-tures will exacerbate summer cooling loads. \nEnvelope integrity may also be \nadversely a˚ected by increasing wind and rain loads and higher ambient \n\nmoisture levels.\nRecent Canadian adapta\ntion reports call for action by the Federal and \nProvincial \n governments in collaboration with the insurance industry to research design \n\npractices that are cost e˚ective and promote climate adaptation. Building \n\ndurability and disaster resilience are suggested as themes for upcoming \n\nbuilding code renewals. Ahead of national and provincial action, there are \n\nseveral opportunities to partner on adaptation incorporation in the next VBBL. \n The Institute for Catastrophic Loss \nReduction has rec\nently worked with \nOntario builders to recommend code modi˜cations for a changing climate and are \n\neager to repeat their process elsewhere. More data is required on localized \n\nparameters related to design loads such as wind uplift pressure. \nThe Paci˜c Climat\ne Impacts Consortium at the University of Victoria are eager to continue \nour existing collaboration. \nThe follo\nwing are adaptation measures to be evaluated and/or incorporated \ninto the building bylaw:\n Use of re˛ectiv\ne surfaces\n  Buildings are bett\ner equipped to manage heat gain (passive guidelines)\n  D\nevelopment in ˜re interface areas (near parks and woodlands)\n', '26 Construction safety (high winds)\n  Continue t\no lobby homeowners protection o˝ce for broader acceptance \nof green roofs. \n  O\nver˛ow mechanisms in roof design with route plan for ˛ood water and/\nor oversize roof drainage system.\n  E\nmergency management plans/evacuation plans for buildings;   \ncombine ˛ood hazard with seismic. \n  G\nray water use and rainwater capture for toilet ˛ushing and garden use.\nSupporting Actions:  I\nncorporate climate change as an asset management and infrastructure \ndesign consideration.\n  Collabor\nate with Cascadia \nRegion Urban Sustainability \nDirectors \nNetwork to investigate asset management approaches to planning for climate \nchange.\n  Continue t\no collaborate with Metro Vancouver on updated \nIntensity \n Duration Frequency (\nIDF) curves.

OBJECTIVE 5.2: INCREASE THE LONG-TERM HEALTH AN\nD VIGOUR OF URBAN FORESTS, GREEN SPACES AND TREESPublic and private trees were a focus of the access to nature goal in the \ngreenes\nt city plan given the vast array of bene˜ts they provide. \nGrowing \nhealthy, long lasting trees requires consideration of the future climate as \n well as appropriate siting, planting and maintenance. \nTrees c\nontribute to adaptation by:\n  I\nntercepting and ˜ltering stormwater runo˚ to prevent ˛ooding and  \nimprove water quality\n  Absorbing pollutants to clean the air\n  P\nroviding wind-breaks to protect buildings from damage\n  R\negulating urban hea\nt island e˚ects through shading and evaporation\nSome co-bene˜ts with other goals include:\n  Lo\nwer cooling demand for electricity\n Directly sequester carbon\n Wildlif\ne habitat \n Increased property value and liveability\n5.2.1 PRIMARY \nACTION: SUPPORT DEVELOPMENT OF A COMPREHENSIVE URBAN FOREST MANAGEMENT PLAN THAT FO\nCUSES ON GROWING SUCCESSFUL TREES IN URBAN AREAS. Through the \nGreenest City Action \nPlan we have committed to planting \n150,000 trees. An Urban Forest Management \nPlan will identify the issues \nand values most important to the community and provides a roadmap for \ninvesting in and maintaining our urban forest to 2020 and beyond. \nIt will  ', '27ensure that species selected and locations for planting targeted, maximize \ncivic investment and ensure longevity. \nIt will explicitly address climate \nchange impacts to trees and greenspaces as well as ensuring we take full \n\nadvantage of their potential to support City adaptation. \nA multi-department process led by arboriculture and park professionals is \nneeded. The For\nest Management plan should gather baseline data and provide \ndirection on development of standards and guidelines that address: \n  \nPreparing for challenges facing our urban forest in the 21st century including \n a changing climate. \n  I\nncreasing canopy cover citywide as a measure to help mitigate climate \nchange. Map canopy coverage with land use, identify tree de˜cient areas \nand work to add tree space and appropriate soils management to remedy \n\nthe de˜cit.   Hot spot and vulnerable popula\ntion mapping can be overlayed with  \ncanopy coverage to target certain areas for shade provision.\n  \nOrganizational changes that raise the pro˜le of trees and facilitate improved \nintegration of trees into urban design. \n  Minimize the nega\ntive impacts of new or existing trees.\n  Soil management: volume and mak\ne-up (loss of heritage soils).\n  \nEducat\ne an expert team across departments to champion trees and \n provide oversight.\n  D\nevelop an Urban Forest \nOperations \nProgram (Maintenance standards \nand budgets).\nSupporting Actions:   P\nromote public awareness of the critical role of urban forests in coping \nwith climate change. \n  Continue pes\nt and invasive species monitoring programs with climate \nchange as an added stressor. \n  \nEstablish funding levels adequate enough to reinstitute systematic pruning. \n  \nEnsure species and location selection criteria in the \nGCAP planting strategy, \n landscape guidelines and in the replacement tree list in the \nProtection of \nTree B\nylaw re˛ect future climate projections and any Urban Heat \nIsland E˚ect mapping.6.0 \n O\nRGANIZATIONAL A\nDAPTIVE CAPACITY OBJECTIVE 6.1:\n INCORPORATE ADAPTATION \nCONSIDERATIONS  IN CITY BUSINESSClimate change is an overarching issue that poses an additional risk or bene˜t \n to the way we do business. Successful adaptation will require moving beyond \n\nthis strategy to incorporation of climate change in risk management and \n\nproject planning across departments. \nRegular updat\nes to climate science will be shared throughout the organization \nfor consideration in design and planning. Mapping ˛ood hazard, urban heat \n\nisland e˚ect, tree canopy, landslide risk areas etc. provides a powerful baseline \n of information. Seattle and \nToront\no have both developed and applied software \n programs to support mainstreaming climate change that can be evaluated \n\nfor potential use in Vancouver. Collaborating with municipalities and other \n\npartners regionally will ensure we support regional resilience and continued \n\neconomic vibrancy. \nSupporting Actions:   Continue t\no collaborate regionally with First \nNations, Metro Vancouver \nand other municipalities.  I\nnvestigate best practices in ‚mainstreaming™ adaptation. Consider both \ninternal software programs and external communication/checklists.\n  Complet\ne mapping to support climate change adaptation with co-bene˜ts \nfor other applications.\n  Complet\ne a communication strategy, including community engagement, \nfor Climate Change Adaptation, especially sea level rise. \n ', '286.1 \nIMPLEMENTATION\nTHE DEPARTMENTS AND divisions identi˜ed as \n accountable for actions in the Strategy will be \n responsible for implementation. \nThe Sustainability\n Group will provide coordination among depart-\nments, deliver on speci˜c actions and support \ndepartments in their implementation of actions. \n\nWhere signi˜cant new actions are proposed, \n the need for an implementation plan and timeline \n\nwill be evaluated. \nIMPLEMENTATION THROUGH EXI\nSTING PROGRAMS AND PLANNINGThe e˚ectiveness of Strategy implementation \n is dependent on incorporation of outlined \n actions into existing plans, policies and programs. \n\nKey vehicles for adaptation incorporation are \n the following:\nGreenest City \nAction Plan: Many of the actions \npromoted for sustainability of the City have \n\nco-bene˜ts with climate change adaptation. \n Adaptation provides either an added driver, as \n\nwith water conservation, or an added consideration \n\nas is the case with the tree planting strategies. \nIntegrated Stormwater \nManagement Plan:  Improved management of stormwater will ensure \ncontinued functioning of the sewer system under \n\nheavier storm conditions. Vancouver has signi˜cant \n\nopportunities to enhance innovative management \n approaches from impervious surface policies to \n\nstreet design. \nThe Integrated Stormwater Manage-\n ment Plan will provide cross-departmental \nrecommendations to take advantage of these \n\nopportunities. Urban Fores\nt Management Plan: Long living, \n vigorous trees are necessary to pay back the \n cost of getting them to a size at which they \n\nstart to provide signi˜cant bene˜ts in terms of \n\ncarbon uptake, in˜ltration, shade provision and \n\nwater diversion. \nTo gro\nw successful trees in urban \nareas demands proper soil management, species \n\nselection, location and maintenance. Climate \n\nchange intensi˜es the need for high standards of \n\ntree management and the incorporation of future \n\nclimate considerations. \nVancouver Building By-law update 2017:\n Working \nwith the building and academic community to \n\nexplore best methods for incorporating changing \n\nclimate loads into the building code will support \n\na more resilient building stock in the coming \n\ndecades. Sewer Separation Strategy:\n Separating the storm  \nand sanitary sewers will reduce the risk of combined \n\nsewer over˛ows and private side sewer back-ups. \nThe exis\nting approach of prioritizing high risk areas \nfor early separation ensures resilience ahead of \n\nsigni˜cant shifts in storm pro˜les. \nExtreme Hot Weather C\nommittee: \nThe committ\nee, \nin partnership with Vancouver Coastal Health \n\ndeveloped a heat alert and Be Cool campaign \n in phase I of planning. Phase II of the project can be expanded to explore and implement many \n\nof the best practices and programs for heat that \n\nare being pursued by municipalities across \nNorth America.6.2  M\nETHOD AND SCHEDULE FOR  UPDATING THE PLAN \nOur global and local understanding of climate \nchange and its impacts, cos\nts and potential \nactions continues to evolve. Modeled projections \n\ncontinue to become increasingly sophisticated  \n\nand inputs change providing new ranges of \n anticipated temperature, precipitation etc. \n The City of Vanc\nouver intends to review and \n evaluate the Strategy annually and to update it \n\nevery ˜ve years from the date of initial Strategy \n\nadoption. This cy\ncle may be accelerated to less \nthan ˜ve years based on the following triggers:\n  A signi˜cant climat\ne change impact is experi\n-enced; and, or\n  Senior gov\nernment action or policy triggers \n the need to respond (e.g. as with \nProvincial \n Sea Level \nRise Guidelines).CHAPTER 6PLAN IMPLEMENTATION AN\nD MAINTENANCE PROCESS\n', '29Annual Evalua\ntion:Climate \nPrograms sta˚ in the Sustainability \nGroup \nwill be responsible for evaluating the Strategy and \nstaying current with climate science. Sustainability \n sta˚ will also participate in regional and provincial \n adaptation forums and partner with external \n\nstakeholders to pool resources and ensure \n adaptation across sectors and jurisdictions. \nThe annual re\nview and subsequent progress  \nreport will include:\n  Summary of any observ\ned changes in climate \nor impacts that occurred;\n Revie\nw of successful actions implemented;\n  R\nevie\nw barriers and amend actions to enable \nsuccessful implementation;\n  R\ne-ev\naluation of timelines as information on \nimpacts and funding is updated;\n  R\nevie\nw of other planning programs or initiatives \n that provide a window of opportunity for climate \nadaptation actions or that may be impacted by \n\nclimate change; and\n Identi˜cation of potential new funding options. \n5-Year Update: \nIt is not the intent of the update process to develop \n a new plan. \nThe updat\ne will be guided by the \nelements below:\n  \nThe updat\ne process will be carried out by a \nClimate Change Adaptation \nTeam appointed\n  by the \nDeputy City Manager and coordinated \n by Sustainability \nGroup sta˚.

Many of these low-regrets strategies produce \nco-bene˜ts, in that they address other City goals such as mitigation, sustainability, \n\nhuman well-being etc.\nRobust decision making appr\noaches: Identify decisions that are robust across the \nrange of future possibilities, even if they are not precisely optimal for any and may  \n\nbe more costly to implement. \nFlexible Design: Build for conditions now or for the next few decades but ensure  \ndesigns show cost e˚ective modi˜cations for future conditions. \nFlexible decision pathways:\n Identify a wide range of options suitable for di˚erent \nextents of change over timeframes. \nRecogniz\ne that we may require an incremental \napproach for pragmatic reasons (interaction with existing infrastructure) with the \n\nopportunity to learn and re-orient as the future unfolds. \nNested decisions:\n Incremental and short term decisions will need to be embedded \nwithin longer-term plans with key decision points or signposts identi˜ed for \n reappraisal over time.\nAdaptive management: \nAdaptation e˚orts bene˜t form an iterative or adaptive  \nmanagement approach due to the complexity, uncertainties and long time frame  \n\nassociated with climate change.\nScenario Planning:\n Combinations of structured decision-making with scenario planning \nfor di˚erent future socio-economic and climate realities can prove useful for strategic \n\ndecision-making.Vulnerability and \nRisk assessments:\n Assessments help prioritize impacts.\nRisk Management Approaches: traditional risk management approaches from the \nnatural hazard ˜eld provide frameworks for action synthesis.\nChallengeUncertainty: There ar\ne various sources of uncertainty in the information we rely on \nto plan for climate change including:\n\n- the uncertainty introduced as models attempt to model natural processes\n\n- unknown socio-economic changes that will in˛uence our vulnerability through time.\n\n- how future impacts will relate to each other and compound each other. \n\nData availability:\n data inputs traditionally used for planning at the municipal scale \nmay not be available\n- gaps in knowledge at the scale of precise local impacts\n\n- models work best with long-term trends over large areas.\nTimelines: Decision ‚lifetimes™ interact with the nature and timing of the climate change \nvariable to which the decision is sensitive. For example, a new building has a short \nlead-time in terms of design and permitting but long consequences meaning it will \n\nexperience a signi˜cant degree of climate change. \nChoosing Actions: When choosing between adaptation investments decision-makers \nface a bewildering array of potential adaptation measures, each with its own costs \nand bene˜ts, often requiring phased implementation. \nTraditional busines\ns case templates may not apply. \n33 Carmin, JoAnn, Nikhil Nadkarni, and Christopher \nRhie. 2012. \nProgress and Challenges in Urban Climate Adaptation \nPlanning: Results of a Global Survey.
