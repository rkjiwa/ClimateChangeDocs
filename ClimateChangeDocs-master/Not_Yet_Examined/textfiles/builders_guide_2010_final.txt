ICLR is an independent, not-\n\nfor-profit research institute founded by the insurance industry and affiliated with the University of \nWestern Ontario.  \nThe Institute™s mission is \nto reduce the loss of life and property caused by severe weather and \nearthquakes through the identification and support of sustained actions that improve society™s \ncapacity to adapt to, anticipate, mitigate, withstand and recover from natural disasters\n.  ICLR™s mandate is to confront the alarming increas\ne in disaster losses caused by natural disasters \nand to work to reduce disaster deaths, injuries and property damage. Disaster damage has been \n\ndoubling every five to seven years since the 1960™\ns, an alarming trend. The greatest tragedy is that \nmany disaster losses are preventable. ICLR is\n committed to the development and communication \nof disaster prevention knowledge. For the individual homeowner, this translates into the \nidentification of natural hazards that you and your home are vulnerable to. The Institute further \n\ninforms individual homeowners what steps may be fo\nllowed to better protect your family and your \nhome. \n  ', ' Designed – for safer living\n® Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction \nHome Builder™s Guide                                       June 2010 \n TABLE OF CONTENTS \n1 INTRODUCTION .......................................................................................................... 1 2 THE COMPLIANCE PROCESS ................................................................................... 3\n 3 BASEMENT FLOODING CRITERIA ............................................................................ 4\n 4 SEISMIC CRITERIA ..................................................................................................... 6\n 5 HURRICANE / TORNADO HIGH WIND CRITERIA ................................................... 12\n 6 WILDFIRE REGION CRITERIA ................................................................................. 31 7 SEVERE WINTER WEATHER CRITERIA ................................................................. 35\n 8 FLOOD REGION CRITERIA ...................................................................................... 36\n 9 HAIL REGION CRITERIA .......................................................................................... 39\n 10 OTHER PERILS ......................................................................................................... 40\n 11 REFERENCES \n........................................................................................................... 43 12 CONTACT INFORMATION ........................................................................................ 45\n  APPENDIX ‚A™  Seismic Zone Maps \nAPPENDIX ‚B™  Foundation reinforcing for seismic \n', ' Designed – for safer living\n® Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction \nHome Builder™s Guide                                       June 2010 \n  Page 1  1 INTRODUCTION  Thank you for your interest in the In\nstitute for Catastr\nophic Loss Reduction™s \nDesigned – for safer living®\n homebuilding program. The program specifies construction and design guidelines to enable homes to \nincrease their resistance to natural, catastrophe-leve\nl perils most likely to occur in the area. In addition, \nDesigned – for safer living®\n criteria exist for mitigation of damage caused by non-catastrophe-level perils, \nsuch as fire inside the home, burglary, water loss, and el\nectrical surge.  A builder is permitted to advertise a \nhouse as a \nDesigned – for safer living® \nhome following satisfactory completion of construction, product \nverification, plus other documentation as specifie\nd by the program guidelines. Final designation as a \nDesigned – for safer living®\n home is issued by an authorized, independent inspector.   \n \nBriefly, the natural, catastro\nphe-level perils addressed by the \nDesigned – for safer living®\n program are: \n  Severe Wind:\n Practically every part of Canada is subject \nto some type of severe wind hazard that can \nreadily exceed minimum requirements of even the best bu\nilding codes.  Types of severe winds include:  \n   Hurricanes:\n Catastrophic\n hurricanes can produce winds in excess of 150 mph (240 km/h). They \nare also responsible for a large portion of the cost per year damages to buildings due to wind. \nHurricanes have also resulted in deaths and injuries to residents in some coastal areas. On the \n\nimmediate coast, storm surge accounts for much of the damage. The \nDesigned – for safer living®\n program offers simple, yet effectiv\ne solutions to reduce a building™\ns vulnerability to both catastrophic \nand common hurricanes. \n  Tornadoes:\n Tornadoes can occur in specific part of t\nhe country but are most common in areas of the \ncountry where design level wind speeds in the building code are at the lowest levels.  In Canada, \n\nduring an average year, approximately 80 tornadoes \noccur and, on average, cause two deaths and 20 \ninjuries, plus tens of millions of dollars in pr\noperty damage. These are th\ne reported numbers, many \nmore tornadoes strike unpopulated areas and go\n undetected. Many build\nings would have survived \nwith only moderate improvements as featured in the \nDesigned – for safer living®\n program.   \n  Severe Thunderstorms:\n Summer thunderstorms are a fairly common occurrence in most areas of \nCanada.\n  Thunderstorms not only spawn tornadoes, but \ncan also produce damaging winds of 112 mph \n(180 km/h) gust or more. Downbursts, which are al\nso associated with thunderstorms, can produce \ntornado-like damage. Hail is also a hazard asso\nciated with thunderstorms and causes significant \ndamage to the exteriors of thous\nands of buildings each year. The \nDesigned – for safer living®\n program provides improved resistance to these \nhazards associated with severe thunderstorms.  \n  Earthquakes:\n Unlike wind, earthquakes come with no warning. There is little opportunity to take cover or \nvacate an unsafe building. In places like the West \nCoast, design level earthquakes may occur several times \nin a lifetime. In other parts of \nthe country, moderate earthquakes occu\nr with less frequency, but have \nhappened in the not so distant past in several region\ns. Earthquakes are often \nthe cause of significant \ndamage and injury because it is ﬁunexpectedﬂ. Eart\nhquake hazard zones in Canada are shown in a map \nattached to Appendix ‚A™ of the Guideline. The \nDesigned – for safer living®\n program addresses this \nsignificant and sometimes uncertain hazard with easily implemented solutions. \n  Floods: Buildings built in the inland or coastal 100-yr flood plain are in serious jeopardy of complete loss in \nthe event of a flood. For this reason, significant meas\nures are necessary to protect buildings from this \npotential hazard. Therefore, the \nDesigned – for safer living®\n program only applies to buildings that \ncomply with the strictest condition in the \nfloodfringe zone\n when building is permitted in these areas.  \n Wildfires: Every year, and even more so in recent years,\n wildfires have threatened and destroyed hundreds \nof buildings and lives. While some wildfires are natura\nlly ignited from lightening or other causes, many are \n', ' Designed – for safer living\n® Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction \nHome Builder™s Guide                                       June 2010 \n  Page 2  the result of carelessness or arson. Simple site \ndesign, material usage and landscape features of the \nDesigned – for safer living®\n program can protect a home against this increasingly widespread hazard.   \n  Severe Winter Weather:\n The majority of the regions in Canada \nare subjected to extreme weather pattern \nthat causes severe damage to structure from heavy snow and cold. The \nDesigned – for safer living®\n program provides practical protection for homes from the damaging effects of this hazard.  \n Building Code Requirements  \n Building codes set a baseline of performance for many features within the home. While the \nDesigned – for \nsafer living®\n program requires many items above and beyond building code requirements in terms of \nnatural disaster resistance, it is \nstill crucial that the home meet mini\nmum requirements rega\nrding structural system, electrical, mechanical, plumbing, weatheriza\ntion, life and safety, and interior fire protection \nmeasures.    The National Building Code of Canada (NBCC) sets \nout the minimum requirements addressing safety, health \naccessibility and building protection. In addition, there ar\ne several other national codes such as the Plumbing \nCode, Electrical Code, and National Fire Code of \nCanada provides guidance and requirements for applicable \nsystems in the building. Today most\n provinces and territories have pas\nsed legislation adopting either the \nnational model building, fire and plumbing codes or variat\nions that include provincial additions, exemptions, \nor amendments.  Provinces and territories have also\n established systems of planning and development \nreview that affect what can be built, generally with a la\nrge municipal role. Provincial and territorial laws for \nthe environment, flood control, seismic \nhazard, occupational health and safety\n, etc. can also affect planning, \nconstruction and operation of buildings. In order to ensure that all \nDesigned – for safer living®\n homes receive an adequate minimum level of protection consistent with national and local building code \n\nrequirements, homes built in some regions of the c\nountry must be inspected by a registered architect or \nprofessional engineer to certify that the home meets all \napplicable requirements of a specific model building \ncode.  \n\n \nStatement of Land Use Policy \n \nThe Designed – for safer living®\n program will be governed by local and municipal by-laws and zoning \ncriteria concerning where it is deemed safe to build re\nsidential structures, except as follows: coastal regions \nsubject to tidal surge and flooding, close proximity to known seismic fault lines, close proximity to major \nlevees, and steep slopes potentially subj\nect to either erosion or wildfire. \n Natural Disasters Œ Adjusted for inflation 2006 ($000) 1998 Quebec/Ontario Icestorm 1,961,658\n2005 Ontario Wind/Rainstorm509,813\n2005 Alberta Flooding 305,888\n1996 Saguenay, Quebec Flooding 254,230\n1993 Winnipeg Flooding 235,581\n2003 British Columbia Forest Fires 212,257\n1996 Winnipeg Flood/Hailstorm180,187\n2004 Edmonton Hailstorm 172,976\n2000 Ontario Storm 146,520\n1996 Calgary Hailstorm 146,151\n1999 Ontario Snowstorm 140,951\n2003 Nova Scotia Hurricane 140,802\n', ' Designed – for safer living\n® Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction \nHome Builder™s Guide                                       June 2010 \n  Page 3   2 THE COMPLIANCE PROCESS \n The process starts with a plan review. Following sa\ntisfactory completion of construction, inspection \nchecklists, product verification and/or other\n documentation, final designation as a \nDesigned – for safer \nliving® home is issued by ICLR.    \n \nNote that an ICLR Certified Inspector \nmust verify that materials, installation, construction, and building \ntechniques meet program criteria for the location.  \n  \nInspectors will meet with the builder prior to construction to discuss the appropriate criteria and review the \nbuilding plans. The intent of this step is to set the \nstage for most of the field inspections. The inspector will \nreview the drawings for all relevant criteria and comm\nunicate the requirements of the program to the builder.  \nIn order to effectively complete the drawing review, t\nhe builder will need to supply the following information:  \n  Architectural drawings showing floor plans and elevations.      \n Window/Door schedule.  \n Structural drawings (if applicable).  \n Base Flood Elevation (if applicable).  \n Truss drawings from the truss manufacturer.  \n Documentation on wall and roof sheathing, fastening \nschedules and roof covering materials used.  \n The inspector will visit the site appr\noximately four (4) times during the co\nnstruction of the building to verify \ncompliance to the \nDesigned – for safer living®\n standards. After the last inspection, the builder or \nhomebuyer will receive a certificate from\n ICLR designating compliance with the \nDesigned – for safer \nliving® program.  (Figure 1-1). \n For additional details, please contact the ICLR program staff listed in Section 17. \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Figure 1-1:  Sample of Designed – for safer living®\n Certificate ', ' Designed – for safer living\n® Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction \nHome Builder™s Guide                                       June 2010 \n  Page 4   3 BASEMENT FLOODING CRITERIA \n Basement Flooding caused by Urban Flooding \n During heavy rainfall or snowmelt events, almost any home can be vulnerable to flooding including those \nlocated outside of the floodplain (see \nFlood Region Criteria \nsection).  Basement flooding generally has three \ncauses:  Overland flooding, infiltration flooding and sewer backup.   \n Overland flooding can occur during extreme rainfall or\n snowmelt events, where \nstormwater flows onto \nprivate property.  This water can enter homes\n through basement windows, doors, vents and other \nopenings including reverse sloped driveways.   \n Infiltration flooding occurs when the soil arou\nnd the home™s foundation becomes saturated with \ngroundwater, or when the groundwater level exce\neds the height of the basement floor.  Groundwater \ncan then infiltrate into the basement through \ncracks in foundation walls and basement floors. \n Sewer backup originates from the municipal stormw\nater or sanitary sewer system and can occur when \nunderground sewer systems surcharge due to high water volumes in the system.  When underground \nsewer systems surcharge, sewage can backup into hom\ne sewer connections, which can result in water \nand sewage backing up into the home through plumbing \nfixtures or backing up into the foundation drain \ncausing possible structural damage to the home.   \n \nTo reduce the risk of sewer backup, ensure that the \nhome is isolated from the m\nunicipal sewer system, to \nthe extent possible.  This may include: \n- Severance of sanitary sewer connectio\nns, to the extent possible, including: \no Installation of an open-port, mainline sanitary sewer backwater valve on the main \nsanitary sewer lateral.  The installation must meet manufacturer™s and municipal \nguidance for such devices, including proper\n placement of the valve on the sanitary \nlateral. Installation of the backwater valve mu\nst also meet national, provincial and local \nbuilding code requirements.  Installation of a backwater valve will require proper \n\ndisconnection of weeping tiles and eavestrough downspouts from the home™s sanitary \nsewer connection. Inspect and confirm that t\nhe backwater valve is in good working order \non an annual basis; \n- Severance of storm sewer connections, to\n the extent possible.  This includes: \no Drainage of weeping tiles into a sump pit, and then using a sump pump to pump \nfoundation drain discharge to the \nsurface of the lot.  This practice must meet municipal \nguidelines for pumping foundation drainage to \nthe surface of the lo\nt, where appropriate, \nincluding proper extensions to keep discha\nrges away from the foundation. Inspect and \nclean pump and pit on annual basis, and; \no Disconnection of eavestrough downspouts, in\ncluding proper extensions and splash pads \nextended away from the foundation walls.  \n \nTo reduce the risk of overland flooding and infiltra\ntion flooding, the following actions may be taken: \n- Proper lot grading: \no The lot must be graded to meet municipal lot grading guidelines including placement of \nappropriate swales; \no Installation of window wells for windows close to ground level where appropriate, and \ninstallation of covers on the window wells; \no Proper backfilling, including capping backfill ar\nea with a soil that has a low porosity, for \nexample, clay; \n- Disconnection of eavestrough do\nwnspouts, including proper ex\ntensions and splash pads \nextended away from the foundation walls.  Water \nmay also be directed into a rain barrel, \nprovided that proper overflow ext\nensions are provided with the rain barrel and the rain barrel is \ninstalled based on manufacturer™s instructions; \n- Do not install reverse sloped driveways, and; \n', ' Designed – for safer living\n® Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction \nHome Builder™s Guide                                       June 2010 \n  Page 5  - Reduce the amount of hard surfaces on a lot, to the extent possible, and include ﬁsoftﬂ \nlandscaping where appropriate, incl\nuding vegetated areas and gardens. \n \nMandatory Actions to Reduce Basement Flood Risk:\n  In many cases, municipal governments have ca\nrried out detailed engineering studies on the \ncauses of urban flooding in their jurisdiction.  Investigate whether such studies have been \nconducted, and integrate the findings into the \nhome/lot design. Also, ensure that any guidance \nand regulations on reduction of basement flooding\n available from the municipal government are \nintegrated into the home/lot design; \n- Do not install reverse sloped driveways; \n- Lot grading must meet municipal guidelines, including proper backfilling; \n- Drainage of eavestrough downspout\ns and foundation drains to the surface of the lot, based on \nmunicipal guidelines; \n- Proper disconnection of the foundation dr\nain from the home™s sewer connections, and \ninstallation of a sump-pit and sump-pump to discharge water to the lot™s surface, based on \nmunicipal guidelines.  A backup sump-pump that can run when the main pump fails or during a \nblackout should also be installed, and; \n- Ensure home is isolated from the municipal se\nwer system(s), to the extent possible, where the \nmunicipality permits. \n Highly recommended, but not mandatory:\n - Installation of an open-port backwater \nvalve on the sanitary sewer lateral; \n- Reduce the amount of hard surfaces on the lot; \n- Foundation walls waterproofing membrane; \n- Installation of warning devices such as alarms to detect high water level in the sump-pit or \nmalfunction of the sump-pump, and; \n- Selection of moisture resistant flooring and wall finishes in the basement. \n', ' Designed – for safer living\n® Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction \nHome Builder™s Guide                                       June 2010 \n  Page 6  4 SEISMIC CRITERIA \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Introduction  \nHomes are engineered for the loads placed on them by building materials and environmental forces. The \n\nseismic forces are rarely experienced, but can be a thr\neat to structural integrity and the survival of the \nequipment and contents in the home.  Seismic forces \nact on all building components, unlike wind loads that \nprimarily impact on the external envelop. Neverthel\ness, many design details relating to inter-storey \nconnections and foundation anchoring, enhance a building™\ns capacity to resist earthquake and wind load, \nand these are covered in Section 3 on Wind Criteria a\nnd not repeated here.  The seismic criteria of the \nDesigned – for safer living\n® program are selected to produce a home, which resists and sometimes \ndissipates seismic forces in order to minimize\n damage to the building structure and systems.  \n \nAdvanced Engineering Design \nMost single family and small multi-family dwellings are \nbuilt under Part 9 of the provincial version of the \nNational Building Code of Canada (NBCC).  Seismic crit\neria are incorporated into the various structural \nrequirements.  However, for homes with more comple\nx shapes or structural elements, which may affect \nbuilding performance under seismic loading, the builder\n is directed from Part 9 to Part 4 of the Code. \n It is in Part 4, that seismic force calculations fo\nr more complex structures are located.  While the \nDesigned \n... for safer living® home may not always require significant additional structural strengthening following \nPart 4 analysis, it provides the basis fo\nr producing a higher performance home.  \n Part 4 lateral force calculations include an Importance Factor (I\nE) multiplier, which for a standard home is 1.0.  \nDesigned ... for safer living\n® homes have an increased Importance Factor of 1.2, which compares with the \nCode designations of 1.3 for schools and 1.5 for ho\nspitals and other strategic facilities.  These higher \nclassifications produce a building, which is designed to have reduced risk of damage and the ability to \nremain occupied during period following most earthquakes. Some building elements may be strengthened, \nconnectors somewhat more numerous and anchors wi\nth occasionally deeper embedments. The use of Part \n4 allows for a wide variety of home designs, while producing enhanced seismic performance.  \n ', ' Designed – for safer living\n® Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction \nHome Builder™s Guide                                       June 2010 \n  Page 7  An Engineer on the Team \nEach home construction project under the \nDesigned ... for safer living ® program has a Structural Engineer \nof Record (SER).  This assures the prospective buyer \nthat a registered professional\n is overseeing their home \nconstruction. It further makes available to the builder a \nreadily accessible resource for use as issues arise \nand it may eliminate the need for Code authority inspecti\nons in some provinces.  At the end of construction \nand final review, documentation is issued attesting to compliance of the home with the \nDesigned ... for safer living® program.      \n \nBuilt for Performance There are two main ways that buildings are built to co\nnstruction codes.  The most common is the prescriptive \napproach, where a single level of performance is se\nlected and then detailed engineering descriptive \nspecifications and tables are generated to produce the \ndesired results.  A new field of performance-based \nengineering has been introduced recently.  It allows \nfor a number of calculated performance options. By \nusing Part 4 of the Code as well as Part 9, these opt\nions become available, which are more suitable to \nunique characteristics of the home and the desired re\nsult with respect to damage limitation following an \nearthquake.  \n     \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n  Protecting the Most Important Asset \nThe National Building Code of Canada is designed to protect the lives of building occupants from a wide \n\narray of hazards, including an earthquake.  From a seismi\nc point of view, the Code aims to avoid structural \ncollapse and the loss of life that may result from st\nrong ground motion.  The current dominant system of \nwood frame construction produces a home, which has gen\nerally been shown to have a low rate of structural \nfailure during earthquakes.  \n \nHowever, a home that adheres to the building code ca\nn experience significant damage. A home is the single \nlargest asset most people possess.  It also represents a \nstrong sense of security.  Anything that threatens \nsignificant damage to one™s home is of considerable concern.  \n\n The significant value of a home indicates that simp\nly building for life safety is not enough for many \nCanadians. The potential damage that will still result is\n no longer acceptable to many.  The costs associated \nwith the damage to the home and possible loss of use for long periods is always born partially by the \nhomeowner.  Because of the regional nature of the im\npact of an earthquake, recovery is expensive due to \ndemand-based inflation and the ability to find suitable temporary hou\nsing may be limited.  It is therefore more \nimportant than ever before, to reduce the risk and ther\nefore cost of earthquake damage, by making some \nrelatively small, but strategic improvemen\nts during the construction of a new home. \n', ' Designed – for safer living\n® Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction \nHome Builder™s Guide                                       June 2010 \n  Page 8   The Engineering Design Process \nThe NBCC specifies where earthquake \nmeasures are required in homes with seismic hazard charts (see \nAppendix A).  A Designed ... for safer living\n® home complies with those requirements.  However, because \nPart 4 of the Code is used, soil types and special site conditions such as sloping terrain are also taken into \naccount during the design process.  Local zoning regulati\nons often ignore difficult site conditions, which can \nthen be dealt with during the design process.  \n\n During the design engineering process, seismic force ca\nlculations may be  generated at various locations in \nthe home, for various building components, based on the procedure found in Part 4 of the Code and \n\nsupporting appendices.     \n With the Designed ... for safer living® home, the builder has the support\n of an experienced engineer when \nneeded throughout the construction process.  This ca\nn speed the building schedule and eliminate costly \ndelays and changes.  Because the engineer is involved \nfrom the beginning, design changes can quickly be \naccommodated.  From a marketing point of view, the engineered, \nDesigned ... for safer living®\n home assures quality control during construction and a certified product on completion.  \n Flexible Quality Design \nBecause each \nDesigned ... for safer living® home is built under Part 4 of the Code, virtually any desired \ndesign can be analysed and the necessary details added, in\n order to meet the requirements of the program.  \nOccasional economic tradeoffs may be required, al\nthough most can be eliminated through innovative design \nand engineering.  \n As the Designed ... for safer living® home runs ahead of current general construction practice, it should \nappeal to buyers, as it is more likely to hold its value.  \n\n \n Seismic Forces and Building Response \n\n    \n   \n   \n   \n    \n \n \n \n \n ', ' Designed – for safer living\n® Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction \nHome Builder™s Guide                                       June 2010 \n  Page 9  Earthquake waves generate ground acceleration in horiz\nontal and vertical directions, which try to push the \nhome, causing it to \nSLIDE off the foundation.  This is a \nSHEAR force or base shear, applied in a horizontal \nplane at the foundation level.  Effective anchor\ning and connectors avoid separation failure. \n    \n   \n     \n \n   \n  These same forces also threaten the home with \nOVERTURNING\n.  This translates into vertical uplift and \ntensioning of the anchors on the side \nnearest the incoming waves.  At the same time, the opposite side of \nthe structure experiences compression.  Once agai\nn, the anchors and connectors get a workout as the \nbuilding experiences overturning forces. \n\n   \n     \n   \n   \n  Wood frame buildings are typically more flexible than ma\nsonry or concrete structures.  They are a bit like a \nfly fishing rod with the energy traveling up the build\ning with a frequency, which causes the floors and roof \narea to displace differently from each other and the foundation.  This phenomenon is called \nRACKING\n and \nresults in DRIFT\n, which buildings are designed to to\nlerate it within limits. This flexibility can actually dissipate \nseismic energy, relieving stress on key connection points\n. If drift becomes excessive, an out-of-plane failure \ncan occur.  Drift in a building is calculated and stiffne\nss in the form of shear walls or bracing can be added to \nremedy an identified problem such as a ﬁsoft storey,ﬂ \nwhere a weak floor with large openings for a garage or \nwindows represents an unnec\nessary seismic risk.  \n', ' Designed – for safer living\n® Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction \nHome Builder™s Guide                                       June 2010 \n  Page 10    \n     \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \nBuildings are engineered for dead and live loads of t\nhe building materials and contents. A design develops \nalignments, so that the weight is \neffectively transferred down through the structure to a solid foundation on \nstable soil.  This is called a \nLOAD PATH\n and effective design of its many routes is critical to seismic \nperformance.  This results in the development of seis\nmic force resisting systems (SFRS), which help protect \nthe home from excessive damage during strong ground mo\ntion.  Care must be taken to achieve the ﬁsweet \nspotﬂ between a structure, which is too flexible and \nprone to out-of-plane damage and one, which is too stiff \nand places undue stress on connection points.             \n The House You Want AND Seismic Performance \nInteresting and unusual design does not preclude improved seismic performance.  Large window openings, \nasymmetrical floor plans, cantilevered overhangs, un\nusual weight loading and excessively open interior \nspaces present engineering challenges and may in\ncrease costs, but can all be accommodated in a \nDesigned ... for safer living\n® home.

Apply a bead of sealant to outside of top mount\ning flange and then install 9ﬂ (225mm) wide flashing \noverlapping nailing flange.   \n2. Head flashing must cover top edge of jamb fl\nashing and should extend a minimum of 9ﬂ (225mm) \npast side jambs of window.   \n Step 5: Weather Resistant Barrier  \n1. Install weather resistant barrier\n consisting of house wrap or building paper in weather board fashion \nstarting from base of the wall and working upward.   \n2. The first course of weather \nresistant barrier should be tucked \nup under the sill and loose ends of \njamb flashing.  Attach sill a\nnd jamb flashing to barrier.   \n3.

Passive protection means t\nhat the window or door can withstand wind-borne \ndebris without any external protection; i.e., shutters\n or screens.

In this case the double hung windows would need to meet a DP of 50, but \nnot need impact protection.    \n \nWhen one examines a double door, or a double slider, the rough opening of the unit should be \nconsidered.

Most localities in Canada are subject to Severe \nWinter Weather Conditions. The National Building of\n Canada (NBCC) provides design weather data for \nselected locations including temperature, snow and ra\nin fall, wind speed, etc. In addition to the NBCC, \nhomebuilder must consult with local authorities for applicable municipal codes and their requirements. The \nDesigned – for safer living®\n criteria for Severe Weather is bas\ned on the requirements of the NBCC and \nhomebuilder must met these minimum criteria.  \n Mandatory Requirements\n:  1. Unless already included because of other risks, an additional moisture barrier shall be applied to the \nroof deck along the eaves of the roof to\n prevent intrusion caused by ice dams. \n2. All drains on flat roofs shall hav\ne heating strips (heat trace) installed around them in such a way that \nit prevents blockage of the drains by ice or ice dams. \n3. No heat source shall be installed in un-conditioned attic space. \n\n4. No un-insulated recessed lights shall be installed. \n5. All attic doors between conditi\noned and un-conditioned space shall be treated as exterior doors, \nproperly insulated, sealed and \nweather-stripped or gasketed. \n6. All hidden attic penetrations (stack vents, partiti\non walls, electrical chases, etc.) shall be properly \nsealed and insulated. \n7. Frozen Pipes:   \na) Option 1: Require sufficient insulation on all exterior piping and on all piping in exterior walls, \ncrawl spaces, attics, and basement ceilings.   \nb) Option 2: Prohibit pipes in external walls and unheated spaces.   \n Designed – for safer living®\n homes located in areas within the fr\neezing weather criteria boundary shall \ninclude the following requirements in add\nition to those of other perils:  \n Roof Requirements  \n\n An additional moisture barrier shall be applied along the eaves of the roof to prevent water intrusion caused \nby ice dams. This shall consist of a self-adher\ning polymer modified bitumen membrane meeting ASTM \nD1970. The moisture barrier must extend from the eave™s\n edge to at least 24ﬂ (600mm) past the exterior wall \nline. Where roof valleys exist, the additional moisture \nbarrier shall extend up the ent\nire length of the roof \nvalley and be a minimum of 36ﬂ (900mm) in width. This additional ice dam protection is not necessary in \ncases where a self-adhering polymer modified bitumen \nmembrane is applied over the entire surface of the \nroof deck.  \n Attic Requirements  \n Specifically, severe winter w\neather attic requirements are: \n 1. No heat sources shall be installed in unconditioned attic space (i.e., ductwork, etc).  \n2. No un-insulated recessed lights.  \n3.

After a flood, governments and \ninsurance firms are often faced with providing \nemergency assistance, clean-up, remediation and \ncompensation to affected residents and businesses.  \n  In Canada, flood requirements were originally establis\nhed in 1975 as part of the Flood Damage Reduction \nProgram (FDRP) where urban and coastal flood prone lands were mapped based on one hundred-year or \n\ngreater floods. The program encouraged provincial \nand municipal governments to enact site specific \nfloodplain regulations in order to regionalize and mitigat\ne future development on the designated lands. Flood \ninformation maps are available for flood risk areas. Wi\nth the implementation of this program, provinces and \nmunicipalities discouraged development on the designated \nflood risk areas. Depending on the locality, there \nwere more stringent regulations based on historic flood\n data. Some minimum requirements practiced in flood \nrisk zones are outlined below:  \n\n 1. A minimum of 1 foot (0.3m) freeboard above the first floor entry for a 1 in 100 year flood event.\n 2. Flood proofing procedures including sealing all \nopenings below floodline, surrounding the building \nwith floodproof masonry or concrete walls or berms, using one-way valves for sewer systems and \ninstallation of electrical, communication and mechanical systems above the flood line. \n  Figure 4-1: Map Location of Floods in Canada 1900-1997 \n\n(Sourcehttp://tsdmaps.gsc.nrcan.gc.c\na/website/_floods/floods_e.htm). \nNotes  1) the symbols depict the general location of a given event and in some case, the affected \n\narea was substantially larger than the symbol;  \n2) light symbols represent a single event \n& dark symbols represent multiple events. \n  ', ' Designed – for safer living\n® Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction \nHome Builder™s Guide                                       June 2010 \n  Page 37  Floodplains \n A floodplain is defined as the land submerged by a \none hundred year or larger flood. The floodplain is \ndivided into two key areas: the \nfloodway\n and \nflood fringe. The floodway is designated as a high risk flood \nhazard and flood fringe is designated as a chance of flood occurrences (see Figure 4-1). \n   Figure 4-2:  Illustration of floodplain \nand flood fringe (Environment Canada website, \nFloods, 3 Feb. 2009) \n Generally provincial and municipal land use policies direct\n new buildings and land uses to areas that are not \nat a high risk of flooding. In lower risk areas, develop\nment needs to be of a design and with an appropriate \nlevel of protection to ensure that the risk of damag\ne from flooding is minimized. Any development within a \nflood risk area should not impede water flows or exacerbate flood risk elsewhere.  \n \nIt is the prime responsibility of the property owner \nto avoid development in areas of flood risk and, in \ninstances where development already\n exists or is permitted, to undertake appropriate flood proofing. \nProvincial regulations and municipal zoning by-law\ns and all other agencies with development control \nauthority are responsible for strictly controlling devel\nopment in line with land use policies and for ensuring \nthat all owners and users of property are aware of t\nhe risks of developing in an area that is subject to \nflooding. These regulations vary with each location and generally depend on the flood risk.  \n The ICLR flood requirements are, in general, follows the provincial and municipal guidelines and policies: \n\n 1. flood proofing means structural \nand/or non-structural measures incorporated in the design of a \nbuilding or structure which reduce or eliminate t\nhe risk of flood damage by ensuring that the ground \nfloor elevation is higher than the projected flo\nod level and that the building can be exited without \nhindrance in the event of a flood. \n', ' Designed – for safer living\n® Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction \nHome Builder™s Guide                                       June 2010 \n  Page 38  2. floodway means the inner portion of a flood risk area\n where the risk of flood is greatest, on average \nonce in twenty years, and where the flood depths and water velocities are greatest.\n 3. floodway fringe means the outer portion of a fl\nood risk area, between the floodway and the outer \nboundary of the flood risk area, where the risk of \nflooding is lower, on average once in one hundred \nyears, and flood waters are shallower and slower. \n \nThe flood risk areas mapped under the Flood Damage R\neduction Program are generally available at local \nmunicipalities: \n 1. Within a floodway: new residential devel\nopment is restricted to non-building uses. \n2. Within a floodway fringe: new buildings and st\nructures, provided they are floodproofed, may be \npermitted.  \n Under the \nDesigned– for safer living®\n program, the following requirements \nmust\n be met:  Mandatory Requirements: \n\n 1. The building must comply with all of the prov\nisions of the provincial and municipal building \nregulations for construction in flood risk zones. \n2. The minimum elevation of the botto\nm of the lowest habitable floor s\nhall comply with local regulations. \nWhere local regulations are not avail\nable, it shall not be the greater of: \na) 3\n feet (1m) above the base flood elevation (BFE); \nb) 1.2 times the flood elevation \nin floodway fringe zones; or,  \nc) 1-ft (0.3m) above the 500 year flood elevation (if known). \n3. For BFE or flood height of 15 feet (5m) or less\n, the 3 feet (1m) limit would apply; otherwise the \nfreeboard would be 1.2 times the BFE or flood hei\nght.  Preference would be to use 1-ft above the \n500 year flood elevation if it \nis known or can be determined. \n Building Requirements  \n 1. Foundation\n: The design, height and type of foundation to \nbe used on homes built in areas within the \nflood fringe zones must comply with the requirements \nof the local planning authorities. If there are no \nregulations available, the following requirements shall be adhered to as minimum:   \na) Homes in Non- flood fringe zones must \nbe designed and constructed with the lowest \nhabitable floor (including basements) above the \nBase Flood Elevation (BFE) by at least 2 ft \n(0.6m).  Community records or a licensed \nsurvey are required to determine the BFE. \nb) Homes in flood fringe zones must be cons\ntructed on open foundation (including elevated-\nenclosed with breakaway walls) with continuous\n piles. The bottom of the lowest horizontal \nsupport member must be above the BFE by at least 2 ft (0.6m). Verify with local building \nplanning authorities for other allowable foundat\nion types such as crawlspaces with flood \nvents.    2. Utilities: Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing,\n air conditioning equipment and other service \nfacilities must be elevated above the BFE by at leas\nt 2 ft (0.6m) in flood fringe zones. Builders must \nverify with local planning authorities for site specif\nic regulations with regards to utilities in flood risk \nareas. \n \n ', ' Designed – for safer living\n® Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction \nHome Builder™s Guide                                       June 2010 \n  Page 39   9 HAIL REGION CRITERIA \n Hail can be extremely dangerous and can ca\nuse extensive damage to property.  \n \nSite Requirement \n \nAtmospheric Environment Service (AES\n), Environment Canada, classified Regions in Canada with the most \nfrequent hail are the central and eastern prairies (p\narts of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba), south-\ncentral British Columbia and southwestern Ontario.\n Central and Eastern Canada generally have frequencies \nbelow 1 hail day per year. Canadian hail climatology maps are available and they are generally used to help \nidentify vulnerable regions, and thus areas wher\ne mitigation efforts should be concentrated \n \nMandatory Requirements: \n Install an impact resistant roof covering Œ UL 2218 Cl\nass 4 or FM 4473 Class 4.  (Note that UL test is \ndesigned for flexible roof covering products, and the FM\n test is designed for rigid roof covering products).  \nThis is the only criterion for Hail regions.  \n 1. UL 2218 is a test that is administered by Unde\nrwriters Laboratories and involves dropping steel balls \nof varying sizes from heights designed to simulate\n the energy of falling hailstones. Roofing products \nreceiving a score of 1, referred \nto as Class 1, are most likely to be damaged during a hailstorm, \nwhile products receiving a Class 4 rating are expe\ncted to provide the greatest protection from hail \nimpact. Class 4 indicates that the product was still f\nunctional after being stru\nck twice in the same \nspot by 2ﬂ (50mm) steel balls\n.  For instance, a standard wood-shake shingle, because of its \nsusceptibility to hail damage, may \nreceive a Class-1 UL rating, \nwhile a polymer-modified asphalt \nshingle or concrete tile may receive a Class 4 rati\nng. It is therefore possible to design and construct \na roof that is nearly resistant to hail damage wi\nth the right combination of a high-quality shingle \nproduct, a thin layer of underlayment and rigid deck\ning material all installed on a well-pitched roof.  \n Examine the package of the roof cover product, or\n consult manufacturer documentation to determine \nif the product has met the Class 4 designation \nof UL 2218. If difficultly is encountered locating \nproducts that meet UL 2218 Class 4, contact the \nDesigned – for safer living®\n program manager \nat ILRC for a list of approved roof covering produc\nts. Note that this standard is appropriate for \nflexible roofing products like asphalt shingles, and metal panels or shingles.  \n  2. FM 4473 is administered by Factory Mutual Resear\nch and is a test that is similar to UL 2218, but \ninstead of using steel balls, frozen ice balls are us\ned. The FM 4473 test standard is used on rigid \nroof covering materials (like cement tiles) and involv\nes firing the ice balls from a sling or air cannon \nat the roof-covering product.  Cla\nss 4 indicates that\n the product was still functi\nonal after being struck \ntwice in the same spot by a 2ﬂ (25mm) ice ball.  \n  ', ' Designed – for safer living\n® Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction \nHome Builder™s Guide                                       June 2010 \n  Page 40   10 OTHER PERILS \n INTERNAL FIRE CRITERIA \n Designed – for safer living®\n criteria have been developed for mitigat\nion of damage caused by fire inside \nthe home.
