Globally, international assessments continue to identify rising \n \nair and ocean temperatures, shifting precipitation patterns, shrinking glaciers, declining snow cover and sea ice extent, rising \n \nsea level and changes in extreme events (IPCC, 2013). While rates of change vary from one indicator to another, the directions \n \nof change are consistent with climate warming, and climate models project that many of the observed trends will continue \n \nover the coming decades and beyond. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs; mitigation) is necessary to lessen the \n\nmagnitude and rate of climate change, but additional impacts are unavoidable, even with aggressive global mitigation e˜orts, \n\ndue to inertia in the climate system. Therefore, we also need to adapt Œ make adjustments in our activities and decisions in \n \norder to reduce risks, moderate harm or take advantage of new opportunities. All levels of government, researchers, the private \n\nsector and non-government organizations now view adaptation as an essential complement to mitigation.\nIn 2008, the Government of Canada released a national-scale science assessment of climate change impacts and adaptation \n(From Impacts to Adaptation: Canada in a Changing Climate\n). That assessment used a regional approach to discuss current and \nfuture climate change impacts and vulnerabilities in Canada, as well as adaptation options. It built upon the ˚ndings of Canada™s \n\n˚rst national-scale assessment (The Canada Country Study\n, 1998) and drew conclusions from all available relevant literature.\nThis report Œ \nCanada in a Changing Climate: Sector Perspectives on Impacts and Adaptation\n Œ is an update to the 2008 assessment. \nIt focuses on new information and knowledge, assessing advances made in understanding climate change impacts and \n\nadaptation from a sectoral perspective, based primarily on literature published up to the end of 2012. This synthesis draws from \n\nthe individual chapters of the report, which include an overview of Canada™s changing climate \n(Ch. 2), \nthematic chapters focused \n\non sect\nors (Ch. \n3 to \n8) and the concluding chapter on adaptation research and practice \n(Ch. 9). \nThe key ˚ndings of chapters 3 \nto 9 are summarized in \nBox 1\n. The rest of the synthesis is structured around high-level conclusions, supported by examples and \n\ninsights from an integrative analysis across the report themes\n1.  1    This Synthesis does not repeat the references provided in the underlying chapters, but rather directs the reader to individual chapters of the report where speci˚c references can be \n\nfound.  Occasional speci˚c ref\nerences are included when the source was not cited within another chapter or to provide additional context.\n', 'Synthesis\n     3BOX 1\nKEY FINDINGS FROM THE CHAPTERS\nNatural Resources (Forestry, Energy and Mining, Chapter 3)\nClimate change will exacerbate existing climate risks related to the planning and management of natural resources.\nThese risks relate to impacts and natural hazards associated with climate extremes (e.g. heat, cold, precipitation)\nand to g\nradual changes, such as permafrost degradation, sea level rise, and plant species migration.  Climate\nchange will also present new opportunities for the natural resource sectors, particularly in relation to northern\n\neconomic development.\nConsideration of multiple stressors is critical to understanding adaptation in the natural resource sectors.  Climate\n\nchange itself is rarely identi˜ed as a priority concern, with industry focused on other immediate stressors, such as\n\neconomic drivers. Opportunities exist to integrate consideration of climate change into current planning processes.\nEnvironmental assessment, risk disclosure, and sustainable forest management reporting are examples of processes\n\nthat can help advance adaptation actions.  These processes allow governments, investors and the public to evaluate\n\nindustry understanding of changing climate risks and in˚uence the steps taken to address those risks.\nWhile awareness of climate change impacts and implementation of adaptation actions is most evident in\n\nsectors where there is a clear and direct relationship between climate and resource supply, notably forestry and\n\nhydroelectricity, the application of adaptive management approaches to address climate change impacts is seen\n\nacross all natural resource sectors.\nFood Production (Chapter 4)\nThe impacts of climate change di˛er signi˜cantly between agriculture, ˜sheries, and non-commercial food supply,\n\nbut common challenges include increased losses from invasive pests and diseases, and risks to transportation\n\nsystems upon which the sectors rely.\nThe net medium-term outlook is for a likely modest increase in agricultural food production. Longer and warmer\n\ngrowing seasons would allow higher-value warmer-weather crops to be grown further north (where soil\n\nconditions permit), lengthen outdoor feeding seasons for livestock, and allow the maple syrup industry to expand\n\nnorthward. However, there will likely be new pests and diseases, as well as more severe outbreaks of current ones,\n\nand challenges associated with extreme weather events and the reduced predictability of inter-annual weather\n\nvariability that could negatively a˛ect production.\nNorthern and remote communities are likely to see great changes in their environment Œ some will ease food\n\nsecurity concerns, while others could exacerbate already decreasing country food stocks and di˝culties in\n\ndelivering supplies into isolated areas.\nCanada is expected to remain a net exporter of aquatic foods at the aggregate level, with total biomass of\n\nproduction from wild, capture ˜sheries in Canada expected to increase due to climate-induced shifts in ˜sh\n\ndistributions. Regional impacts from invading species, physical habitat changes and societal responses to shifts\n\nin availability and access to aquatic food resources will gradually determine future patterns of use and overall\n\neconomic implications.\nAquaculture has a greater scope for adaptation to climate change than other ˜sheries, making it less vulnerable and\n\nbetter positioned to take advantage of opportunities than capture ˜sheries, and subsistence ˜sheries in particular.\nBox 1 continued on next page\n', '4       Canada in a Changing Climate: Sector Perspectives on Impacts and Adaptation\nIndustry (Chapter 5)\nIndustrial activity is sensitive to variations in weather and in extreme events, with considerable di˛erences in the types\nand extent of impacts on production, operations, and revenue among and within sectors.\nChanges in industry practices have been predominantly reactive, responding to variation in the weather or extreme\n\nevents, rather than proactive anticipation of future climate change. Examples of adaptation tend to be isolated rather\n\nthan representative of a clear trend within the sector.\nAdaptive actions implemented by industry vary by sector, and may be under-reported for strategic reasons.  Relative\nto other sectors, tourism and insurance show the most promise in using adaptive actions to take advantage of\npotential opportunities.\nThere is little published research about indirect impacts of climate change on industry, such as changes associated\n\nwith consumer demand, supply chains, real estate or other assets, adaptation by other sectors, legal liability or\n\ngovernment regulation.\nBarriers towards e˛ective adaptation include limited information on local impacts to businesses, uncertainties about\n\nthe costs and bene˜ts of di˛erent adaptive actions, and limited market demand for the implementation of adaptation.\nBiodiversity and Protected Areas (Chapter 6) \nClimate-related shifts in species distributions have already been documented for plants and animals in Canada.  In\n\nmany locations, di˛erential range shifts among species are likely to result in novel ecosystems that have di˛erent\n\nspecies assemblages, structural attributes, and ecological functions than existing ones.\nFor some species, the current and projected rates of environmental change exceed their natural ability to adapt,\n\nincreasing stress and threatening biodiversity.  As a result, climate change is magnifying the importance of managing\n\necosystems in a manner that enhances resilience and preserves biodiversity.\nProtected areas, including parks, wildlife reserves and marine protected areas will play an important role in the\n\nconservation of biodiversity by providing ﬁrefugeﬂ or migration corridors for native species, helping to maintain\ngenetic diversity.\nMany Canadian jurisdictions are expanding their parks and protected area systems as part of their overall management\n\nplans and climate change adaptation strategies. Associated research, monitoring, citizen science, public awareness,\n\nand visitor experience programs build understanding, engage the public and help them contribute to meaningful\n\nparticipatory decision-making.\nEcological restoration can strengthen resilience to climate change. Integration of climate change adaptation strategies\n\ninto restoration decision-making in Canada, as elsewhere, is complex.\nHuman Health (Chapter 7)\nStronger evidence has emerged since 2008 of the wide range of health risks to Canadians posed by a changing\n\nclimate.  For example, climate-sensitive diseases (e.g. Lyme disease) and vectors are moving northward into Canada\n\nand will likely continue to expand their range. In addition, new research suggests climate change will exacerbate\n\nair pollution issues in some parts of Canada, although further reductions in air contaminant emissions could o˛set\n\nclimate-related changes to ground-level ozone and particulate matter concentrations.\nA range of climate-related natural hazards continues to impact communities, presenting increasing risks to future\n\nhealth. Recent ˚ood and wild˜re events have severely impacted communities through destruction of infrastructure\n\nand displacement of populations.\nMany adaptation activities are being taken from local to national levels to help Canadians prepare for the health\n\nimpacts of climate change. Adaptation planning considers the underlying causes of health vulnerability, which di˛er\n\nacross urban, rural, coastal and northern communities.\nBox 1 continued on next page\n', 'Synthesis\n     5Provincial, territorial and local health authorities are gaining an increasing knowledge of climate change and health\nvulnerabilities through assessments and targeted research, and some jurisdictions have begun mainstreaming climate\n\nchange considerations into existing health policies and programs. E˛orts to increase public awareness about how to\n\nreduce climate-related health risks are also evident.\nAdaptation tools and measures, such as heat alert and response systems, projections of vector-borne disease expansion\n\nand greening urban environments can help protect Canadians from the e˛ects of climate change being felt now, and\n\nthose from future impacts.\nWater and Transportation Infrastructure (Chapter 8)\nWell-maintained infrastructure is more resilient to a changing climate. This is especially true with respect to gradual\nchanges in temperature and precipitation patterns. Key vulnerabilities are associated with the impacts of extreme\n\nweather events, which can overwhelm the capacity of water infrastructure.\nOver the past ˜ve years, the work of the PIEVC (Public Infrastructure Engineering Vulnerability Committee) has been\nan importan\nt driver of progress on understanding how to adapt Canada™s infrastructure to climate change. The broadly\napplicable, risk-based assessment protocol developed by the PIEVC allows engineers and planners to view and address\nclimate change as one factor among many a˛ecting system resiliency, and plan accordingly.\nConsideration of climate change as an element of adaptive asset management encourages consideration of climate\n\nfactors as part of ongoing system monitoring, and informs decisions regarding the most cost-e˛ective approaches\nfor infr\nastructure design, operation and maintenance.\nCodes, standards and related instruments (CSRI) are recognized as a potentially important driver of infrastructure\n\nadaptation, but there are few examples of CSRIs in Canada that considered historic changes or projected future\n\nchanges in climate when they were developed.  Further assessment of current and future climate-related risks to\n\ninfrastructure systems would help to inform appropriate adjustments to design codes and standards for addressing\n\nfuture climate.\nAdaptation: Linking Research and Practice (Chapter 9)\nAdaptation is being undertaken in Canada to achieve a range of goals, such as increasing capacity to adapt, improving\n\nresilience to speci˜c climate events (especially extremes), and enhancing ability to deal with di˛erent climate\n\nconditions. Among sectors, those with a demonstrated high sensitivity and exposure to climate and weather are\n\ngenerally most active in taking steps to understand, assess and manage vulnerability and risk related to climate change.\nAdaptation is not solely a local issue, although examples from the municipal level still appear to dominate. There are\n\nexamples of action by all levels of government, as well as community groups and industry, many of which represent\n\ncollaborative initiatives.\nUnderstanding of the barriers and challenges to adaptation has improved, with recognition that factors beyond the\n\nbasic determinants of adaptive capacity need to be addressed. As a result, understanding of how to overcome key\n\nbarriers and enable adaptation has improved.\nAdaptation implementation in Canada is still in its early stages. Planning and policy exercises, and e˛orts to build\n\ncapacity and raise awareness comprise much of the adaptation action documented, with relatively few documented\n\nexamples of implementation of speci˜c changes to reduce vulnerability to future climate change, or take advantage\nof poten\ntial opportunities.\nSeveral factors can help accelerate the transition between awareness and action, including leadership, targeted\n\nawareness-raising and supportive strategies or policies. Experiencing extreme weather events, as well as observing\n\nimpacts of gradual changes (e.g. sea level rise) also stimulates adaptation.\n', '6       Canada in a Changing Climate: Sector Perspectives on Impacts and Adaptation\nCANADA™S CLIMATE IS CHANGING, WITH OBSERVED CHANGES IN AIR \nTEMPERATURE, PRECIPITATION, SNOW AND ICE COVER AND OTHER INDICATORS. \n\nFURTHER CHANGES IN CLIMATE ARE INEVITABLE ˜\nCHAPTER 2˚. \nOver the last six decades, Canada has become warmer, with average temperatures over land increasing by 1.5°C \nbetween 1950 and 2010 (Figure 1).

Trends in annual precipitation have been less \n\nuniform across the Canadian landmass than those of annual air temperature. While signi˚cant changes in extreme precipitation \n\nhave been observed in some areas of the country, no consistent pattern is evident for the country as a whole.\nThere have also been observed trends in other climate indicators in Canada (\nsee Table 1). The Arctic has seen rapid declines in sea \nice extent, both in summer and winter (Figure 3). In addition, snowfall has decreased across southern Canada, while snow cover \n\nis melting earlier in spring, and glaciers in western Canada and the Arctic are shrinking.\nAt the global scale, sea level over the past century has risen in \nresponse to warmer ocean temperatures (thermal expansion) \n\nand to the melting of glaciers, ice caps and ice sheets. Regional \n\npatterns of sea level rise along Canadian coastlines are strongly \n\nin˛uenced by vertical land motion, with sea level rising rapidly \n\nat some sites where the land is subsiding, and falling in others \n\nwhere the land is rising (\nsee Table 1\n). Further changes in climate are inevitable. On average, warmer \n\ntemperatures and more rainfall are expected for the country as a \n\nwhole, with increases in extreme heat and heavy rainfall events, \n\nand declines in snow and ice cover.

Shifts in the range of some species of birds, butter˛ies and trees in \nresponse to warming temperatures have been documented, as have changes in the timing of life-history events (such as earlier \n\nmigration to breeding areas and earlier ˛owering of plants). Maple trees, for example, have experienced a signi˚cant northward \n\nshift since 1971 (\nsee Case Study 1, \nCh. 4).  Northward shifts have also been observed in ecosystems of the Bering Sea, with \n\nexamples of southern assemblages displacing norther\nn aquatic populations (Ch. 4).  \nDeclines in bir\nd populations have also been documented, with 20 common North American bird species losing over 50% of \ntheir populations over the last 40 years \n(Ch. 7). \nIncreased forest disturbance associated with insects, drought and forest ˚res \n have increased tree mortality in BC and the Prairies. Mortality rates have also risen in sockeye salmon, in response to higher \n \nwater temperatures in the Fraser River \n(Ch. 7), \nwhile salmon production rates have declined \n(Ch. 4). \nIn addition to impacts on the natural environment, changing climate is a˜ecting many of Canada™s economic sectors as well \n\nas human health. This includes impacts on sectors with obvious climate sensitivities such as forestry, agriculture, ˚sheries, \n\nhydroelectricity, transportation, tourism and insurance. A prime example is the mountain pine beetle outbreak in western \n\nCanada. Warmer winter temperatures in the region are one factor that has allowed beetle populations to expand \n \nto unprecedented sizes, leading to the largest and most severe outbreak on record (\nsee Case Study 1, \nCh. 3). As of 2012, about \n18.1 million hectares of f\norest were a˜ected (Figure 4; \nCh. 3). Health impacts include lengthening of the ragweed season \n(between 1995 and 2009, the season incr\neased by more than 25 days in Saskatoon and Winnipeg \n(Ch. 7)) \nand spreading of  Lyme disease vectors (ticks), which has resulted in the annual number of Canadian cases increasing from 30 to more than \n \n250 in recent years \n(Ch. 7). \nNorthern Canada has experienced particularly rapid rates of warming over recent years (\nsee Figure 1). Climate change impacts \non livelihoods, culture, mental health and well-being have been reported by northern residents \n(Ch. 7). \nSafety concerns \nassociated with less predictable ice conditions and marine storms are an issue, for example, as are the e˜ects of reduced \n sea ice on traditional hunting activities \n(Ch. 4) \nand the impacts of permafrost thaw on infrastructure \n(Ch. 8). \nWinter r\noads in northern Canada ha\nve experienced reduced ice thickness and shortened operating seasons, which decreases their reliability \n and constrains the load volumes that can be safely transported. For example, the shortened road season in 2006 forced the \nFIGURE 4: \n Map of Mountain Pine Beetle distribution, showing change for the 2002Œ2006 and 2007Œ2011 time \nperiods and direction of change (\nSource: Natural Resources Canada, 2012c\n).', 'Synthesis\n     11Diavik Diamond Mine to spend an extra $11.25 million to ˛y in fuel (Ch. 3).

Extreme events, including storms (wind, ice and snow), ˛ooding \n\nand heat waves have had signi˚cant economic (Figure 5) and health and safety impacts on Canadians. In 2011, the Canadian \n\ninsurance industry paid out a record $1.7 billion for property damage associated with weather events, such as ˛ooding, wind and \n\nwild˚res. This record will be broken in 2013, as the insured losses from ˛ooding damage in Southern Alberta (June) and Toronto \n\n(July) are ˚nalized (IBC, 2013a; IBC, 2013b).  While factors other than climate also contributed to the rising payout trend (e.g. \n\nincreased exposure of property, increasing wealth and aging infrastructure), these losses, along with the many possible health \n\nimpacts (\nCh. 7) demonstrate that Canadians are vulnerable to extreme weather events. \nThere is growing con˚dence that some types of extreme events will increase in frequency and/or intensity due to climate \n\nchange (Ch. 2). For example, at the global scale, warm days and nights are \nvirtually certain\n4 to increase in frequency and \nmagnitude and heat waves are \nvery likely\n4 to increase in duration, frequency and/or intensity.\n Heavy precipitation events and \nextreme sea levels are also projected to occur more frequently. In Canada, studies have suggested that droughts, especially in the \n\nsouthern Prairies, heavy precipitation events, with associated increased risk of ˛ooding (\nCh. 2), forest ˚res (\nCh. 3), stor\nms (Ch. 5) and hot days and warm nights (Figure 6; \nCh. 7) would increase in frequency and/or intensity in a warmer climate.\n4   The IPCC denotes likelihood with the following scale: Virtually certain- 99-100% probability; Very likely- 90-100% probability;  Likely- 66-100% probability; About as likely as not- \n\n33 to 66% probability; Unlik\nely- 0-33% probability; Very unlikely- 0-10% probability; Exceptionally unlikely- 0-1% probability.\nFIGURE 5: \n Examples of insured losses from extreme weather events in Canada (\nSources: IBC, 2008, 2011b, 2013a, b; McBean, 2012\n).', '12       Canada in a Changing Climate: Sector Perspectives on Impacts and Adaptation\nExtreme events were identi˚ed as key issues for all sectors \ndiscussed in this report. For example, events relating to \n\nwater availability Œ both excesses and shortages Œ represent \n\nconcerns for most economic sectors, as well as for \n\nbiodiversity and human health. Flooding can overwhelm \n\ninfrastructure, causing not only signi˚cant local impacts, but \n\nalso leading to broader impacts by damaging transportation \n\nnetworks and compromising access and supply chains (\nCh. \n8). Drought is also associated with many immediate and \n\nlong-term economic and social impac\nts (Ch. 4). \nAs an industr\ny, farming relies upon the inter-annual \npredictability of seasonal weather as it facilitates \n\ncrop selection and infrastructure investments (\nCh. 4). \nUnpredictable conditions can cause unanticipated farm \n\nlosses. For example, an unprecedented heat wave in Ontario \n\nin March 2012 caused fruit trees to blossom 5 weeks \n\nearlier than usual, and subsequent frosts in April destroyed \n\napproximately 80% of apple blossoms (Environment \n\nCanada, 2013). Total losses for tender fruits that year were \n\nestimated at $100 million (Environment Canada, 2013).\nFIGURE 6: \n Historical and projected number of hot days and warm \nnights for selected cities in Canada (\nSource: Casati and \nYagouti, 2010\n).ADAPTATION IS ACCEPTED AS A NECESSARY RESPONSE TO CLIMATE CHANGE. IT \nENHANCES THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC RESILIENCE OF CANADIANS TO CLIMATE CHANGE \n\nIMPACTS ˜\nCHAPTERS 3 \nTO \n9˚. \nAcross Canada, there is evidence of increasing awareness and acceptance of the need to adapt to climate change (\nCh. \n9). Broadened engagement in adaptation is re˛ected across sectors, at all levels of government, in certain industries and \ncompanies, as well as in the academic literature (Figure 7) and the media. Discussions now tend to focus on determining where \n\nadaptive action is required and improving understanding of the process of adaptation Œ i.e. how adaptation can be addressed \n\nand where capacity to adapt needs to be enhanced.\nThis is especially evident for those sectors with greater \n\nexposure to weather and weather variability. Direct \n\nexperience with changing conditions, such as shorter snow \n\nseasons for winter tourism (\nCh. 5), shifting ˛ow patterns \nfor hy\ndroelectricity generation (\nCh. 3) and increasing \nhealth impacts from heat (\nCh. 7), as well as extreme \nweather events (\ne.g. ˛oods, droughts and wild˚res) raises \nawareness of climate change and the severity of potential \n\nimpacts. In the forest sector, for example, severe wild˚res \n\nand pest outbreaks in British Columbia and Alberta have \n\ncontributed to increased awareness of climate change \n\nadaptation, spurring industry and governments to begin \n\nto move towards adaptive management approaches \n\nthat proactively address risks and opportunities, rather \n\nthan depending on crisis management strategies (\nCh. 3). Following the 2013 spring ˛ood in Alberta, the provincial \n\ngovernment introduced policies to help reduce losses \n\nfrom future ˛ooding events, including new restrictions on \n\nredevelopment in ˛oodways and ˛ood fringes (Alberta \n\nGovernment, 2013).  \nFIGURE 7: \n Number of climate change adaptation articles by \nCanadian resear\nchers by sector (2000Œ2012).\n', 'Synthesis\n     13Policies, regulations and guidelines are mechanisms that governments can use to raise awareness and encourage or \nrequire adaptive action. The City of Vancouver, for example, reviewed its ˛ood-proo˚ng policies and now encourages \n\napplicants with projects in identi˚ed ˛ood hazard areas to plan for 1 metre of sea level rise (Ch. 8). For the private sector, \n\nfactors that enhance awareness include reporting requirements for material risk, and the drive to stay competitive and \n\nmeet trade demands. Financial disclosure of climate change risks shows promise as a tool to promote climate change \nadaptation within industry (\nCh. 3, 5).ADAPTATION IS OCCURRING WITH INCREASING FREQUENCY AND ENHANCED \nENGAGEMENT.  CONTINUED ACTION WILL HELP TO BUILD CAPACITY, ADDRESS \n\nINFORMATION NEEDS AND OVERCOME CHALLENGES ˜\nCHAPTERS 3 \nTO \n9˚.  \nSince publication of the 2008 assessment there has been a signi˚cant increase in the number of adaptation activities in \nCanada, primarily with respect to planning (including strategies, frameworks, and guidance documents) and initiatives \n\naimed at enhancing adaptive capacity (\nTable 3\n).  From the breadth and scope of these examples, it is evident that there \nare many di˜erent approaches to adaptation. However, adaptation actions have been mostly incremental in nature, \n\nbuilding on existing initiatives, assuming a continuation of current climate trends, and focused on no-regrets actions \n\nthat are bene˚cial regardless of future climate. In many cases, action on adaptation was spurred by observed impacts \n\nor experience with extreme weather events.\nAdaptation Activities\nSector\nProvincial governments in BC, Alberta and Quebec are modifying seed transfer guidelines for \nreforestation to take shifting climate envelopes into account\nForestry \n(Ch. 3)\nA hydroelectric corporation is integrating climate change considerations in demand forecasts, \n\ninforming rate adjustments and procurement plans\nEnergy \n(Ch. 3)\nThe mining industry is applying techniques to protect northern infrastructure from permafrost \n\nwarming (e.g. deeper pile foundations, adjustable foundations)\nMining \n(Ch. 3)\nThe federal government is revising taxation schemes to help producers manage weather-related risk \n\n(e.g. allowing income to be deferred)\nAgriculture \n(Ch. 4)\nIndustry associations in BC are developing a tourism action plan to respond to mountain pine \n \nbeetle damageTourism \n(Ch. 5)\nInsurers are adjusting property insurance coverage (e.g. no longer o˛ering sewer back up insurance in \n\ncommunities with recurring losses)\nInsurance \n(Ch. 5)\nSubsidy programs have been adopted by a number of municipalities to encourage the installation \n\nof backwater valves that can help to reduce ˚ood damage from an increase in the frequency and \n\nintensity of rainfall events\nResidential Housing \n(Ch. 5)\nThe Manitoba government is protecting winter habitat for the Qamanirjuaq barren-ground caribou \n\nherd in the transition zone between boreal and tundra ecosystems\nBiodiversity and Protected \nAreas \n(Ch. 6)\nThe federal government is developing tools to guide public health managers on vector-borne disease \n\nsurveillance and control methods\nHealth (Ch. 7)\nCommunities across the country are developing heat alert and response systems to protect health \n\nfrom extreme heat events\nHealth (Ch. 7)\nA risk assessment of three coastal roads in Nova Scotia led to recommendations that include \n\nengineered shoreline protection and relocation of selected roads further inland\nInfrastructure \n(Ch. 8)\nCambridge and Milton, ON are performing economic assessments of the implications of climate \n\nchange for drainage infrastructure design\nInfrastructure \n(Ch. 8)\nTABLE 3: \n  \nExamples of adaptation activities from di˛erent sectors.\n', '14       Canada in a Changing Climate: Sector Perspectives on Impacts and Adaptation\nProgress on adaptation is evident, and the examples presented in this report are indicative of the type of actions that will \nbecome increasingly necessary as the climate continues to change.  However, more work is needed. All chapters in this \n\nreport identify information needs and knowledge and data gaps, and many discuss barriers and challenges to adaptation, \nincluding limited resources, limited motivation and issues related to governance (\nCh. 9). In addition, by analyzing the \nexamples available, it is apparent that there are relatively few examples of concrete, on-the-ground adaptation measures \nbeing implemented speci˚cally to reduce vulnerability to projected changes in climate. This indicates that, similar to other \n\ndeveloped countries, adaptation in Canada is still in its early stages overall.  It is also recognized that the methodology of \n\nthis assessment, with its focus on scienti˚c literature, may result in an underestimation of the actual number of adaptation \n\nactions being undertaken in Canada. \nPlanned adaptation takes time.  Adaptation often requires research, stakeholder engagement and adjustments to policies \nand regulations. For example, while a year-round road has been proposed to ensure access to northern mining sites \nto help address the declining reliability of ice-road networks \n(Ch. 8), \nthis type of project cannot be undertaken without \ndetailed planning, consultations and environmental impact studies. In the ˚sheries sector, ˚shers cannot simply adjust \ntheir harvests in response to shifting species assemblages Œ this requires governments to revise management plans and \n˚shing permits (\nCh. 4). There will also be cases where maintaining current activities is not feasible and/or cost-e˜ective, requiring discussions \n\nto extend beyond consideration of incremental, no-regrets approaches to more transformative changes. The emerging \n\nconcept of transformational change refers to larger-scale, more extensive adaptations that are new to a region or resource \nsystem \n(Ch. 9).  \nTransformational change may also challenge the status quo and thereby question perceptions of what is \nacceptable. Examples include relocating entire towns due to sea level rise; converting forest plots to parkland to reduce \nlosses from forest ˚res; and designing ˛ood-control infrastructure to fail safely (with minimal damage and losses), rather \n\nthan withstand large-magnitude events. The need for transformational adaptation is likely to become more prevalent as \n\nthe climate continues to change.\nADAPTATION CAN SOMETIMES TURN RISKS INTO OPPORTUNITIES, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nINTO BENEFITS ˜\nCHAPTERS 3 \nTO \n9˚.  \nWhile adaptation research and programming tend to focus on reducing vulnerability to negative impacts, some impacts of \nclimate change could represent opportunities. Capturing these opportunities requires appropriate adaptation. \nThis may be most evident in the tourism and agriculture sectors, which both stand to potentially bene˚t from longer \nsummers. With e˜ective adaptation (e.g. strategies to deal with potential water shortages), major warm-weather tourism \n\nmarkets in Canada could bene˚t from climate change, with the golf industry, for example, pro˚ting from increased season \nlength and demand (Ch. 5). Similarly, with higher summer temperatures, di˜erent types of crops may be able to be grown \nfarther north (e.g. corn and soybeans in new areas in Quebec, canola in Prince George, BC, and spring seeded small grains \nin western Alberta and northeastern BC; \nCh. 4). Producers would need to adapt their crop selections and timing (e.g. \nseeding earlier in order to decrease exposure to drier late summer conditions) to take advantage of these opportunities. In \nall cases, risks related to increased pests, heat waves and other extreme events will also need to be addressed. In the North, \n\nchanging climate and ice conditions bring potential economic opportunities related to natural resource development and \ntourism (\nCh. 3, 5, 6). However, in addition to presenting opportunities for employment and investment, such activities also \nbring environmental and cultural risks.  \nInnovative ideas and approaches may help reduce losses associated with climate change, at least on a short-term basis. \n\nFor example, faced with a surplus of blue stained wood from the Mountain Pine Beetle outbreak, the forest industry in BC \n\nbegan marketing the product for interior paneling and unique wood furniture, after completing studies to con˚rm the \nwood would perform to acceptable standards \n(Ch. 3). \nAlso in BC, the city of Vancouver used the damage caused by the \n2006 windstorm in Stanley Park as an opportunity to increase public engagement in the park and replant a more wind-\nresilient forest \n(Ch. 3).  \nSome tourism operators and recreation sites are considering promoting ﬁlast chance tourismﬂ, where \nadditional tourists are drawn to a park to see either changing landscapes or certain features (e.g. glaciers or certain wildlife \nspecies) before they decline or disappear (\nCh. 5, 7).', 'Synthesis\n     15COLLABORATION AND ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT ARE APPROACHES THAT GOVERNMENTS \nAND INDUSTRY ARE INCREASINGLY PURSUING TO ADVANCE ADAPTATION ˜\nCHAPTER 9˚. \nCollaboration has emerged as an important mechanism for successful and e˝cient adaptation to climate change. Across \nsectors, there is a common challenge of needing to adapt to continuous cumulative changes with limited resources. By \n\nlearning from the work of others (e.g. through assessments, communities of practice and workshops) and collaborating \n\nwith organizations that share similar goals, e˝ciencies and synergies can be found.  Numerous examples of collaborations \n\nbetween di˜erent levels of government, as well as industry and non-governmental groups are discussed throughout this \n\nreport (\nBox 2\n) and continued collaboration will be a key driver moving adaptation forward. While roles and mandates may \n\ndi˜er between jurisdictions and organizations, the end goals of reducing vulnerability to climate change and enhancing \n\nresilience are shared.\nMany sectors are starting to use adaptive management approaches (Figure 8) to deal with changes in climate and other \nstressors and related uncertainties (which will always be present in adaptation decision-making). Adaptive management \n\ninvolves ongoing monitoring, adjusting, experimenting and re-evaluating, and requires a ˛exible and responsive approach to \n\nadaptation. Examples of adaptive management approaches discussed in this report include operations related to hydroelectric \n\ngeneration (Ch. 3), water level management on the Great Lakes (\nCh. 8, 9), and forest stand management (\nCh. 3). \nFIGURE 8: \n Adaptive management assessment process (\nmodi˜ed from Leger and Read, 2012, Figure 2-1, p. 8\n).', '16       Canada in a Changing Climate: Sector Perspectives on Impacts and Adaptation\nBOX 2\nEXAMPLES OF CASE STUDIES HIGHLIGHTING COLLABORATION \nCollaboration to enhance adaptation decision-making (\nChapter 9, \nCase Study 1):\n Canada™s federal, provincial and \nterritorial \ngovernments have invested in collaborative programming as a cornerstone for advancing knowledge and action \non adaptation, through past activities (e.g. the Canadian Climate Impacts and Adaptation Research Network [C-CIARN]) and \nongoing initiatives.

As \na result, the need to adapt is increasingly recognized and acted upon by governments, industry and other organizations. \n\nOver the past 5 years, our understanding of the adaptation process has improved and examples of adaptation \n\nimplementation have grown. We have seen broadened engagement on the issue, and changes being made to policies, \n\nplans and practices to increase resilience to climate change. Further adaptation is necessary to complement mitigation in \n\nhelping to prevent and reduce future impacts, as well as to take advantage of potential opportunities. We now have the \n\nawareness and capacity to adapt in many cases; translating this to action will require continued collaborative e˜orts to \n\nreduce barriers, overcome challenges and enhance motivation to adapt. \n', '18       Canada in a Changing Climate: Sector Perspectives on Impacts and Adaptation\nREFERENCESAlberta Government (2013):  Flood Choices for Albertans, online,  <\nhttps://pabappsuat.\nalberta.ca/albertacode/images/Flood-Choices-for-Albertans.pdf\n>.Casati, B. and Yagouti, A.
