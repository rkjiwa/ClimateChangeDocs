(201). Introduction. In K. Palko and  D.S. Lemmen (Eds.), Climate risks and adaptation practices for the Canadian transportation sector 201 (pp. 2-10).  Ottawa, ON: Government of Canada.\n1 Geography and Environmental Management, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON\n2Transport Canada, Ottawa, ON\n', ' 3CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTIONS 3The Earth™s climate is changing, and Canada is warming at a faster rate than most regions in the \nworld. From 1950 to 2010, the average annual temperature in Canada has increased by close to \n1.5°C, which is approximately double the global average (Bush et al., 2014). This warming trend has \n\nbeen associated with changes to other important climatic variables, including precipitation, sea level, \n\ninland water levels, sea ice, permafrost, and extreme weather events (Table 1). \nIn the coming decades, anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases will result in further changes to \nglobal and regional climates. These changes have implications for the transportation sector, and the \n\nCanadian economy and society more broadly.  \nThe Government of Canada has produced a series of climate change assessments at the national \nlevel, which identify observed and expected impacts to Canada™s economy, society, and \n\nenvironment; and practices to adapt to these impacts. These include: \n Canada™s Marine Coasts in a Changing \n\nClimate (2016); Canada in a Changing Climate: Sector \n Perspectives on Impacts and Adaptation \n\n(2014); \n From Impacts to Adaptation: Canada in \n a Changing Climate (2007); Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation: \n\nA Canadian Perspective (2004); and, Canada Country Study: Climate Impacts \n\nand Adaptation (1997-98).While these reports indicate that some aspects of transportation are highly vulnerable to changing \n\nclimatic conditions, adapting infrastructure and operations to a changing climate and emerging \n\nenvironmental conditions remains a relatively new area of focus for the transportation sector.\nPURPOSE AND FORMAT OF REPORT\nThis report is a snap-shot in time, presenting the state of knowledge about climate risks to the \n\nCanadian transportation sector, and identifying existing or potential adaptation practices that may \n\nbe applied to reduce them. It is intended to serve as an accessible source of information that can \n\ninform decision-making and policy development, without making recommendations or prescribing \n\n\n\ndecision-makers and practitioners with information intended to support enhanced resilience to \n\nclimate risks, while also serving as a knowledge foundation for future research.\n\nvulnerabilities, priorities, practices and opportunities across Canada™s national transportation system. \n\n\n\nnetworks, in addition to examining observed climate impacts, future risks, opportunities, and \n\nadaptation approaches for road, rail, air, and marine transportation. \nClimate risks considered within the framework of this report include both changing climate conditions \n(ﬁslow onsetﬂ changes, such as permafrost thaw and sea level changes) and extreme weather \n', ' 4CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTIONS 4\nweather event to climate change, there is \n\n\n\nevents will increase in frequency and/or intensity \n\nas the climate continues to warm, and these \n\n\n\ninfrastructure and operations.\nThe development of this report represents \n\n\nbringing together the knowledge, expertise \n\nand perspectives of the chapter authors and \n\nreviewers. Based on available literature, each \n\nchapter includes an assessment of peer-reviewed \n\n(academic) and grey literature relevant to the \n\ntransportation-climate nexus in the given region. \n\nFurthermore, to round out the knowledge base \n\nin cases where existing literature was limited, \n\nseveral chapters also integrate perspectives from \n\ntransportation practitioners, and are cited as \n\npersonal communications.Collectively, these features have shaped the unique content found in the chapters. For example, the \nUrban Chapter emphasizes transportation planning approaches; the British Columbia and Northern \n\nchapters provide greater detail on engineering practices and extreme precipitation risks; and the \n\nPrairies Chapter incorporates content on practitioner experiences and adaptations within the trucking \n\nindustry. The Synthesis chapter attempts to bring these regional and urban perspectives together to \n\ncapture the state of knowledge at the national level on climate risks and adaptation practices for \n\nCanada™s transportation system.Content that has been deemed out of scope for \nthe purposes of this report includes:\n Impacts on pipelines and power transmission \n\ninfrastructure;\n Indirect impacts on transportation \n\nassociated with climate change impacts \non other sectors (e.g., agriculture, tourism \n\nInterdependencies among municipal \n\nsectors are considered in Chapter 9;\n Disaster and emergency management \n\npractices; and The impact of transportation on the climate \n(e.g., greenhouse gas emissions) and \nclimate change mitigation activities.CANADA™S TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM \nCanadians depend on transportation services for day-to-day travel, and for the movement \nof resources and goods vital to the economy. Canada™s communities and markets are widely \n\ndispersed, spanning a distance of more than 5,000 km from east to west and 4,500 km from north to \n\nsouth. Industries such as manufacturing, energy, mining and agriculture, as well as services such as \n\nhealthcare and retail trade, all depend on the reliable functioning of the transportation system.  \n\nlocal, national, and international movements (Figure 1 and Figure 2).

These \nsensitivities can translate into infrastructure damage \n\nand deterioration, disruptions to transport operations, \nand unsafe conditions. Some of the most vulnerable \ncomponents of Canada™s transport system are integral \n\nto remote and resource-based communities in the \n\nNorth. However, a changing climate and extreme \n\nweather will affect all modes of transportation in every \n\nCanadian region.  \nTransportation™s sensitivities to climate and extreme \nweather are illustrated by the impacts of acute \n\nweather events in recent years. For example, \n\n\n\nin Alberta Œ resulted in an estimated $6 billion in \n\ndamages and recovery costs, and saw 1,000 km \n\nof roads destroyed and hundreds of bridges and \n\n\n\nin the Greater Toronto Area, which is considered to \n\nbe the most expensive natural disaster in Ontario, \n\n\n\ncancellations (Environment Canada, 2014). \nEXTREME WEATHER TRENDS\nTrends in extreme precipitation events \n\n\nclimate data, due to spatial variability in precipitation patterns. However, insurance \ndata demonstrates that natural disasters \nhave been increasing in Canada, including \n\n\nReduction, 2012). While many factors, other than climate change, contribute to rising insurance losses (including exposure of \nproperty, increasing wealth, and aging \n\ninfrastructure), this trend demonstrates \n\na pattern of infrastructure vulnerability \n\nin Canada to extreme weather events \n(Warren and Lemmen, 2014).   \nExtreme weather events are not the only climate risk to transportation. Other risks to the Canadian \ntransportation system, associated with a changing climate, include the following: \n \n\nchallenges, especially in permafrost regions of northern Canada, but also across southern Canada \n\ndue to changing freeze-thaw cycles during the winter and heat waves during the summer.\n Changing ice conditions affect marine operations and vessel navigation, especially in northern \n\nCanada, with broad implications (both positive and negative) for economic development, trade, \n\nand security.  \n \n\ndamage, with implications for transportation infrastructure and operations in coastal areas of Canada.  \n Low inland water levels (particularly in the Great Lakes) can reduce vessel capacity, and create \n\nADAPTATION OPTIONS\nAdaptation options for transportation may include engineering and technological solutions, as well as \n\npolicy, planning, management, and maintenance approaches. Some examples, from the chapters in \n\nthis report, include:\n Changing pavement mixes for roads, for example using more heat-tolerant pavements; \n Expanding drainage capacity for infrastructure, including culvert size;\n \n\nclearing snow to preserve permafrost stability under vulnerable roads;\n', ' 10CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTIONS 10 Implementing heaters and cooling fans to improve \n\n\ntemperatures, and thermosyphons to maintain \n\npermafrost stability at airports;\n Changing infrastructure design requirements to include \n\n\n\nevent thresholds; \n Elevating or relocating new infrastructure where feasible; \n Changing engineering procedures, such as increasing \n\ntemperature thresholds for rail track to reduce risk of \n\nbuckling during large temperature differentials;\n Increasing monitoring of weather events and \n\ninfrastructure conditions;  \n Implementing or enhancing travel advisories and alerts \n\nto communicate travel conditions and service delays \n\nduring weather events.There are two categories of response \nto climate change Œ mitigation and \n\nadaptation. \nMitigation refers to human \ninterventions to reduce greenhouse \n\ngas emissions.  \nAdaptation refers to any activity \nthat reduces the negative impacts \n\nof climate change and/or takes \n\nadvantage of new opportunities. \n\nThis includes actions taken before \nimpacts are observed (anticipatory), \nand after impacts have been felt \n\n(reactive). Adaptation can be \n\nplanned (i.e., the result of deliberate \npolicy decisions), or spontaneous, \nin the case of reactive adaptation \n(Warren and Lemmen, 2014). \nREFERENCESAtkinson, D.E., Forbes, D.L., and James, T.S.

Studies are underway to better understand \nthese vulnerabilities, and adaptive practices are being undertaken to reduce future impacts. \n\nRegional chapters provide further details on initiatives related to the\n Great Lakes-St. Lawrence \nSeaway, the Chignecto Isthmus (highway and rail), Port Metro Vancouver, Port Saint John, and \n\nother trade infrastructure. \n Climate and weather-related delays and disruptions to passenger travel could become more \n\nfrequent in future. \nThese events can temporarily isolate remote communities in northern regions, \nwhich may rely on a single highway or airport for connectivity, and lead to costly damages \n\nand travel disruptions for large urban areas. Redundancies in transportation systems (allowing \n\nmultiple methods of travel) are one method to reduce these impacts. \n Northern transportation systems are experiencing some of the greatest impacts from warming, \nand temperatures will continue to increase at a faster rate than any other region in Canada.\n  Degrading (thawing) permafrost has caused damage to roads, railways, and airport taxiways \n\n\n\nbudgets in the North. The operating windows and capacities of some winter (ice) roads have also \n\nshortened in recent years, resulting in the need for alternative methods of shipping.  \n A changing climate is expected to result in some opportunities for Canadian transportation. \n\n\n\n\n for all modes.  Melting sea ice is also slowly opening up arctic waters to new navigation routes\n, however, \nthe increased mobility of summer sea ice, as well as increased coastal erosion and storm \n\n\n\ninfrastructure.\n Reactive approach\nes to managing climate risks (e.g., responding to past impacts or events), \nremain common in Canada™s transportation sector.\n At the same time, examples can be found \nin all regions, and for all transportation modes, of actions being taken in anticipation of future \n\nclimate conditions. Many owners and operators, both public and private, have adapted \ntheir operations based on investigations and lessons learned from past weather-related \nevents. Transportation decision-makers are also more frequently engaging in pro-active planning.\n Transportation decision-makers are increasingly adopting a risk management approach to \nreduce climate risks to their infrastructure and operations.\n \nbeing used to enhance climate resilience of transportation systems, including integration \n\nof climate considerations into organizational planning, policy and design changes, risk \n\nand vulnerability assessments, structural and physical adaptations, smart technologies and \n\noperational and maintenance changes.

Provinces and \n\n\n\nchanges, and coastal erosion. Canada™s northern regions, including the three territories and the \n\nnorthern parts of several provinces, all face risks associated with thawing permafrost. \nExamples of past impacts to each region™s transportation system from climate change and extreme \nevents are depicted in Figure 1. These impacts are characteristic of many, though not all, of the future \n\nrisks these regions face. \nFigure 1.

While operating windows have \nalways been variable from year to year, recent increases in surface temperature have shortened \nthe operating season for some winter roads. This has resulted in the need for alternative, and often \n\nmore costly, methods of shipping, such as air transportation.  \n The climatic changes that are opening up northern marine waters to exploration and shipping are \n\n\nIncreasing temperatures have led to a rapid decrease \nin sea ice extent, and reduced volumes of multi-year sea ice.\n  While these changes are slowly \nopening up waterways to new navigational routes, the increased mobility of summer sea ice, \n\n\n\nshipping, exploration, and associated coastal infrastructure. \n While many adaptation techniques can be used to maintain roads, rail, and airport taxiways \n\nand runways on permafrost rich soil, some can be cost-prohibitive. \nSeveral practices rely on \nthe availability of specialized equipment and materials, which can be expensive to transport to \n\nnorthern locations.\n1.0 INTRODUCTION\n\nplanet (Bush et al., 2014).  Changing temperatures, precipitation patterns and storm frequency are \n\naffecting northern ecosystems, livelihoods, and infrastructure, including transportation. In addition to \n\nwithstanding harsh weather conditions, much of Canada™s northern infrastructure was designed and \n\n\n\nchanging and will continue to change in coming years (National Round Table on the Environment \n\nand the Economy, 2009). In particular, the changing temperatures of the North are affecting the \n\nstructural integrity of buildings, roads (both all-weather and seasonal), airport runways, rail and marine \n\ninfrastructure, navigable waterways, and other infrastructure. In the most extreme circumstances, \n\nchanges have contributed to infrastructure failure (Government of Nunavut et al., 2011). Changing \n\ntemperatures are also affecting the length of winter road seasons, in some cases resulting in the need \n\nfor alternative, more costly, shipping methods to reach remote communities (Government of Nunavut \n\net al., 2011). Resulting disruptions to transportation operations can also affect community re-supply \n\nand food security. On the water, changing sea ice patterns have affected traditional food harvesting \n\npractices and marine shipping (Government of Nunavut et al., 2011).\n', ' 30CHAPTER 3: NORTHERN TERRITORIES\n 30Trends of warming temperatures and increasingly-severe storm events are projected to continue in \nthe future. Although northern governments and practitioners have begun planning and adapting \n\nto climate change, additional practices and resilience-building strategies are needed to ensure the \n\nreliability and longevity of transportation infrastructure and systems in northern Canada. \nThis chapter assesses the many challenges and opportunities for transportation, associated with \nclimate change in Canada™s three northern territories Œ the Yukon, the Northwest Territories, and \n\nNunavut. The chapter provides a regional overview of the territories™ distinct geography and \n\ntransportation networks; discusses observed and projected changes in the northern climate; provides \n\nexamples of associated impacts on transportation; describes adaptation practices to mitigate these \n\n\n\nfuture climate risks and opportunities. This synthesis of information aims to enhance understanding of \n\nclimate risks and adaptation practices within the transportation sector, and inform decision-making.\n1.1 REGIONAL OVERVIEW\nCanada™s North is characterized by its vast size; diverse and rugged landscape; harsh climate; frozen \n\nground (i.e. permafrost); and seasonally frozen waterways and marine waters. The landscape of the \n\nNorth includes long coastlines, Canada™s highest mountain range (the Saint Elias in the Yukon), densely \n\nforested areas (across much of the Yukon and large parts of the Northwest Territories) and tundra \n\n(across all of Nunavut, large parts of the Northwest Territories, and the extreme north of the Yukon).   \nWhile the capital cities of the three territories all have populations in excess of 7,000 people, the \nregion™s many other communities generally feature small populations situated vast distances \n\nfrom one another, with many only reachable by air or water (see Table 1). \nThese characteristics \npresent challenges for transportation infrastructure and operations Œ and for economic and social \n\ndevelopment more broadly Œ in the North.  \nTable 1: Territorial North Demographic Overview (2014 population estimates).\n (Source: Statistics \nCanada, 2012a, b, c and Statistics Canada 2014).IndicatorYukon\nNorthwest Territories\nNunavutTotal \nPopulation36,51043,62336,585116,718Area (km\n2)474,7131,143,7931,877,7883,496,294Population Density/km20.10.040.020.03Number of Communities19332577The economies of the territories are predominantly resource-based Œ mining and oil and gas production \n\nare the region™s primary economic drivers. Mining activity and oil production in the Yukon and \n\nNorthwest Territories are highly dependent upon road transport and systems for supplies and exports. This \n\nincludes a number of key winter roads that support resource-development projects, particularly in the \n\nNorthwest Territories (for example, the Tibbitt to Contwoyto Winter Road Œ see Case study 1). In contrast, \n\neconomic activities in Nunavut are especially reliant upon sea-based transportation, as there are no \n\nroads connecting communities and moving goods by air is costly. In the future, marine transportation is \n\nexpected to play an increased role in the economies of the territories. \nThe North also has a vibrant social economy, with a diverse mix of people and cultures. In 2011, 52 \nper cent of the population of the Northwest Territories, 86 per cent of Nunavut, and 17 per cent of \n\n\n\n\n\nroutes across snow and ice. Inuit, who have traditionally used sea ice as a ﬁhighwayﬂ to resources, \n', ' 31CHAPTER 3: NORTHERN TERRITORIES\n 31have been forced to adapt to thinning sea ice. This has required travelling farther distances to hunt \nand harvest animals that have changed their migratory patterns (Inuit Circumpolar Council, 2008).\n \n\nand other goods.2.0 AN INTRODUCTION TO CANADA™S NORTHERN TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM\nWhile territorial transportation networks are similar in some respects, each territory™s infrastructure \n\nhas unique characteristics. For instance, Nunavut has no all-weather roads connecting it to southern \n\nCanada, relying instead on air and marine transportation. The Yukon depends primarily on road \n\ntransportation, and has all-weather roads connecting all communities except for Old Crow. The \n\nNorthwest Territories, meanwhile, depends on marine, rail, air, and road transportation (Table 2).\nThe frozen landscape offers opportunities for transportation, providing a seasonal foundation for \nwinter roads. During the winter, sea, river, and lake ice can facilitate the movement of goods and \n\npeople throughout the territories. However, operating windows for winter roads are limited, with \n\nroads typically only in operation from November/December until March/April (Prowse et al., 2009). In \n\naddition, permafrost conditions affect the stability of all-season transportation infrastructure, including \n\nroads and airport runways.\nDuring the summer, navigable waters are used for shipping purposes, providing community resupply to \n\n\nlink between northern communities and southern Canada for essential medical and evacuation \n\nservices. \nIn light of the risks to northern transportation systems posed by a changing climate (discussed in detail \nin subsequent sections), the need for adaptation related to transportation has been acknowledged \n\nby both federal and territorial governments. The Government of the Northwest Territories \n\ncommissioned the development of a Climate Change Adaptation Plan for the Department of \n\nTransportation in 2013 (Deton™Cho-Stantec, 2013). Nunavut established the Nunavut Climate Change \n\nCentre, released a report on climate change impacts and adaptation, and collaborated with the \n\nCanadian Institute of Planners on an ﬁadaptation planning toolkitﬂ in 2011 (Government of Nunavut, \n\n2011; Bowron and Davidson, 2011\n). The Nunavut government also produced a report on engineering \nchallenges for coastal infrastructure, including docks, in relation to the impacts of climate change \n\n(Journeaux Assoc., 2012).  Adaptation work is ongoing in the Yukon, particularly at Yukon College \n\nand through the Yukon Climate Change Secretariat (\nNorthern Climate ExChange, 2014a and 2014b)\n. Several of these efforts have been undertaken in collaboration with federal departments, including \n\nTransport Canada and Natural Resources Canada.\n2.1 SYSTEM OVERVIEW\nFigure 1 and Table 2 present an overview of transportation routes and infrastructure in Canada™s \n\n\n\ntransportation Œ road transport, aviation, marine transport, and rail Œ in greater depth.\n', ' 32CHAPTER 3: NORTHERN TERRITORIES\n 32Figure 1: Map of principle transportation infrastructure in northern Canada.  \nNote that the National Road Network includes winter roads. \nTable 2: Transportation networks in the territories at a glance.\nYukon\nNorthwest Territories\nNunavutHighways 4,800 km of all-weather roads \n -1,069 km of National \nHighway Core Routes \n -5% paved -40% chip-sealed -Remainder is gravel 129 bridges With the exception of \n\nOld Crow, each Yukon \n\ncommunity is connected to the highway 2,200 km of all-weather roads\n -576 km of National Highway Core Routes \n -45% paved/chip-sealed -27% gravel Over 300 bridges 4 ferry crossings (Highways \n\n1 and 8) with operations \nfrom May/June to October/\nDecember  1,625 km of publicly constructed winter road\n Privately constructed / \n\nmaintained winter roads, \n\nincluding the 570-km Tibbitt to \nContwoyto winter road, used \nby both industry and the public No roads connecting \n\ncommunities Each community has a \nseries of access trails that \nand camping areas\n No winter road system to \ndate', ' 33CHAPTER 3: NORTHERN TERRITORIES\n 33Yukon\nNorthwest Territories\nNunavutAirports 4 airports and 25 aerodromes\n2  -1 international hub \n\n(Whitehorse) -2 airports (Whitehorse and \nWatson Lake) have paved \n\nrunways; all others have \ngravel airstrips 27 airports -The hub (Yellowknife), \n\nconnects to the provinces \n\nas well as communities \nwithin the Northwest \nTerritories\n -2 regional hubs (Norman \n\nWells and Inuvik)\n -24 community airports  -6 airports with paved \n\nrunways; all others are gravel\n 25 airports  -2 airports (Iqaluit \n\nInternational and \n\nRankin Inlet) with \n\npaved runways; all \n\nothers are gravel \nMarine  Links to the marine \ntransportation network via \nAlaska through ports such as \n\nSkagway, AK and Haines, YT  Privately operated resupply \n\ntugboats and barges serving \nindustry, residents, and \n\ndelivering fuel for electricity \ngeneration Privately operated supply \nbarges to communities\n Federal installations \nexploration camps and Arctic \n\ncommunities River transportation (including \nthe Mackenzie River) is \nespecially important for \ncommunity resupply and \n\ndelivering fuel to industry and \nresidents \n Pangnirtung has a small \ncraft harbour which \n\n\nbreakwater and sea lift \n\nramp No other community has \nharbour facilities  Marine access plays a \nvital role for community \n\nresupply; however few \n\ncommunities have \ndocking facilities Rail Limited rail in the Yukon for \n\ntourism purposes  The Mackenzie Northern \n\nRailway is used for the \ntransport of bulk commodities \nfrom Alberta into Hay River \n\nand Enterprise  Currently no railways in \n\nNunavut 2.2 ROAD TRANSPORTATION\n2In the Yukon, the land-based transportation network is relatively well-developed, with roads \nconnecting all communities but one (Old Crow, the territory™s most northerly community, is linked to \n\nthe continental mainland only seasonally via winter roads extending to Inuvik and Alaska). In contrast, \n\nfew communities in the Northwest Territories and no communities in Nunavut are connected to \n\nsouthern Canada via the national highway system (Prolog Canada Inc., 2011). The all-weather road \n\nsystem in the Northwest Territories is being expanded through construction of a road from Tuktoyaktuk \n\nto Inuvik (expected to be completed in 2018) (Government of Northwest Territories, 2015a). In \n\naddition, ferry services have been added on the Peel and Mackenzie Rivers, and there are plans to \n\nextend the all-weather Mackenzie Highway further north. This highway extension would reduce the \n\n\n\nWrigley to Tuktoyaktuk (Yukon Government et al, 2008).\n2  Aerodrome: Any area of land, water (including the frozen surface thereof) or other supporting surface used or designed, pre\n-pared, equipped or set apart for use either in whole or in part for the arrival, departure, movement or servicing of aircraft and \n\nincludes any buildings, installations and equipment situated thereon or associated therewith. (Transport Canada, 2014)\n', ' 34CHAPTER 3: NORTHERN TERRITORIES\n 34As discussed, winter roads constitute an important component of northern Canada™s surface \ntransportation network. Goods transported include bulk fuel, dry goods, building material and other \n\nitems with a maximum truck load capacity of 64,000 kg (Federal, Provincial, and Territorial Sub-\n\nWorking Group on Northern Transportation, 2015). In the Yukon, winter roads facilitate community \n\ntransportation (Deton™Cho-Stantec, 2013). There is no winter road system in Nunavut; however, the \n\nGovernment of Nunavut is assessing the feasibility of developing a seasonal network connecting \n\nthe Kivalliq region with northern Manitoba (Brownie, 2013). Winter roads are much less costly than \n\nall-weather roads, and have a much smaller environmental footprint (Transportation Association of \n\nCanada, 2010). While a 9m-wide all-weather road in the Northwest Territories can range from CAD$1.2 \n\nmillion to CAD$1.5 million per km (with maintenance costs up to CAD$15,000/km/year), winter roads \n\nrange in cost from CAD$10,000 to CAD$20,000/km/season to open and operate (Transportation \n\nAssociation of Canada, 2010).   \nFigure 2:  Road network in the Yukon and Northwest Territories.\n2.3 AVIATION\nFor communities not connected by all-weather or winter roads, air transportation is vital. This is \n\nespecially true in Nunavut and the Northwest Territories, where aviation ensures community resupply \n\nand transportation year-round. To illustrate its predominance, consider that more than 110,000 people \n\ndeparted from and disembarked at the Iqaluit airport in 2006, despite a population of approximately \n\n6,000 at the time (Dunlavy et al., 2009). While Yukon communities are not as heavily dependent \n\non air travel due to the territory™s extensive road network, aviation remains important for isolated \n\ncommunities like Old Crow. \n', ' 35CHAPTER 3: NORTHERN TERRITORIES\n 35While some runways in the territories are paved, the vast majority are gravel. Paved and gravel \nrunways have different sensitivities to climate (in particular to changes in ground conditions), and \n\ntherefore require different adaptation methods. However, while gravel runways may be easier to \n\n\n\nsurfaces (Parliament of Canada, 2011). The Boeing 737-200, which has not been manufactured since \n\nthe 1980s, is the most modern gravel-kitted aircraft. However, this model has higher fuel consumption \n\nand upkeep costs compared to more modern aircraft (Parliament of Canada, 2011).\n2.4 MARINE TRANSPORTATION\nMarine transportation is also important for community resupply (e.g., the transportation of food and \n\nfuel) during shipping months in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut. Despite its coastline along \n\nthe Beaufort Sea, the Yukon has no marine-based facilities, although there is docking infrastructure \n\nalong the Yukon River. While marine shipping is more cost-effective than air shipping in Nunavut, it \n\n\n\nBay has basic facilities, and only Pangnirtung has a harbour facility. Inland marine transportation \n\n\n\nsupplies by barge and tanker to support the construction and operation of the Meadowbank gold \n\nmine (Transportation Safety Board of Canada, 2012). There are also plans to expand marine usage in \n\nsome places. At Pond Inlet, a new marine and small craft harbour is planned; this would increase the \n\ncommunity™s capacity for resupply of food, fuel and other goods (Government of Canada, 2015). \n\nAdditionally, the Iqaluit Marine Infrastructure Project Œ involving the construction of a port and sea lift \n\n\nThe Northwest Territories has an extensive network of river transportation vessels and facilities used for \ncommunity resupply. The Mackenzie River acts as an important cargo shipment route for transporting \n\ngoods to communities along the river, the Mackenzie Delta, the coast of the Beaufort Sea and the \n\ninterior of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (Deton™Cho-Stantec, 2013). Additionally, some suggest \n\nthat marine facilities in Tuktoyaktuk harbour once used to support oil and gas activities in the Beaufort \n\nSea could be revamped to support offshore activity and search and rescue operations (Matthews, \n\n2014). However, the port is not suitable for larger vessels and currently features a shallow 32-km \n\nchannel approach with sections less than 4m deep (Prolog Canada Inc, 2011).\n2.5 RAIL TRANSPORTATION\nRail infrastructure is limited in the territories, but provides important services in some locations. \n\nFor example, Canadian National (CN) Railway runs one return bulk commodity train daily to \n\nEnterprise and Hay River, Northwest Territories, that supplies the community and mining industry \n\n(Yukon Government et al, 2008). The line is one of the most costly routes in CN™s network due to the \n\nchallenging area of service; for instance, the rail bed is constructed on permafrost, which limits train \n\nspeed (Government of Northwest Territories, 2015a). Maintaining this service is important, however Œ \n\nover half of all bulk commodities entering the territory do so by rail (e.g., petroleum, agriculture and \n\nforest products) (Government of Northwest Territories, 2011).\nThe only rail line operating in the Yukon is the White Pass and Yukon Route, which operates as a \ntourist train from Carcross, Yukon to Skagway, Alaska (White Pass and Yukon Route, 2015). However, \n\nthis may change: a study has been completed investigating the feasibility of a rail link from Alaska \n\nand the Yukon to the North American rail grid. This route would provide an alternative North \n\n\n\nGovernment et al, 2008).\n', ' 36CHAPTER 3: NORTHERN TERRITORIES\n 363.0 CLIMATE\nCanada™s northern territories are characterized by long cold winters interrupted by short, relatively \ncool, summers. Precipitation is light, particularly in the western and northern parts of the region, and \n\noccurs predominantly in the summer months.  There is great regional variability in both seasonal \n\ntemperatures and precipitation. For example, average winter temperatures in the northern part of the \n\n\n\n\n\ndecades is high.A critical component of the northern climate system is the cryosphere Œ terrestrial, freshwater, and \nmarine areas that are seasonally or permanently frozen. This includes snow, glaciers, and permafrost, \n\nas well as lake, river and sea ice. Many of the most dramatic climate change impacts observed in \n\n\n\nnorthern climate system is the marine climate. While changes in ocean temperature, salinity, and \n\nother parameters have important implications for northern ecosystems and traditional ways of life, this \n\nchapter only considers changes in sea level as it affects coastal transportation infrastructure.\n3.1 TRENDS AND PROJECTIONS3.1.1 ATMOSPHERE\nArctic regions have warmed, and will continue \nto warm, more rapidly than most regions of the \n\nworld, due in part to the phenomenon known \n\n\n\nNorth has already experienced some of the most \n\n\n\nobserved anywhere on the planet (Bush, et al., \n\n\n\nperiod 1948-2014, has occurred in the Northwest \n\nTerritories™ Mackenzie District (Environment Canada, \n\n2015).

While the region is dominated by \n\ncold air masses in winter, increased variability in the jetstream in recent years (Francis and Vavrus, \n\n2012) has resulted in more winter warm-air advection events in the North (winds blowing from \n\nwarmer regions) (Wang, 2006). This can bring freezing rain, fog and melt events, which cause \n\nproblems for transportation systems. Climate projections indicate that precipitation will continue \n\nto increase under all scenarios, with the greatest increases in fall and winter. Winter precipitation \n\nincreases greater than 25 percent are projected for parts of the eastern and central Arctic by the \n\nyear 2050 (Bush et al., 2014). \nThere is strong evidence that the frequency and intensity of storms in the Arctic is increasing (Manson \nand Solomon, 2007). Increasingly-large areas of open water result in more intense cyclonic storms \n\nŒ these storms will grow larger and stronger as sea-ice extent is projected to decrease even further \n\n\n\nBay storm track. There are many recent examples of severe wind events, including a 2006 event in \n\nPangnirtung, Nunavut, where winds reaching 125 km/hr destroyed a building and broke windows \n\n(Hanesiak et al., 2010). During a similar 2007 event in Iqaluit, Nunavut, winds reaching up to 140 km/hr \n\ntore sections off the roofs of multiple buildings (Hanesiak et al., 2010). Storm surges, where water levels \n\nexceed predicted tide levels due to atmospheric pressure and winds associated with storms, are of \n\nparticular concern along the Beaufort Sea coast due to its shallow depth. Several sites in that region \n\nhave recorded storm surges in excess of 2 m (Forbes and Frobel, 1985), with impacts extending 30 km \n\ninland on the Mackenzie Delta (Kokelj, et al., 2012).

These changes include decreases in \n\nthe extent and duration of snow cover over the past 40 years, and a strong shift towards negative \n\nmass balance (loss of ice volume) in Arctic glaciers and ice caps since 2005 (Derksen et al., 2012). \n\nOf particular relevance to northern transportation are changes in sea ice, permafrost, and river \n\nand lake ice cover.\n\ncover is essentially complete, the coast is protected from wave action, and ice permits transportation \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Prowse, et al, 2009). \nFor the Arctic as a whole, the average extent of sea ice in the month of September is decreasing \nat a rate of 13.3 percent per decade, while March extent is decreasing at a rate of 2.6 percent per \n\ndecade (National Snow and Ice Data Centre, 2016) (Figures 4a, b, c). In the Canadian Arctic, the \n\nrate of loss ranges from 2.9 percent per decade in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (CAA) (although \n\nareas within the CAA have much higher rates) to 10.4 percent per decade in Hudson Bay (Tivy, et \n\nal., 2011). This decline in sea-ice cover has resulted in a lengthening of the open-water season by an \n\n\nper decade in the Canadian North. For example, in Resolute Bay, Nunavut, the melt season has \nincreased by close to 30\n days over a 30-year period, driven primarily by a delay in freeze-up (St-\nHilaire-Gravel et al., 2011). The decrease in the extent of sea ice means that larger and more powerful \n\nwaves are reaching the coast (Overeem et al, 2011). This in turn, leads to increased erosion and \n\n\n\nin September, which is often also the stormiest period of the year (Atkinson, 2005).\n', ' 38CHAPTER 3: NORTHERN TERRITORIES\n 38These trends in sea-ice cover are expected to \ncontinue or accelerate (Vaughn et al., 2013), with \n\nsome models projecting almost complete loss of \n\nsummer ice cover before mid-century (Wang and \n\nOverland, 2012). Arctic sea ice is also thinning, \n\nwith the average spring ice thickness projected \n\nto decrease from 2.4 m in 2008 (Kwok et al., 2009) \n\nto 1.4 m by 2050 (Stroeve et al., 2012).\nFigures 4a, b, c: Changes in Arctic sea ice \nextent since 1981.

Permafrost \n\ncan be up to several hundred metres thick, but may be only tens of metres thick or less in more southerly \n\nparts of the permafrost zone. Above the permafrost, a surface layer (known as the active layer) thaws \n\nin summer and refreezes in winter. The active layer can range from tens of centimetres to several metres \n\nin thickness. Climate (including air temperature and snow cover) is the main factor controlling the \n\noccurrence and thermal state of permafrost. Changes in climate can result in permafrost warming and \n\nthaw.  Warming of permafrost reduces the structural integrity of infrastructure that relies on permafrost \n\nfor a stable foundation, while thawing of ice-rich permafrost leads to surface subsidence (sinking), \n\nhydrological changes and slope instability. This presents risks to infrastructure, roads, airstrips, and railways. \nA number of comprehensive overviews of the state of permafrost in Canada (Burn and Kokelji, \n2009) indicate that, with few exceptions, permafrost temperatures are increasing. Generally, colder \n\npermafrost situated further north has seen greater increases in temperature than warmer permafrost. \n\n\n\n\n\nrates appear to be increasing, with data for the period 2008 to 2013 showing average warming of \n\n\n\nwarming is also associated with an increase in the thickness of the seasonal active layer. \nThese trends are projected to continue as the climate continues to warm (Woo et al., 2007). \nRegions that experience the greatest thermal responses, however, are not necessarily the ones \n\nthat exhibit the greatest physical impacts (Smith and Burgess, 2004). For example, where there is \n\na large increase in ground temperature but very low ground ice content, the physical impacts of \n\npermafrost warming will be minimal.\n', ' 40CHAPTER 3: NORTHERN TERRITORIES\n 40\nup and break-up dates of river and lake ice, \n\nwhile changes in both air temperature and snow \n\ncover affect ice thickness (Brown and Duguay, \n\n2010).  Duration and thickness of ice cover are \n\ncritical for the sustainability of many winter roads \n\nin Canada™s northern territories. Delayed freeze-\n\nup, and earlier break-up dates observed in recent \n\nyears are projected to continue, with simulations \n\nsuggesting that by mid-century freeze-up will \n\noccur about 15 days later than it has historically, \nand that break-up will occur 5 to 25 days earlier. \n\nFor the same period, maximum ice thicknesses are \n\nprojected to decrease by 20 to 30 cm (Brown and \n\nDuguay, 2010).3.1.3 SEA LEVEL \nSea level changes in Canada™s northern \n\nterritories are dominated by vertical land \n\nmotion that has been ongoing since the last \n\nglaciation, when the land beneath ice sheets \n\nwas depressed hundreds of metres, and has \n\nslowly been rebounding back over thousands of \n\nyears (Atkinson et al., 2016). This phenomenon, \n\nknown as glacial isostatic adjustment, results \n\nin observed sea level falling across most of the \n\nCanadian Arctic, despite the fact that global \n\nmean sea level has risen. An important exception \n\nis the Mackenzie Delta/Beaufort region of the \n\nwestern Arctic that lay near the margin of the \n\nlast ice sheet and is experiencing sea level rise \n\nas a result. Tide-gauge records covering the past \n\n50 years indicate that sea level has risen 2.4 mm/\nyear at Tuktoyaktuk, NT, but fallen by 1.5 mm/\n\nyear at Alert, Nunavut (Ford et al, 2016).\nFuture patterns of sea level change will be \nsimilar to historic patterns, with the magnitude \n\n\n\ngas emissions and associated increases in mean \n\nglobal sea level.  Where the land is currently \n\nrising rapidly, future sea level is projected to \n\ncontinue to fall, even under a high greenhouse-\n\ngas emissions scenario, and some locations \n\ncould experience more than 80 cm of sea-level \n\nfall by 2100 (Figure 6). Where the land is sinking \n\nslowly, including the Mackenzie Delta/Beaufort \n\nregion, sea level is projected to rise more than \n\n40 cm by 2100.  While not all of this change is \n\ndue to a changing climate, adaptation will still \n\nbe required. \nFigure 5: Mean annual ground temperature \n(MAGT) across northern Canada recorded \n\nduring the International Polar Year (2007-09). \n B and C show permafrost temperature \n\nstandardized anomaly time series (relative to \n\n1988-2007 mean) for a site near Norman Wells \n\n(12 m depth) and at Alert (15 m depth). \n (Source: Derksen et al., 2012)\nFigure 6: Projected median relative sea-level \nchange in 2100 for a high greenhouse gas \n\nemissions scenario (RCP8.5; after James et \nal., 2014).

While operating \n\nwindows have always varied by location and year, recent increases in surface air temperature and \n\ndecreases in snow cover have reduced operating season length and maximum load capacity \n\nin many locations (Furgal and Prowse, 2008). This resulted in a costly adjustment in 2006, when \n\napproximately 1,200 loads had to be transported by air during the summer and fall following a \n\nshortened winter-road season on the Tibbitt to Contwoyto Winter Road (Andrey et al., 2014). \n\nintegrity of winter roads, bridges at stream crossings, and culverts.

This \n\nwill have implications for roads, bridges at stream crossings, and slope stability. Territorial governments \n\nare aware of these risks and have been taking steps to increase the structural integrity of the ground \n\nunderlying transportation infrastructure (discussed further in Section 4.3). In addition, snowfall and \n\nwinter storm events limit visibility for drivers, and may result in road closures.\n4.2.2 WINTER ROADSAs the climate warms, winter roads in the Canadian North, both public and private, are at risk due \n\nto shortened operating seasons and increased costs. Thinner lake, river, and marine ice will have \n\na negative impact on the seasonal duration and stability of winter roads (Bush, et al., 2014), while \n\nchanging permafrost conditions could impact the viability and structural integrity of some routes \n\n(McGregor et al., 2008).\nThe trend towards shorter operational seasons is already evident. For example, the average opening \n\n\nby more than 3 weeks since 1996 (Frugal and Prowse, 2008). In the future, some winter routes \n\nmay become impractical, although timing and locations have yet to be determined.

Ground-penetrating radar is used to measure ice thickness. \n Construction of the road takes approximately 5 to 6 weeks prior to opening each year.\n The TCWR is typically operational for 8 to 10 weeks, starting between January 26 and February 11 and \n\nending between March 21 and April 16.\nClimate trends: \nAnalysis of regional climate data demonstrates that the TCWR™s operating season length \ncorrelates with temperature and related variables, including freezing-degree days, melting-degree days, and \n\nice thickness Œ of these, the strongest indicator of a longer season is the accumulation of freezing-degree days. \n\n\n\nfreezing-degree days and observed annual maximum ice thickness have both decreased, while melting-\ndegree days have increased. \nCASE STUDY 1–Figure 8: Map of the TCWR™s route through the \nNorthwest Territories and Nunavut.\n (Source: Tibbitt \nto Contwoyto Winter Road Joint Venture)\nFigure 9: Historical average temperatures \n\n\nnormal periods. \n(Source: Environment and \nClimate Change Canada)', ' 44CHAPTER 3: NORTHERN TERRITORIES\n 444.3 ADAPTATION PRACTICES\nAdaptation practices for roads vary by season and type of road (e.g., all-weather vs. winter). \nGenerally, adaptation approaches for northern roads fall under three major categories: maintenance \n\nand monitoring practices; infrastructure planning and siting; and construction techniques and \n\ntechnologies. \n4.3.1 MAINTENANCE AND MONITORING PRACTICES4.3.1.1 All-weather roads\nOngoing monitoring of infrastructure conditions is important for identifying maintenance priorities, in \npreparation for gradual climatic changes and extreme weather events. In areas at risk of permafrost \n\nthaw, all-weather roads can be maintained through several methods, including clearing snow from \n\nvulnerable sections of roads built on permafrost (e.g., side slopes); conducting alternative routing \n\nassessments prior to reconstruction; and road-shoulder widening (Transportation Association of \n\nCanada, 2010). Culverts experiencing accelerated permafrost degradation can be replaced or \n\nexpanded if runoff capacity is exceeded, and accompanying ditching/drainage may be enhanced \n\nin this event as well (Deton™Cho-Stantec, 2013). As permafrost thaws, all-weather roads that carry \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFuture projections are consistent with observed trends. Climate change scenarios (in the absence of \nadaptation measures) project that the length of the winter road operating season will decrease from \n\napproximately 65 days in 2010 to 58 days by 2020 and 49 days by 2050 (with a 6 to 8 day margin of error \n\nper season).Adaptation costs: It is possible that the winter road will remain viable through 2050, although there may \n\nrequirements.

Improved understanding \n\nof climate thresholds and associated costs for road owners and users may help to inform future economic \n\nand vulnerability assessments for winter roads.\n\n3 These estimates represent net present values in 2015 dollars with a 4% discount rate applied.\n–', ' 45CHAPTER 3: NORTHERN TERRITORIES\n 454.3.1.2 Winter roads\nPractices to maintain the integrity of winter roads include the pre-emptive removal of snow, as \nwell as the construction and maintenance of snow caches (stockpiles of snow used as supporting \n\nmaterial for degraded segments of winter roads). Snow removal allows freezing fronts to penetrate \n\nthe ground faster, removing heat from the ground and promoting ice formation, while snow caches \n\n\n\n\n\nremoval of water away from the infrastructure (Deton™Cho-Stantec, 2013). Operational practices \n\ninclude spraying winter roads and bridges with water to thicken ice and delay closure. Towards the \n\nend of the operating season, some operators also restrict hauling to nighttime, when the ice sheet is \n\nstronger (Rawlings et al., 2009).\nSeveral organizations have produced guiding documents to assist practitioners in the construction \nand maintenance of winter roads, including the Transportation Association of Canada (2011), the \n\nGovernment of the Northwest Territories (2015b and 2015c), the Canadian Standards Association \n\nGroup (CSA, 2010), and the Standards Council of Canada™s Northern Infrastructure Standardization \n\nInitiative (2015). These guidelines discuss general ice safety, ice behaviour under loading, ice-cover \n\nmanagement, and end-of-season management (among others). Methods to deal with ice cracking \n\nare also covered in detail to ensure the safety of crossing frozen bodies of water; these risks to roads \n\ncan be mitigated over the long term by establishing permanent crossings, including bridges over \n\nﬁchoke pointsﬂ (points of congestion created by the layout of a network) (Rawlings et al., 2009). \n\nFor example, the Deh Cho Bridge, which crosses a 1 km-wide section of the Mackenzie River, is \n\ndesigned to eliminate seasonal disruptions to road transportation when ice bridges and ferry services \n\n\n\nice, temporary culvert crossings may also be converted to permanent culverts, including systems to \n\n\n\nroutes can be considered when segments of roadway become unreliable (Deton Cho-Stantec, 2013) \n\n(e.g., increasing the use of barge transportation, or constructing more expensive all-weather roads) \n\n(Furgal and Prowse, 2008).\n4.3.2 INFRASTRUCTURE PLANNING/SITING \nThe location of infrastructure is an important consideration for decision-makers, engineers, and \n\nplanners in northern Canada. Critical baseline information includes data regarding local climate, \n\npermafrost conditions/sensitivity, and terrain constraints. Permafrost mapping and geotechnical \n\nmonitoring, including assessments of soil type and ground ice content, are also conducted to avoid \n\nconstruction on overly sensitive ground (IMG-Golder Corporation Environmental Consulting, 2012). \n\nImprovements to permafrost databases and analysis of permafrost conditions could further support \n\nterritorial governments in planning and decision-making, to permit greater understanding of methods \n\nto maintain transportation infrastructure on permafrost (Environment Yukon, 2009). Databases of this \n\nnature are maintained by the Geological Survey of Canada. \nMany of the guidance documents discussed previously are also useful when identifying optimal \nlocations for both all-season and winter roads. Additionally, land-use guidelines applicable to road \n\nconstruction have been developed. These encourage proponents to consider northern Canada™s \n\nunique topography (i.e. pingos4 and permafrost), drainage, and vegetation, along with the social \nand economic impacts of proposed roadways, during project planning and design (Aboriginal Affairs \n\nand Northern Development Canada, 2010). \n4  Referring to hills of rock and soil with ice cores that occur in permafrost-rich areas of the Arctic.\n', ' 46CHAPTER 3: NORTHERN TERRITORIES\n 464.3.3 CONSTRUCTION TECHNIQUES AND TECHNOLOGIES FOR ALL-WEATHER ROADS\nSeveral methods have been developed to preserve permafrost during construction (see Figure 10 \nand Case study 2) (Beaulac and Doré, 2006).

These systems, \n\nwhich have been used in the territories and northern Quebec, have been shown to cool the \n\nground, raise the permafrost table, and stabilize foundations over time (Montufar, et al. 2011). While \n\nthere have been problems with poorly functioning thermosyphons in the territories, these have \n\nbeen attributed to poor installation and maintenance.

Similar to road infrastructure, rail track is particularly vulnerable to the effects of permafrost \n\ndegradation. Thawing may cause heaving, sinkholes, potholes and settlement issues for railways in \n\nnorthern Canada (IMG-Golder Corporation Environmental Consulting, 2012). Associated adaptations \n\ncan either be active, removing heat from the embankment, or passive, reducing heat absorption \n\n(Ferrell and Lautala, 2010). Some engineering solutions for roads can also be applied to rail \n\ninfrastructure, including embankment widening and the installation of thermosyphons, snow sheds, \n\nand insulation. The following methods may also be used: \n Ventiduct embankments\n refer to pipes placed alongside the traditional soil embankment, \n\nallowing air to pass through the embankment and drawing heat from the soil. In order to reduce \n\nheat absorption of the soil during the summer months, these pipes can be sealed (Ferrell and \n\nLautala, 2010). Stone embankments are used to create pore space within embankments and allow air to \npenetrate the structure and natural convection to remove heat from the subgrade (Ferrell and \n\nLautala, 2010). Snow/sun sheds reduce snow accumulation and solar radiation on the embankment. They can \n\n\n\nand Lautala, 2010).Extreme weather can damage embankments and create washouts and soil/rock slides, which may \n\nresult in rail line closures (IMG-Golder Corporation Environmental Consulting, 2012). The incorporation \n\nof higher-capacity culverts for embankments and bridges can mitigate the effects of seasonal \n\ndrainage and extreme events (IMG-Golder Corporation Environmental Consulting, 2012). Some rail \n\ncompanies also have winter operating plans that include snow removal, sanding and salting, track \n\nand wheel inspections, temporary slow orders, and personnel training initiatives (Lemmen and Warren, \n\n2004). Although rail transport is limited in Canada™s North, greater rail infrastructure development may \n\nbe feasible in the future (Yukon Government, 2013).

For example, extreme fog and condensation can \n\n\n\n\n\nfrequent in the territories, resulting in reduced visibility at airports (Deton™Cho-Stantec, 2013). With few \n\ncommunities possessing navigational systems, this makes approaches to airports more challenging. \n\nFor example, as of 2013, eight airports in the Northwest Territories did not have the navigational \n\nsystems in place to assist pilots in landing during their approach. Thus, under extreme fog conditions, \n\nthese airports are forced to suspend operations. For example, the airport in Wekweeti, Northwest \n\nTerritories, was shut down for a week in September 2011 due to dense fog (Deton™Cho-Stantec, 2013). \nRain and freezing rain can also have an impact operations by decreasing traction on runways and \n\n\n\n\nwere unable to keep the runway clear (Deton™Cho-Stantec, 2013). In addition, similar to all-weather \n\nand winter roads, changing air temperatures can impact the structural integrity of permafrost under \n\nrunways and taxiways. \nGravel runways and taxiways also present unique challenges for aviation in northern Canada, as they \n\n\nCanada, 2016). The weakening of these surfaces may limit or completely halt runway operations \n\n(Transport Canada, 2016). This exacerbates another capacity issue: many airstrips in northern Canada \n\ncan only accommodate relatively small aircraft (Parliament of Canada, 2011).\nTable 4: Overview of climate and extreme weather impacts on air transportation.\nClimatic factorImpact on aviationAir Temperature\nPermafrost degradation can damage and degrade runways/taxiways (Government of \nNunavut et al., 2011).Snow\n\nrunways/taxiways (Deton™Cho-Stantec, 2013).\n(e.g., via the accumulation of snow on runways) (Hanesiak et al., 2009).RainfallIncreased rainfall can reduce traction on runways/taxiways (Best, et al., 2014). \n\nto experience issues with braking and sliding off airstrips (IMG-Golder Corporation \nEnvironmental Consulting, 2012). \nFogIncreased fog episodes may require additional training and procedures for airport \n\npersonnel in order to ensure safety (Deton™Cho-Stantec, 2013).\n\n', ' 52CHAPTER 3: NORTHERN TERRITORIES\n 526.2 FUTURE RISKSRising air temperatures will continue to affect permafrost conditions, presenting a risk to the integrity of \nboth gravel and paved runways. Increased precipitation may lead to reduced traction and visibility. \n\nThese changes will increasingly affect the planning, design, and maintenance of airports in the North.  \nFinally, weather extremes associated with increasing and varying wind speeds, are expected to affect \nairports. For example, high winds contribute to severe blizzards and snowstorms that limit visibility and \n\nhave the potential to slow down airport operations. These issues are summarized in Table 4.\n6.3 ADAPTATION PRACTICES\nMethods to address permafrost degradation affecting paved runway and taxiway issues are similar \n\nto those for all-weather roads given the similarities between these types of infrastructure (see Case \n\nstudy 3). Generally, airports in the North are reacting to these changes in the absence of long-term \n\nstrategic planning.Airports that have gravel runways can correct for ground settlement resulting from permafrost thaw \nby adding material to the runway/taxiway. Gravel is easier to resurface/grind up and replace in \n\ncomparison to pavement (Deton™Cho-Stantec, 2013). Gravel runways can also be reconstructed \n\nwithout having to transport heavy specialized equipment to the location. \nIn cases of heavy precipitation, grooving on paved runways and taxiways can improve traction and \ndrainage. This method has been applied at Norman Wells Airport in the Northwest Territories in order \n\nto increase drainage and improve surface friction (Deton™Cho-Stantec, 2013). The cost of grooving \n\nvaries depending on the type of runway material (e.g., concrete or asphalt), the type and size of \n\naggregate (e.g., limestone, gravel, etc.), the age and condition of the runway surface, the size of \n\nthe project, and local factor costs (e.g., fuel costs, support equipment, mobilization costs) (Best et \n\nal., 2014). While runway grooving has been shown to enhance water drainage, improve friction, and \n\nreduce sanding requirements, this technique is relatively costly (Deton™Cho-Stantec, 2013). In the \n\n\n\nheavy machinery has been employed to remove pooling water.\nAirports have been increasingly applying sand to surfaces in order to counter the effects of standing \nwater and freezing rain. Sand requirements have been growing Œ for instance, Norman Wells Airport \n\nincreased its use of sand from 10 to 15 tonnes per year prior to 2000 to over 150 tonnes per year in \n\n2012 (Deton™Cho-Stantec, 2013).Airports attempt to mitigate the impacts of high snowfall on permafrost (thermal insulation) by \nremoving snow as quickly as possible. In order for airplanes to operate during periods of heavy \n\nsnowfall, airport personnel continuously clear runways and taxiways to allow airplanes to take off and \n\nland safely. \nDe-icing agents are used commonly at northern airports to address aircraft wing contamination \n(e.g., by ice, snow, or freezing rain) (Deton™Cho-Stantec, 2013). De-icing agents can also be used \n\nto clear contaminants from runways and taxiways. These products contain glycol, and it has been \n\nsuggested that runoff from these compounds may result in warmer ground temperatures and other \n\nenvironmental impacts. There have been calls for the development of a glycol management strategy \n\nas the volume of glycol used at northern airports increases (Deton™Cho-Stantec, 2013).\n', ' 53CHAPTER 3: NORTHERN TERRITORIES\n 537.0 MARINE TRANSPORTATION\n7.1 CLIMATE IMPACTS ON MARINE TRANSPORTATION (INCLUDING LAKES AND RIVERS)\nClimate factors affecting marine transportation in northern Canada include: changing patterns of sea \nice; precipitation events; strong and variable winds; and changing water levels. \nAs discussed in Section 4, recent decades have seen dramatic changes in the Arctic sea-ice regime \n(Bush et al., 2014; Dawson et al., 2014). While decreases in the extent and duration of sea ice present \n\n\n\nseveral barriers remain for Arctic shipping expansion. For example, the high year-to-year variability \n\n\n\nconstruction standards (Ellis and Brigham, 2009). Few year-round commercial navigational vessels \n\ncurrently operate in the Canadian Arctic (with the exception of nuclear icebreakers) (Ellis and \n\nBrigham, 2009).Sea ice changes are also associated with coastal erosion, navigation problems, and infrastructure \ndamage. Changing distributions of multi-year ice have led to ice detaching and migrating into \n\nunexpected areas, creating obstacles and hazards for cargo vessels (Deton™Cho-Stantec, 2013). \n\nThis has implications for search and rescue capacity, winter shipping, passenger safety, and coastal \nCASE STUDY 3: INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS AT IQALUIT \nINTERNATIONAL AIRPORT\nIqaluit International Airport is extremely important to communities in Nunavut given the region™s lack of road \naccess. When the airport was constructed in 1942, little was known about the underlying permafrost and its \n\nimportance to the safety and viability of airport operations. However, many problems related to permafrost Œ \nincluding runway stability issues stemming from thaw settlement of ice-rich soils Œ have occurred at the airport \nover its lifespan. In tandem with the need for expansion and facility replacement, permafrost issues prompted \n\nthe development of an improvement plan by public and private partners.\nIn 2013-2014, the \nIqaluit International Airport Improvement Project\n was initiated; by then, the importance \n\nunderstood. A number of research projects were undertaken, employing a variety of techniques Œ including \n\n\n\n\n\nsubject to greater warming under pavement than embankments (and other ﬁnaturalizedﬂ surfaces).  \nThe data collected has been used to inform infrastructure decision-making. Maps were produced to identify \npotentially-problematic locations for existing and proposed infrastructure (e.g., thaw-sensitive soils and/\n\ndamage; the importance of removing thick snow cover in key areas was recognized; thermosyphons were \n\n\n\ninto permafrost.

Currently, large icebergs are tracked using satellite and \naerial surveys to limit potential complications (National Snow and Ice Data Centre, 2016). \nDecreasing sea ice also creates larger expanses and longer durations of open water, which worsens \n\n\nmaneuvering through narrow channels (IMG-Golder Corporation Environmental Consulting, 2012). \n\nChanging ice conditions can also increase the vulnerability of northern communities: recent ice \n\nconditions in the Canadian Arctic have held up the annual resupply of fuel and goods in some \n\ncommunities in Nunavut, for example (CBC News, 2015a).\n\n\ntemporarily suspending operations (Deton™Cho-Stantec, 2013). Strong winds associated with storms \n\ncan also cause navigational challenges, especially in narrow channels and dockings, due to ice \n\njams, ice choke points (i.e. a point of congestion created by ice), and wave action (IMG-Golder \n\nEnvironmental Consulting, 2012).  \nFor river transportation, lower water levels have required the use of lighter barges or smaller loads \nto maintain safety standards, in some cases disrupting operations (Deton™Cho-Stantec, 2013). For \n\nexample, low water levels in the Mackenzie River have delayed the shipment of goods to northern \n\ncommunities in recent years, leaving residents without access to necessary goods and materials until \n\nshipments could be secured through more costly alternatives (such as air or road transport) (CBC \n\nNews, 2015b and 2015c). Permafrost degradation along river banks and sides of valleys has also \n\ncaused slumping and route obstructions in some locations, forcing river transporters to adjust their \n\nroutes (Deton™Cho-Stantec, 2013). \n7.2 FUTURE RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES\nThe Northwest Passage is not expected to \n\nbecome a viable route in the near future due \n\nto ﬁseasonality, ice conditions, a complex \n\narchipelago, draft restrictions, chokepoints, \n\nlack of adequate charts, insurance limitations, \n\nand other costsﬂ (IMG-Golder Environmental \n\nConsulting, 2012) (see Case Studies 4 \n\nand 5). Throughout the northern region, \ndestination shipping is anticipated to increase \n\nto accommodate expanding resource \n\ndevelopment, growing communities, and \n\nincreasing tourism. However, operational costs \n\nwill remain high due to the presence of ice and \n\nassociated expenses (Ellis and Brigham, 2009). \nOver the longer-term, climate projections \nforecast that by midcentury, changing sea \n\nice conditions will enable new routes for ice-\n\nstrengthened ships over the North Pole and \n\nnew routes through the Northwest Passage \n\n(Smith and Stephenson, 2013). If and when the \n\nNorthwest Passage becomes a viable shipping \n\nroute, services such as re-fueling stations, tugs, \n\nand emergency repair will need to be carefully \n\nconsidered.

Full commercial cargo transits have been extremely \n\nlimited, despite the route being touted for its decreased distance, and potential for fuel and cost savings. \n\nThe Nunavik transit took 27 days, about 15 days shorter than a passage through the Panama Canal.

The Beaufort Sea Region (water north \n\nof Canada and Alaska) is estimated to contain 10 billion barrels of oil (Houseknecht et al., 2012), and oil \nand gas companies currently hold licenses for nearly $2 billion (CAD) worth of exploration work over the \nnext 10 years (Ellis and Brigham, 2009).  \nThere remain several challenges associated with resource extraction in the Arctic, including a need to improve \nsafety (i.e. greater search-and-rescue and disaster-response capacity) and supporting infrastructure, as well as \n\nConsulting, 2012). There are also other issues relating to the increasing season and extent of open water, \n\nincluding more frequent dangerous fog conditions, as well as greater wind, wave, and erosion hazards. These \n\nissues are problematic for an area lacking complete hydrographic charts.\nCoastal erosion is also affecting Tuktoyaktuk Island, which protect Tuk Harbour Œ the planned supply and \nsupport base for offshore activity. The island has been receding at a rate of approximately 2m/year. ﬁIf the \n\nisland erodes away or is breached, there is the potential for greater negative effects such as erosion of the \n\ninner harbour coastline or damage to infrastructure during storm surges or normal wave action, especially \nwith rising sea levelsﬂ (Mudge et al., 2011). Ironically, the climate changes that are opening the Beaufort \nSea to exploration and shipping are also likely to make exploration challenging.\n\nCASE STUDY 5', ' 56CHAPTER 3: NORTHERN TERRITORIES\n 56While reduced sea ice may result in greater marine activity over the long term, marine infrastructure \nand operations will remain vulnerable to decreasing sea ice and changes in sea level throughout the \n\n21st century. Despite rising sea levels globally, most of northern Canada is projected to experience a \ndecline in relative sea level due to glacial isostatic adjustment (introduced in Section 4). As a result, \n\nsome areas of northern Canada could face navigation issues such as reduced under-keel depths, as \n\n\n\ncancellations and lower load capacities as a result of unsafe vessel keel depths affect the delivery of \n\ncritical supplies from regional distribution centres to rural communities (White et al., 2007).\nExceptions to this trend include Tuktoyaktuk and Sachs Harbour (in the Northwest Territories), which \nwill experience sea-level rise (James et al., 2014). The risks associated with higher sea levels include \n\ngreater coastal erosion, more intense wave action/sea spray, increased exposure of dock decks, \n\nand higher waves (affecting structures) (IMG-Golder Corporation Environmental Consulting, 2012). \n\nIssues associated with wave erosion and storm surge will increase in these areas as well, as a result of \n\ndecreased sea-ice cover (creating larger stretches of open water) and sea level rise (Case study 5).\nIncreased coastal erosion will necessitate more frequent and costly maintenance and replacement \nof shoreline and coastal infrastructure (Couture et al. 2015). Examples of additional risks from sea \n\nlevel rise include increased wave height (resulting in structural impacts) and increased corrosion of \n\n\n\nincreased under-keel depths in these regions may present opportunities for greater vessel capacity. \nIn short, the opportunities associated with opening transportation routes also come with challenges \nrelated to safety (i.e. greater risks associated with wind, wave, and ice action) and environmental \n\nprotection (i.e. greater shoreline erosion).\n7.3 ADAPTATION PRACTICES\nAdaptation approaches for marine transportation can be categorized into practices for vessels and \n\nnavigation, and those for coastal infrastructure. \n7.3.1 ADAPTATIONS FOR VESSELS AND NAVIGATION\nCommercial shipping in the Arctic over the near term will be mainly limited to seasonal passages \n\nusing vessels suitable for ice conditions that are variable and unpredictable from year to year (White \n\net al., 2007; James et al., 2014; IMG-Golder Corporation Environmental Consulting, 2012). To mitigate \n\nthe risks posed by changing ice conditions, many companies have carried out winter-operation risk \n\n\n\nto vessels can be prevented by careful route planning and operational prudence (Deton™Cho-\n\n\n\nto monitor ice conditions; these include iceNav systems incorporating advanced marine radar, \n\nenhanced target detection radar, and satellite communication technologies for acquiring ice \n\n\n\nequipment (Journeaux, Assoc., 2012). If sea ice has accumulated in a docking area, a tugboat or \n\nthe ship can maneuver back and forth to break the ice (Journeaux, Assoc., 2012). However, the \n\navailability of tugs can be an issue. Risks to propellers and rudders in shallow waters (e.g., during \n\ncommunity re-supply) can be mitigated by using larger and more durable cargo vessels, and \n\n\n\nﬁlighteringﬂ) (Deton™Cho-Stantec, 2013).The Sea-ice Monitoring and Real-Time Information for Coastal Environments (SmartICE) system is an \ninnovative example of an enabling technology that can be used to provide ships travelling through \n\nArctic waters with accurate and timely information about ice conditions (Fournier and Caron-Vuotari, \n\n2013). Developed by the Nain Research Centre, SmartICE combines remote sensing and traditional \n\nInuit knowledge to provide relevant and accessible information on sea-ice thickness, concentration, \n', ' 57CHAPTER 3: NORTHERN TERRITORIES\n 57and roughness to determine safety based on mode, length of trip, trip type (e.g., recreational vs. \nindustry), and other factors (NAIN Research Centre Kaujisapvinga, 2015).\nVessels travelling along rivers often need to reduce cargo loads to allow for travel through shallow \ncoastal areas. In the future, reduced water levels may further affect the cargo capacity of low-\n\ndraft barges (Deton™Cho-Stantec, 2013). In this case, adjusting the loads of some barges may not be \n\n\n\n\n\n(Deton™Cho-Stantec, 2013).Governments have an important role to play in supporting marine navigation. The following services \n\n\nthe deployment and maintenance of navigational aids; the provision of weather and ice information \n\n\n\nGeneral, 2014). In addition, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has developed a Polar \n\nCode, covering a full range of design, construction, equipment, operational, training, search and \n\nrescue and environmental protection matters applicable to ships operating in the waters surrounding \n\nthe two poles (International Maritime Organization, 2016).\n 7.3.2 ADAPTATIONS FOR MARINE FACILITIES\nFor marine infrastructure in the western Arctic\n vulnerable to storm surges and coastal erosion, practices \nto reduce risks may include mapping areas most likely to be affected and constructing defenses to \n\nlimit damage. Coastlines can be protected via the construction of barriers composed of sandbags, \n\nsunken vessels, and rocks and gravel to reduce the impacts of erosive wave action (IMG-Golder \n\nCorporation Environmental Consulting, 2012). However, while sea defense structures help to protect \n\nthe coast, changes in coastal sediment dynamics which may occur as a result of construction or a \n\nchanging climate are important considerations. In some cases, it may be necessary to relocate shore-\n\nbased cargo resupply infrastructure (e.g., fuel manifolds and piping infrastructure) to prevent damage \n\n(Deton™Cho-Stantec, 2013). Studies of sea ice behavior can help determine appropriate dock locations \n\n\nIn the immediate future, piers and mooring structures may require repair and reconstruction as a result \n\nof sea-ice impacts (IMG-Golder Corporation Environmental Consulting, 2012). \nFor facilities along rivers, several adaptation practices have been applied to date. Along the \n\n\ncloser to shore where less erosion has taken place. Gravel ramps have also been re-established to \n\nreplace eroded materials in some locations (Deton™Cho-Stantec, 2013).\nIn some cases, it may be necessary to dredge harbours should water levels decline. This has been \ndone in several northern communities in the past, including Tuktoyaktuk and Hay River (on Great \n\nSlave Lake), to cope with shallow water conditions. However, dredging operations require substantial \n\nresources that can serve as barriers to many communities. For instance, the cost to dredge a deeper \n\nchannel in Tuktoyaktuk to allow the passage of cargo vessels has been estimated in excess of $100 \n\nmillion (Deton™Cho-Stantec, 2013). There may also be a greater need for transferring cargo between \n\nvessels of different sizes to allow passage in shallow harbours, and during high wind events. However, \n\nthis process slows down ships transporting goods to further locations (Deton™Cho-Stantec, 2013).\n', ' 58CHAPTER 3: NORTHERN TERRITORIES\n 588.0 INFORMATION GAPS\nThere are a number of gaps in available information related to the determination of climate \nimpacts on transportation in Canada™s northern region. These include reliable and relevant climate \n\ninformation; available training, guidance and tools; and technical information for infrastructure. \nRegarding climate information, territorial governments and others have expressed interest in \ndeveloping regional climate change scenarios in order to improve understanding of future conditions \n\n(Environment Yukon, 2009). In a survey of mining and transportation practitioners in the Yukon, \n\n\n\nthe data they were using was not appropriate for their area. Projections related to climatic elements \n\nsuch as rain-on-snow events, snow and permafrost interactions, and relationships between snowmelt \n\nand rain are in particular demand (Northern Climate ExChange, 2014b). There are two notable \n\nchallenges to obtaining these climate change scenarios for the territories: limited baseline data is \n\n\n\nand human resources (Government of Nunavut et al., 2011). The limited number of weather stations in \n\nthe North and short duration of climate records also present challenges to developing local climate \n\nchange scenarios. Practitioners have also indicated they lack practical and user-friendly guidance \n\ntools for using climate data, as well as training for practitioners and decision-makers (Northern Climate \n\nExChange, 2014b).Further development of building standards, codes, and community planning information that \n\n\nwould need to consider existing technical guidance on factoring in future climate changes when \n\nbuilding on permafrost (Auld et al., 2010), and expand upon the Standards Council of Canada™s \n\nNorthern Infrastructure Standardization Initiative that has developed standards for: 1) thermosyphon \n\nfoundations (CSA Group, 2014a); 2) moderating the effects of permafrost degradation on building \n\nfoundations (CSA Group, 2014b); 3) managing changing snow-load risks for buildings in Canada™s \n\nNorth (CSA Group, 2014c); and 4) drainage-system planning, design and maintenance in northern \n\ncommunities (CSA Group, 2015). Relevant variables include ground ice content as well as \n\nexperienced and projected ground temperatures and permafrost thicknesses. Such information could \n\nbe used to develop maps identifying areas suitable for infrastructure development (Champalle et al., \n\n2013), and be used at regional and local scales to determine areas with low, moderate, or high levels \n\nof vulnerability (Calmels et al., 2015).Improved channels for information-sharing among northern practitioners and residents is another \nimportant gap. Tools such as the Arctic Adaptation Exchange portal, developed during Canada™s \n\nArctic Council Chairmanship, help facilitate the sharing of adaptation best-practices among \n\ncircumpolar communities (Arctic Adaptation Exchange, 2014). \nFor marine transportation, updating geospatial databases to account for the challenges and \nopportunities presented by a changing climate is important. This involves updating maps and \n\n\n\ncommunity with information and charting strategies to deal with future climate uncertainty. Publicly \n\n\n\nexample, the Coastal Information System (maintained by the Geological Survey of Canada) provides \n\nqualitative coastal changes based on multiple years of video and aerial photography that can be \n\nused by communities experiencing coastal change (Couture et al., 2015). In addition, improved \n\nhydrological monitoring would allow better understanding of the impacts of climate change on runoff \n\n\n\nthe Northwest Territories. Lastly, improved water level monitoring, including a water level-monitoring \n\n\n\n(Deton™Cho-Stantec, 2013).', ' 59CHAPTER 3: NORTHERN TERRITORIES\n 59For land-based corridors, more accurate mapping of geographic sensitivities (e.g., slope stability) \nand hazards would support more appropriate infrastructure.\n5 As surface transportation becomes \n\n\ntechnologies may also need to be considered for northern Canada. Air ships have been studied \n\nas an alternative to surface transporting for many goods (including food) to northern communities \n\nand resource extraction sites Œ prototypes with 10- and 70-tonne load carrying capacity are being \n\n\n\n(Canadian Shipper, 2013). However, timelines for the uptake of this technology remain uncertain. \n\nFinally, while information on adaptation techniques and practices for roads (both winter and all-\n\nweather) in northern regions is readily available, further risk and adaptation research for other modes \n\nwould be useful.5  See: Blais-Stevens and Behnia (2015)9.0 CONCLUSIONS\n\nresearch has been undertaken to assess opportunities and challenges for transportation in the region. \n\n\n\nexisting research can help governments, communities, and practitioners prepare for future conditions, \n\n\n\nand in future.\nThis chapter has described the vulnerabilities of northern transportation infrastructure and operations \n\n\npotential) to address these issues. Underlying themes include the implications of permafrost \n\ndegradation for transportation infrastructure (including all-weather roads, winter roads, and runways/\n\ntaxiways); challenges to northern shipping resulting from greater sea-ice movement, storm surges and \n\n\n\n\nAs discussed throughout this chapter, numerous practices Œ including adaptive maintenance \npractices, technological investments, and construction techniques Œ have been implemented by \n\nboth the public and private sectors to reduce the impacts of a changing climate on people and \n\nsupply chains. Adaptive maintenance requires constant and consistent information-gathering (such \n\nas ensuring snow removal equipment is in place and monitoring weather conditions). Technological \n\ninvestments can range from relatively simple (e.g., pavement grooving to improve traction on \n\n\n\nconstruction requires identifying the nature of the risk (e.g., thawing permafrost) and choosing the \n\nappropriate technique (i.e. reinforcing embankments with geotextiles). Regardless of the approach, \n\n\n\noperating conditions over both the short and long term, and that it has begun to adapt accordingly.\n', ' 60CHAPTER 3: NORTHERN TERRITORIES\n 60REFERENCESAboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada.

FINDINGS Transportation systems in British Columbia\n have demonstrated vulnerability to extreme weather \nand changes in climate.  Impacts of particular concern include those associated with: \n -Extreme precipitation, such as atmospheric river (Pineapple Express) events, affecting road \nand rail networks, marine transportation lanes, and airport facilities; -\n\ninfrastructure, including Vancouver International Airport, Sandspit Airport on Haida Gwaii, and \n\nthe Port of Vancouver;\n -High winds, affecting marine transportation lanes; and,\n -Visibility issues, affecting airport operations, particularly in the British Columbia interior.\n Land transportation routes within British Columbia often occupy restricted corridors through \n\nmountains and along coastlines. \n\nor snowmelt) and slope failures\n have resulted in infrastructure failures to road and rail systems in \nthe past. Events that have affected one of these modes have typically also affected the other. \n While previous efforts to reduce climate risks to transportation systems were often reactive, and \n\nbased on historical information, there is indication that this is changing\n. Transportation entities \nare now inclined to become involved in broader future focused climate change studies and to \n\n Climate change vulnerability assessments and revised and updated infrastructure design criteria \n\ncan improve planning and adaptation efforts for British Columbia™s transportation infrastructure.\n The provincial government has conducted vulnerability assessments for highway systems and \n\ncontinues to monitor and assess sea level rise.  The British Columbia Ministry of Transportation and \n\n\ninclude climate change implications.    Given the interconnectedness of transportation networks in British Columbia, there is opportunity to \n\nshare research, risk analysis, and adaptation best practices across modes. \n1.0 INTRODUCTIONBritish Columbia is Canada™s third-largest and most westerly province, encompassing more than 95 \n\nmillion hectares of land and freshwater (10% of Canada™s land surface) and 27,200 km of coastline \n\n(KnowBC, 2016). Its geography is rugged Œ vast, snow-covered mountain ranges stretch along the \n\ncoast and through eastern and southern regions of the province, while the central interior and \n\nnortheast are characterized by valleys and broad plains. Provincial transportation systems must \n\ncontend with many shoreline inlets, tight corridors traversing mountain ranges with few major passes, \n\nand long distances between population centres. Economic activity and opportunity is distributed \n\nacross the province, as are populations and transportation networks.\n\nNorth America and Asia and facilitates the movement of people and goods to support provincial, \n\nnational, and international trade. In this context, British Columbia requires aviation, marine, road, \n\n\n\ndesigned to withstand certain types of weather and climate conditions, building and maintaining a \n\nviable transportation system in the context of projected changes in climate Œ including temperature, \n\nprecipitation, patterns of extreme weather, and other variables Œ is essential. Transportation systems \n', ' 69CHAPTER 4: BRITISH COLUMBIA 69in the province demonstrate vulnerability to both extreme weather events and incremental changes \n\n\nvulnerabilities and communicating them to decision-makers, progress is evident in advancing climate \n\nadaptation broadly. \nThis chapter examines the interactions and vulnerabilities of transportation infrastructure and operations \nto changes in weather and climate in British Columbia. It has a strong focus on engineering approaches \n\nto climate adaptation in the transportation sector.  The science and practice of adaptation is a relatively \n\n\n\nchallenge and new way of thinking for engineering professionals (see Box). \nADAPTING ENGINEERING PRACTICES TO CLIMATE CHANGE \nWhile engineers have long considered climate related parameters in engineering design work, this has usually \nmeant looking back at historic trends. Given the current rate of climate change, this is no longer a reliable \n\napproach.  Provincial Professional Engineering Associations are responding by adding new professional \n\nrequirements to ensure that potential climate change impacts are taken into account in the design process \n\nfor the service life expected of the infrastructure.  This is a cultural change for agencies responsible for \n\ninfrastructure, consultants carrying out engineering design work and clients commissioning the work. It is \n\n\n\naction and progress. \n\ndesigners, many questions cannot yet be answered. For example, a particular climate parameter like extreme \n\n\n\nAnticipating how this parameter may behave 75 years from now is a level of uncertainty most engineering \n\ndesigners have not had to deal with before. \nIt will take time for engineers to develop procedures and processes to adequately deal with climate change, \nand maximize the likelihood that infrastructure being constructed today remains safe and effective for public \nuse for the whole of its design life.1.1 POPULATION\nAs of October 2014, British Columbia had a population of 4.7 million (Government of British Columbia, \n2015a). The population is growing and becoming more urban, with the greatest growth in Greater \n\nVancouver (Government of British Columbia, 2015b). In 1981, 22% of British Columbia™s population \n\nresided in rural areas and by 2011 this had declined to 14% (Statistics Canada, 2011). While the total \n\nnumber of rural residents remained relatively constant over that period, at around 600,000, urban \n\npopulation grew from 2.1 million to 3.8 million.\nMost of the province™s population is concentrated in southern coastal areas (Figure 1). The Capital City \nof Victoria on southern Vancouver Island has a population of 327,000, while Greater Vancouver on the \n\nsouthern mainland of the province has a population of 2.4 million and comprises almost 60% of the \n\nprovince™s population (Government of British Columbia, 2015b).  \n', ' 70CHAPTER 4: BRITISH COLUMBIA 70Figure 1: 2006 British Columbia Population Densities. \nThe large population centres are located on the south \ncoast, while mountainous and northern areas are very sparsely populated.\n (Source: Statistics Canada)\n1.2 ECONOMY \nIn 2013, British Columbia had a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of $215 billion, which represents about \n13% of Canada™s GDP (Statistics Canada, 2011). Historically, British Columbia™s economic activity \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntourism, education, and manufacturing.British Columbia™s economy depends heavily on trade, including international and interprovincial imports \n\n\ngrowth of China as a global manufacturing centre, demand for British Columbia™s natural resources has \n\n\nIncreased demand from China and India have challenged British Columbia™s transportation \ninfrastructure to meet these emerging opportunities. This infrastructure has played a key role in \n\ninternational trade due to its strategic location. For example, Prince Rupert, Canada™s closest port to \n\n\n\nLong Beach in Los Angeles (Port of Prince Rupert, 2014).  \nTable 1: International and interprovincial trade in British Columbia in 2013. \n(Source: Statistics \nCanada, 2015a)Trade Element\nValue\nPercentage of Provincial \nGDP ExportsInternational\n$49.2 billion23%Interprovincial\n$35.7 billion17%ImportsInternational\n$57.8 billion27%Interprovincial\n$41.8 billion19%', ' 71CHAPTER 4: BRITISH COLUMBIA 711.3 GEOGRAPHY\n (Figure 2). Ground transportation routes generally follow river routes and mountain passes, rather \n than the straight-line alignments typical of many other areas of Canada.   Thus, routes can be \n\n\nsystem (Figure 3). Ecoprovinces are areas with consistent climate processes, oceanography, relief \n\nand regional landforms. Each has a unique climate and they exhibit different sensitivities to projected \n\nclimate changes.  The ecoprovinces generally align with the physiographic features of the province, \n\nas do the major transportation corridors.  With this understanding, it is possible to evaluate how \n\nclimate change trends in British Columbia may affect transportation systems based on generalized \n\nclimate change projections for relevant ecoprovinces within the province.\nFigure 2: Physiological features of British \nColumbia.

An important aspect of British Columbia™s climate is a phenomenon known as \n\n\n\nimpacts on transportation systems. Atmospheric rivers are long narrow streams of high water vapour \n\nconcentrations in the atmosphere that move moisture from tropical regions towards the poles across \n\nthe mid latitudes.  Pineapple Express is a term used to characterize an atmospheric river with origins \n\n\n\nbetween British Columbia and California (Figure 4). Atmospheric rivers are typically several hundred \n\nkilometers wide and thousands of kilometers long, and contain between 3 cm and 6 cm of water \n\n\nAtmospheric rivers occur most frequently in the fall and winter in British Columbia. Their impacts are \ngreatest on coastal areas when the moist water vapor laden air rises over the Coast Mountains, resulting \n\n\n\nevent shown in Figure 4 lasted two days and cost nearly $16 million, while another two-day event in \n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Atmospheric River striking British Columbia on January 8, 2009. \nThe colours in the image below represent ﬁwater vapourﬂ in the middle to upper layers of the atmosphere.

These \n\ntrends have accelerated since the 1950s. Overall, temperature across the province has increased \n\nby 0.18 °C per decade since 1951, an overall increase of 1°C.

One of the dominant factors affecting relative sea-level change in British \n\nColumbia is vertical land motion, which can be attributed to a combination of tectonic activity \n\n\n\nisostatic adjustment (the ongoing movement of land that was once covered by glaciers from the \n\nlast ice age), and changes in ice-mass in the Coast Mountains and Gulf of Alaska (Vadeboncoeur, \n\n\n\nglaciers on nearby ocean waters and ocean surface topography alterations due to changes to \n\nocean currents (Vadeboncoeur, 2016).\n\n\n\nwhich typically occur as storm surges are superimposed on high tides, can be particularly destructive \n\nto coastal infrastructure. \n', ' 74CHAPTER 4: BRITISH COLUMBIA 742.2 PROJECTED CHANGES \nThe Plan2Adapt tool (Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium, 2013c), developed by the Pacific \nClimate Impacts Consortium, provides generalized climate change projections for British \n\nColumbia for three time horizons as well as for each of the ecoprovince designations based on \n\na standard set of climate model projections (Tables 3 and 4).  Projections are broadly consistent \n\nwith observed climate trends (see Section 2.1).

(Source: Natural Resources Canada)\n3.0 OVERVIEW OF BRITISH COLUMBIA™S TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM\nThe British Columbia transportation system encompasses a variety of different modes, including roads \nand highways, rail, marine, air, and urban transit systems.  The diverse hubs and networks related \n\nto these various modes act together to provide a cohesive transportation system that supports \n\nthe people and economy of the Province of British Columbia, as illustrated in Figures 6 and 7. The \n\nalignment of the major transportation corridors and hubs along coastlines and within mountain passes \n\nand corridors is evident. \nThis chapter focuses on roads, rail, marine and air, with urban transit systems discussed in Chapter 9.  \nWhile this chapter discusses each transportation mode individually, it is important to understand that \n\nthey are heavily integrated. Weather impacts that adversely affect one mode of transportation can \n\nalso have negative impacts on other modes.3.1 ROADSBritish Columbia has over 46,000 km of roads, including provincial highways (12,700 km) and side roads \n\n(33, 300 km) (British Columbia Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure, 2014e; Figure 7), in addition \n\nto other municipal and federal roads. There are also over 2,800 bridges within the road system (British \n\nColumbia Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure, 2014e).\n', ' 77CHAPTER 4: BRITISH COLUMBIA 77Figure 6: Principle transportation infrastructure in British Columbia, including permafrost zones.\nFigure 7: Road infrastructure in British Columbia. \n', ' 78CHAPTER 4: BRITISH COLUMBIA 78In 2013, there were three million registered on-road vehicles in British Columbia, representing 13 \npercent of the Canadian total on-road vehicle registrations that year. This includes 2.7 million light-\n\nduty vehicles (automobiles, SUVs and lighter trucks), or approximately one vehicle for every 1.7 \n\npeople in the province (Statistics Canada, 2015b). The province™s population is, therefore, highly \n\ndependent upon the road system. Climate-induced interruptions in road service can have a \n\n3.2 RAILBritish Columbia has approximately 6,500 kilometers of railway (Figure 6), primarily served by Canadian \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nterminal networks in Vancouver and Prince Rupert.  \nCN™s main rail routes in British Columbia run from Vancouver to Edmonton, Alberta from Fort Nelson to \nVancouver, and from Prince Rupert to Edmonton. CN Rail employs three Intermodal terminals in the \n\nprovince, located in Vancouver, Prince George, and Prince Rupert (CN, 2015). CN also operates an \n\nintermodal service from Prince Rupert, British Columbia to Whittier, Alaska. Called the AquaTrain, rail \n\ncars are loaded onto a barge directly and transported.  Alaska is completely dependent on CN Rail \n\nAquaTrain service for its freight transport, as this service is connected to all Alaskan Freight train routes \n\n(Alaskarails, 2015). CP™s main rail route runs from Vancouver to an Intermodal Terminal in Calgary, \n\nAlberta, and the company has one intermodal terminal in Vancouver (CP, 2015).  \nIn 2013, the British Columbia rail system moved 63 million tonnes of commodities, representing over \n20 percent of the Canadian total (Statistics Canada, 2015c). Of these, the principal commodities, by \n\ntonnage, were coal, lumber and wood products, sulphur, cement, automobiles, and wheat.  Many \n\n\n\nIn addition to freight services, VIA Rail offers passenger services along two corridors, from Toronto, \nOntario to Vancouver (The Canadian) (Via Rail, 2015a)\n and from Jasper, Alberta to Prince Rupert, \nBritish Columbia (Western Canada) (Via Rail, 2015b). \n3.3 AIR\n\nto 251 registered land-based airports, aerodromes, heliports and water aerodromes (Transport \n\n\n\nsecond busiest airport in Canada, Victoria the tenth busiest and Kelowna the eleventh busiest (Travel \n\nBC, 2016).

Vancouver International Airport (YVR) handles over 19 \n\nmillion passengers and more than 256, 900 tonnes of cargo in 2014 (Vancouver Port Authority, 2014). \n\nAirport expansion plans are expected to increase capacity.\n', ' 79CHAPTER 4: BRITISH COLUMBIA 793.4 MARINE \nBritish Columbia has three international ports, four regional ports, and 40 local ports (see Figure 6 for \nprinciple ports).  Port Metro Vancouver is Canada™s largest and busiest marine port, representing trade \n\nin excess of $187 billion annually with more than 160 countries (Port Metro Vancouver, 2014), and \n\nadding approximately $10.5 billion to the national economy (Government of British Columbia, 2011a). \n\nThe three container ports in Vancouver, Prince Rupert and Nanaimo are interconnected with rail \n\nand road systems, as are major ports at Kitimat and Squamish. The ports of Stewart, Port Alberi, and \n\n\n\nCorridor with capacity of 750,000 TEUs Œ container shipments are measured in 20-foot equivalent units, \n\nor TEUs, which represent one standard-sized shipping container (Government of British Columbia, \n\n\n\n\nIn 2010, the province™s marine ports handled:\n \n \n.Principal exports, by tonnage were coal, forest products, grain, potash, petroleum products, and \nmetals, minerals, and chemicals.  Principal imports included: automobiles, household goods, \n\nconstruction materials, machinery, produce, base metals, and beverages. British Columbia™s marine \n\n\n\nhandled 812,000 cruise ship passengers (Port Metro Vancouver, 2015b).\nFerries are another key element of the province™s marine transportation system.  7.7 million vehicles \nwere transported by ferry through the province™s ferry system in 2014, representing 19.8 million \n\npassengers on 171,000 sailings (British Columbia Ferry Services Inc., 2015). BC Ferries, formerly a \n\ncrown corporation and now a commercial organization, has 35 vessels and 47 ports of call providing \n\npassenger and cargo services to coastal locations in British Columbia. Ferry connections to the United \n\nStates from British Columbia include the Alaska Marine Highway System, providing transport between \n\nPrince Rupert and South East Alaska.  In the South, vessels between British Columbia and Washington \n\nState provide service to coastal and island locations. Inland Ferries transport passengers and cargo \n\nacross rivers and lakes on the mainland. Other vessels such as water taxis also provide transport to \n\nvarious locations.The next section discusses historic climate impacts, future climate risks and adaptation practices as \nthey relate to road, rail, air and marine transport in British Columbia.  Discussion of historic impacts \n\n', ' 80CHAPTER 4: BRITISH COLUMBIA 804.0 ROAD SYSTEMS4.1 HISTORIC CLIMATE IMPACTS\nBritish Columbia highways have exhibited clear vulnerability to extreme rain events that have caused \n\n\n\n\nto road washouts.  Debris can also accumulate at bridge structures, potentially leading to bridge \n\nfailures.  In some instances, these events can isolate communities from their principle lines of supply.\nThree events, which all resulted in washouts of road infrastructure systems, are highlighted here to \nillustrate the climate sensitivities of British Columbia™s highway infrastructure.  The locations of these \n\nevents have subsequently been the focus of detailed vulnerability assessments by the British Columbia \n\nMinistry of Transportation and Infrastructure (see Section 4.2).\nBELLA COOLA - SEPTEMBER 2010 \nOn September 25th and 26th, 2010 an intense frontal system stalled over the Central British Columbia \ncoast, bringing heavy rainfall exceeding the 1-in-200 year rainfall of 200 mm (TranBC, 2016).

The rail industry in British \n\nColumbia has a long history of managing the effects of weather conditions on its operations. A review \n\nof Transportation Safety Board of Canada (TSB) reports reveals an ongoing and evolving pattern of rail \n\nincidents associated with climate events, in particular high precipitation events in British Columbia™s \n\ntransportation corridors.  The British Columbia rail system has experienced incidents related to extreme \n\nprecipitation, spring runoff and drainage.  These events can undermine railroad beds and are \n\n\nThree weather-related incidents, associated with varying degrees of infrastructure damage, \nenvironmental impacts and injuries to railroad personnel, are highlighted here and could be used \n\nas a foundation to evaluate the potential for climate change to exacerbate conditions that have \n\nhistorically led to interruptions in rail services.

The rail gauge canted \n\noutward as a result of ice build-up between the \n\nbase of the rail and the tie plates (Figure 15).

In several of the case studies considered previously, failures \n\non road system components resulted in mudslides onto the rail system. Therefore, severe weather \n\nevents that negatively affect one system may have simultaneous impacts on others.  \nClimate change work by British Columbia™s Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure indicates \nthat in these same corridors, highways will continue to be affected by intense precipitation events \n\nleading to drainage component failure and slope instability, and that these events are anticipated \n\nto increase both in frequency and intensity into the future.  Given the close proximity between road \n\nand rail in British Columbia and the history of sequential and coincident failure of these systems, it is \n\nreasonable to project similar patterns of vulnerability for the rail system.\n5.3 ADAPTATION PRACTICES\n\n\n\n\nBritish Columbia are making considerable effort to address the impacts of severe climate events, \n\nincluding extreme precipitation. The recommendations that arise from these investigations and \n\nfollow up activities are very similar to those that may arise from focussed climate change assessment \n\nanalyses. The forensic analysis conducted as part of the TSB investigation process is a critical input to \n\nclimate change adaptation assessment, such as the work conducted by the British Columbia Ministry \n\nof Transportation Infrastructure for the province™s highway system.

Actions cover a range of research, monitoring, procedural, maintenance, reporting \n\nand engineering activities. From this, we can conclude that rail companies in British Columbia are \n\nconducting activities to reduce climate risks (see Box). The TSB and rail companies extrapolate from \n\nforensic analyses of climate related failure events to establish generalized actions and approaches to \n\nmitigate the risk of such events throughout the rail system in general. \n', ' 92CHAPTER 4: BRITISH COLUMBIA 92RAIL INDUSTRY APPROACH TO CLIMATE CHANGE (MICHAEL GULLO, RAILWAY ASSOCIATION OF \nCANADA, PERSONAL COMMUNICATION, 2015)\nRailway capital investments address a variety of issues and challenges, including how extreme \n\n, can lead to service \n\n\n\n\ntest natural hazard warning systems, undertake regular rail inspections, and ensure processes \n\nare in place to mitigate against, and to recover from, severe weather situations. A variety of \n\ntechnologies are applied to determine the status of rail infrastructure and the landscape it \n\ntraverses, including: Radar interferometer to measure track stability,\n Vulnerability assessment of risk area and GIS mapping,\n Landslide mapping; temporal and spatial, Geotechnical assessment of slopes, Laser movement detection system, Fiber optic detection for slope movement, River hydraulic studies; and, Beaver dam assessment and management.For planning and operations, the rail sector generally uses short-term weather forecasts/\nconsiderations, rather than long-term climate projections. \n Rail companies are concerned about \nclimate change in terms of the potential for more frequent and/or intense severe weather \n\nphenomena, as these may cause catastrophic risk to the railway network and its operations. \n\nThe Railway Association of Canada and the American Association of Railroads have both \n\nestablished Environment Committees that include extreme and inclement weather events within \n\ntheir mandates.\nto help them identify where climate change impacts are expected to occur in the short, \nmedium and long term.\n  With this knowledge, adaptation efforts within the sector can be \ntargeted, and ultimately more strategic. \n', ' 93CHAPTER 4: BRITISH COLUMBIA 936.0 AIR TRANSPORT\n6.1 HISTORICAL CLIMATE IMPACTS\nClimate affects air transportation systems in many ways, including: 1) accidents where weather \nconditions have contributed to the causes; 2) service interruptions that have been caused by \n\nweather; and, 3) impacts on physical infrastructure systems.\nWEATHER-RELATED ACCIDENTS\nThe air industry has a long history of managing and coping with weather conditions and has \n\nestablished standard procedures for accessing weather forecast information and incorporating that \n\n\n\n\n\ntechnology that incorporate advanced aircraft instrumentation systems.

Furthermore, \n\nthe relative scarcity of weather-related aircraft incidents indicates that the air sector has effective, \n\nongoing management strategies and technological development to accommodate severe weather \n\n\n', ' 94CHAPTER 4: BRITISH COLUMBIA 94WEATHER-RELATED SERVICE DISRUPTIONS\nWeather-related delays and cancellations in air transportation services can be very disruptive to \nindividuals and the Canadian economy, as they can have ripple effects across the national airport \n\nsystem. Causes include thunderstorms, fog, snow, and icing.  In mountainous regions of the British \nColumbia interior weather-related fog and visibility issues can be problematic.\n  Varying topography \ncan result in very different weather conditions in close proximity.\n  For example, the West Kootenay \n\n\nsurrounding mountains while the Trail Regional Airport, roughly 40 km south of Castlegar, offers better \n\n\n  Navigation technologies can play \nan important role in reducing weather-related delays. For example, the Northwest Regional Airport \n\nin Terrace, in the Coastal Mountains, often experiences weather conditions very similar to the West \n\nKootenay Regional Airport, but has far fewer weather related cancellations. This can be attributed \n\nto Instrument Landing Systems (ILS) employed at the Terrace Airport that are not installed at West \n\nKootenay. These systems can cost well in excess of $1 million to install, and are often considered \n\nuneconomic for smaller airports. \n\ncancellations, include extreme weather, storm surge and sea level rise over time. Fortunately airports \n\nin British Columbia can handle most snowstorm events, with the occasional service delay.  Having \n\nappropriate snow removal equipment and staff can help to manage this type of event.  \nVisibility issues are more problematic. While Vancouver International Airport has an advanced ILS \n(enabling landing and departures in visibility conditions as low as 600 feet), not every airport in \n\nBritish Columbia is equipped with ILS. While other management options such as Required Navigation \n\nPerformance may be available, they often require ongoing cooperation between regional airports \n\n\n\nairports.  This can inconvenience passengers, and over the long-term, potentially compromising \n\nregional growth. \nIMPACTS ON PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS\nCoastal airports may be exposed to the hazards of storm surge and sea level rise (see Box). For \n\nexample, the low elevation of Vancouver International Airport™s physical infrastructure could \n\npotentially be affected by storm surge and sea level rises over time.  This \nairport is a major regional, \nnational, and international hub, and disruption of service could have wide-ranging impacts on \n\nair mode reliability in British Columbia and elsewhere.  The airport is located on Sea Island, close \n\nto\n\n\n\nsea level rise.  A dyke system, approximately 15 km long, currently protects Sea Island.  The Airport \n\n\n\n\n\nelevations (Marion Town, Vancouver Airport Authority, personal communication, 2015). Other relevant \n\nmeasures at Vancouver Airport include ensuring the airport has an in-to-wind runway in virtually all \n\nwind conditions; and investments in pavement snow and ice control and de-icing, to ensure aircraft \n\ncan safety operate in severe weather conditions.\n', ' 95CHAPTER 4: BRITISH COLUMBIA 956.2 FUTURE CLIMATE RISKS\nWhile visibility is an ongoing concern for British Columbia airports, it is presently unclear how climate \nchange will affect the situation. The vulnerability assessments of highways by the British Columbia \n\nMinistry of Transportation and Infrastructure noted that current climate models cannot project \n\nchanges in visibility conditions in the complex landscape of the British Columbia Interior Mountains. \n\n\n\n\nWarmer and wetter winters in future might suggest a decline in snow-related air travel delays: \nhowever, projections of changes in the frequency and intensity of snowfall events over a shorter \nwinter season remain uncertain. This represents another area where additional modeling work to \n\nassess the nature, form, frequency and intensity of future snowfall events for major British Columbia \n\nairports would be valuable.\n\n\nAirport).  As part of the Vancouver International Airport Authority™s work to support the Airport \n\nMaster Plan 2057, the Airport Authority is assessing climate change impacts on airport operations. \n\nThe objective of this work will be to review and gain a better understanding of anticipated climate \nSANDSPIT AIRPORT\nTransportation infrastructure and operations \nat Sandspit Airport, Haida Gwaii, are \n\nsusceptible to winter storms and associated \n\nstorm surges with potential increases and \nattendant issues as sea levels rise over time.  The runway is located across the ‚spit™ and \n\nheavy and frequent winter storms have \n\ncaused severe wave damage to riprap \n\nrevetment, which is a sloping structure made \n\nof rocks or other material, protecting the \n\nshore. Overtopping of the revetment has \n\nbecome more frequent in recent years, with \n\ndamage and repairs occurring on an annual \n\nbasis, including marine debris and driftwood \n\n\n\nand pavement (Figure 16). The airport is also \n\n\n\nfor migratory birds. Airport operators have \n\nobserved changes over the last decade in \n\nmigratory and resident birds that also affect \n\nmanagement of the airport.  \nIn light of these changes, the airport needs \nto continuously adapt its operations to \n\nensure continued safety. The vulnerability of \n\nSandspit Airport may need to be further assessed, along with new management approaches \n\nand practices, as the frequency and magnitude of storm surge events will increase as a result of \n\nsea level rise.\nFigure 16: Sandspit runway from December \n2011. The end of the runway was subject to \nsevere wave overtopping during a \n\n\n\napproximately 1 metre above runway \nelevation.  A 250 m section of damaged \nriprap needed to be re-constructed. \n', ' 96CHAPTER 4: BRITISH COLUMBIA 96\n\n\nresults of these studies will culminate in adaptation plans from which any infrastructure improvements \n\nwould be incorporated and funded through the Airport Authority™s capital program.\n6.3 ADAPTATION PRACTICES\nThe air sector manages weather conditions on an ongoing basis, adjusting practices as changes in \n\nweather phenomena are observed.  In this sense, for many airports (with exceptions, such as Vancouver \n\nInternational Airport), adaptation tends to be primarily reactive, rather than performed in anticipation of \n\nfuture changes.  At the same time, aircraft technology is evolving with more frequent use of instrument \n\n\nWhile there is very little information available regarding climate change risk assessment studies for air \ntransportation in British Columbia, this does not mean that these studies are not being undertaken, \n\nas they may not be published or available in the public domain. For example, there has been a \n\ncommitment to undertake a climate change risk assessment for the Vancouver International Airport that \n\naddresses risks of sea level rise and implications for the ongoing review and renewal of dike systems. \n7.0 MARINE TRANSPORT\nAs a coastal province, and a major national hub for both passengers and goods, weather events that \n\n\n\nimpacts.  As with aviation, impacts of concern include:\n Accidents where weather conditions have contributed to the causes; \n Service interruptions caused by weather; and, \n Impacts on physical infrastructure systems.\n7.1 HISTORICAL CLIMATE IMPACTS\nThe marine sector has a long history of managing and coping with weather conditions and has \nestablished standard procedures for accessing weather forecast information and incorporating that \n\ninformation into voyage planning.  As a result, impacts of severe weather are normally managed \n\nthrough avoidance practices (resulting in delays) and through improvements in technology that \n\nincorporate advanced weather monitoring and navigation systems.  For example, Environment and \n\nClimate Change Canada maintains an extensive network of weather forecasting areas, observation \n\nsites and marine weather radio frequencies for the British Columbia coastline (Government of Canada, \n\n2016). The system provides ongoing weather information to the marine sector and provides warnings of \n\ninclement weather that may affect marine transportation systems. This has resulted in weather-related \n\nmarine accidents being relatively uncommon in British Columbia. A limited review of TSB reports suggests \n\nthat any weather-related marine incidents involve strong components of human error.  \nSeaports in British Columbia must be able to handle high winds and heavy rainfall, normally at the \nsame time.  In 2014, four percent of British Columbia ferry sailings were delayed due to weather.  High \n\nwinds are a common cause of delays, with heavy rain another factor (British Columbia Ferry Services \n\nInc., 2016).  While the percentage is not large, it nonetheless represents 6,600 of the year™s sailings \n\nbeing disrupted by weather conditions. Severe weather can not only result in delayed or canceled \n\nsailings, but can also affect physical infrastructure systems. For example, on November 3, 2015, high \n\nwinds pushed the Queen of Nanaimo (ferry service between Vancouver Island and the Mainland) \nout \n', ' 97CHAPTER 4: BRITISH COLUMBIA 97of position, causing it to crash into and damage a. However, \nto date damage to physical infrastructure systems arising from weather related events has been \nrelatively rare.\n7.2 FUTURE CLIMATE RISKS\nWhile wind is a key parameter in climate change forecast work, predicting the nature and intensity \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExisting practices that utilize a sophisticated network of weather monitoring and forecasting facilities \n\n\n\ncancellations and delays, with economic implications. This is an area for further study.\nPreliminary analysis (see Section 2.2) indicates a likely increase in the frequency of atmospheric river \nevents by 2041-2070, with the largest increases on the coast.  The average number of atmospheric \n\nriver days per year is projected to approximately double at most locations, including the interior. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nare located.  These studies are being developed under a Lower Mainland Flood Management \n\nStrategy that involves a number of entities including municipal and provincial governments, the \n\nFraser Basin Council and others such as Port Metro Vancouver (Kerr Wood Leidal, 2015). As part of this \n\nStrategy, the Fraser Basin Council is proposing to examine the vulnerability of key infrastructure, such \n\nas ports, rail, airports, highways, emergency or major road networks, and BC Hydro substations, to \n\n\nclimate change on the Fraser River (Fraser Basin Council, 2014), and also published guidelines for \n\n\n\nthe British Columbia Professional Engineers and Geoscientists have published professional practice \n\n\n\nGeoscientists of British Columbia, 2012). The Ministry of Forests, Lands and Natural Resource Operations \n\n\n\ncoastline for the year 2100 (Government of British Columbia, 2016b). The maps clearly indicate that \n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.3 ADAPTATION PRACTICES\nThe extensive network of weather monitoring stations and forecasting services for the marine sector \n\nin British Columbia represents a primary response to reducing climate risks.  The sector adjusts \n\n\n\nto accommodate weather changes. The longer term risks to coastal infrastructure including ports, \nassociated with sea-level rise are recognized by the provincial government. It has implemented a \n\n\n\nupgrading sea dykes.', ' 98CHAPTER 4: BRITISH COLUMBIA 988.0 PROVINCIAL CLIMATE ADAPTATION PRACTICES\nThe Government of British Columbia has been working to better prepare the province to adapt \nto a changing climate. This includes a province-wide plan \n\nColumbia™s Adaptation Strategy, which aims to build a foundation of knowledge and tools, make \n\nadaptation a part of the Government™s decision-making, and assess risks and implement priority \n\nadaptation actions in key climate sensitive sectors (British Columbia Ministry of Environment, 2010). \n\nhas developed a set of notional best practices based on the outcomes from their climate \n\nchange vulnerability assessments of British Columbia highway systems (British Columbia Ministry of \n\nTransportation and Infrastructure, 2014e). These notional best practices are generally applicable to all \n\ntransportation infrastructure systems, and are grouped into three primary categories: data, personnel; \n\nand, process (see\n Box).BRITISH COLUMBIA MINISTRY OF TRANSPORTATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE - CLIMATE ADAPTATION \n\nPRACTICESThe notional best practices developed by the British Columbia Ministry of Transportation and \n\n\ndocument, please visit: http://www.th.gov.bc.ca/climate_action/documents/MoTI-Climate%20\nAdaptation_Best%20Practices.pdf Data Keep weather and climate data up to date Establish monitoring programs\n Always consider the impact of extreme precipitation events\n Consider combinations and sequences of events Identify sources for robust climate change information\n Ensure that projections are based on ensembles of climate model outputs\nPersonnel Strive for balance between computational methods and professional judgement\n Identify, monitor and manage climate change issues Establish multidisciplinary climate change review teams\n \nProcess\n Provide vulnerability assessment tools and appropriate training\n Use risk management to address uncertainties\n Incorporate climate change adaptation measures into planning cycles\n Mandate consideration of climate change in ongoing activities', ' 99CHAPTER 4: BRITISH COLUMBIA 999.0 INFORMATION AND KNOWLEDGE GAPS THAT CONSTRAIN DECISION-MAKING\n\nadaptation decision-making related to transportation systems in British Columbia. \n Extreme Precipitation Events.\n Extreme precipitation events are the primary climate-related \nconcern for road and rail transportation systems in British Columbia.  Work is ongoing to \n\ncharacterize the future nature, frequency and intensity of such events. This work could be \n\n\n\nto inform system design, operation and maintenance for future extreme weather and climate \n\nconditions.  Additionally, further work to characterize conditions that affect marine transportation \n\nand to project future precipitation event frequency and intensity would be useful.\n Sea Level Rise Impacts on Coastal Infrastructure Systems.\n  Sea level rise and storm surge pose \nrisks to coastal infrastructure in British Columbia, particularly to Vancouver International Airport, \n\nSandspit Airport and Port Metro Vancouver.  The Province of British Columbia has an active \n\nprogram to assess these risks and provide guidance to decision makers regarding adapting to sea \n\nlevel rise. Risk assessments will continue to be a key tool in ensuring that the owners and operators \n\nof critical coastal infrastructure facilities in British Columbia have the appropriate information to \n\nbuild, adjust and maintain infrastructure that is adaptable to sea level rise. \n Marine Wind Events.\n High winds can lead to sailing cancellations and delays within the marine \ntransportation system.  Climate change projections of high wind event frequency and intensity \n\nare not reliable.  More work in this area would provide decision makers with a better foundation to \n\nplan and implement operational changes to adapt to changes in high wind event frequency and \n\nintensity. Visibility Issues in the Interior.\n\nin the British Columbia interior. While these issues are being managed, the causes of low visibility \n\n(fog) in the interior, and particularly the likely future changes in conditions that lead to these \n\nevents, are not well understood.  More knowledge about these weather effects could aid decision \n\nmakers in implementing new systems and procedures to adapt to anticipated changes.\nClimate change adaptation in all transportation marine modes in British Columbia has generally \n\nbeen reactive, with issues being addressed only after impacts have been observed.  However, recent \n\nvulnerability assessments have examined longer-term climate change issues for some infrastructure.  \n\nThese studies of climate change and its effects on infrastructure will allow operators to better \n\nanticipate issues, and encourage the development of contingencies to adapt facilities, assets and \n\noperations to the risks posed by a changing climate.  Given the contribution of rail, air and marine \n\nsectors to the provincial and national economies, additional climate change vulnerability assessments \n\n', ' 100CHAPTER 4: BRITISH COLUMBIA 10010.0 CONCLUSIONThis chapter has demonstrated the vulnerability of British Columbia™s transportation system to extreme \n\n\nareas for additional work.  The province™s transportation network is critical for the effective movement \n\nof people and goods through airports, ports, rail, and roads Œ both within the province and between \n\nNorth America and Asia. However, many of British Columbia™s transportation corridors, which traverse \n\nmountainous terrain and coastlines, are vulnerable to disruption and even failure resulting from \n\nclimate events. \nThis chapter also indicates that infrastructure operators in British Columbia are primarily responding \nto failures, rather than anticipating and preparing for change. As a result, infrastructure impacts \n\ncould be more severe than if proactive adaptive measures had been taken.  Along with more \n\nrobust data collection tools for climate and weather variables, and effective guidelines for data \n\nmodeling and interpretation, proactive approaches (i.e. vulnerability assessments, infrastructure \n\ndesign requirements) could offer transportation decision-makers a stronger foundation for adaptive \n\ndecisions. Sharing studies of climate vulnerability among operators and modes may improve learning \n\nThe British Columbia Ministry of Transportation has assessed the vulnerability of several of the \n\n\ninfrastructure design work for the ministry consider climate change implications.  This is an important \n\nindicator that adaptation efforts in British Columbia™s transportation sector are advancing, though \nmore work remains to be done. \n', ' 101CHAPTER 4: BRITISH COLUMBIA 101REFERENCESAlaskarails.

FINDINGS: Flooding associated with extreme precipitation events has been driving climate adaptation efforts \nfor transportation in the Prairies, and increasing frequency and intensity of such events is a key \nfuture concern.\n  Flood-control strategies (e.g., expanded and enhanced culvert programs to \nreduce washouts, impermeable runway treatments) represent key adaptations for rail operations, \n\nairports (particularly in the northern Prairies), and roadways in the region to date.\n The high variability inherent in the climate of the Prairies means that adaptation in the \n\ntransportation sector is likely to involve both reactive and proactive measures.  \nGiven climate \nuncertainties and cost challenges in the transportation sector, decision-makers in the Prairies tend \n\nto view operational adaptations on a case-by-case basis. The importance of long-term planning \n\nfor infrastructure (including zoning requirements), however, is illustrated by damage sustained in \n\n\n Efforts are underway to address the vulnerability of winter roads to increasing temperatures in the \n\nPrairies.  While routing changes and technical adaptations have contributed to longer operating \n\nthe construction of all-weather roads).\n Thawing of permafrost in the Hudson Bay Lowlands will continue to challenge the operational \nviability of rail in the region.\n Since the track was laid in the 1930s, geotechnical engineers have \nmade costly efforts to stabilize the rail bed.\n   Over the long term, thawing permafrost is likely \nto increase stabilization challenges, although disappearing permafrost could also improve the \n\nviability of some techniques. \n1.0 INTRODUCTION \nA changing climate and extreme weather present both challenges and opportunities for Canada™s \n\nPrairies, including the region™s extensive transportation infrastructure and operations. One objective \n\nof this chapter is to identify what is known about the nature of climate impacts (both positive \n\nand negative) occurring now and in the future in Canada™s three Prairie provinces Œ Manitoba, \n\nSaskatchewan, and Alberta. The chapter also aims to identify and describe efforts made by \n\ngovernments and transportation operators to adapt practices and improve infrastructure to enhance \n\nthe resilience of the region™s transportation network.\nWhile referred to as ﬁthe Prairiesﬂ for simplicity in this chapter, the three provinces are quite distinct. \nThe following section reviews some of the key geographic and economic characteristics of Alberta, \n\n\n\nthroughout the chapter. Subsequent sections focus on climate impacts and associated adaptation \n\npractices for each major mode of transportation Œ roads, rail, aviation, and marine based on \n\navailable information and practitioner experiences.  \n', ' 108CHAPTER 5: THE PRAIRIES 1081.1 GEOGRAPHY AND THE PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENTThe Prairie provinces collectively account for approximately 20 percent of Canada™s total surface \narea, including both land and water (Statistics Canada, 2005). The Prairies extend west from Hudson \n\nBay to the crest of the Rocky Mountains, spanning several major watersheds and geographic areas \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngrasslands and less than half of the wetlands that existed prior to European settlement remain \n\n(Sauchyn and Kulshreshtha, 2008). This region gives way to the Boreal Plains in central Manitoba, \n\ncentral Saskatchewan, and most of central and northern Alberta, an area characterized by mixed \n\nand coniferous forests (Sauchyn and Kulshreshtha, 2008). The Boreal Shield lies north and east of the \n\ninterior plains in northern Saskatchewan and northeastern Manitoba.\nThe four remaining ecozones are on the margins of the Prairies, accounting for small proportions of \nthe region™s area and population. The Taiga Plains extend from the Mackenzie River valley of the \n\nNorthwest Territories up the tributary valleys of northwestern Alberta, containing forests with limited \n\nproductivity due to a cooler climate and shorter growing season (Sauchyn and Kulshreshtha, 2008). \n\nThe Taiga Shield extends across Canada™s subarctic, including the northern reaches of Manitoba and \n\nSaskatchewan and northeastern Alberta. At opposite corners of the Prairies are the Hudson Plains \n\nin the Prairies™ northeast (containing the Hudson Bay Lowlands), which are dominated by extensive \n\nwetlands (Beaudoin et al., 1997), and the Montane Cordillera in southwestern Alberta. The Cordillera \n\n\n\nfescue grassland through montane forest to subalpine forest and alpine tundra (Sauchyn and \n\nKulshreshtha, 2008).

Altitudes \n\ngenerally rise east to west. Churchill, Manitoba, is located at sea level on the shore of Hudson Bay and \n\nrepresents the Prairies™ only access to tidewater. Almost all road and rail infrastructure is concentrated \n\n\nEast of the Rocky Mountains, there are few physical limitations to surface transportation in the Prairies. \nThe mountains constitute an evident barrier, although corridors through the Rockies have existed \n\n\n\nroadways between Alberta and British Columbia (Babaian, 1985). Other major mountain routes \n\ninclude the Yellowhead, Kicking Horse, Howse, Athabasca, and Vermillion Passes.

From 2010 to 2011, the gross \n\ndomestic product (GDP) of the three provinces collectively rose 11.1 percent to $429.5 billion, nearly \n\ndoubling the national growth rate. By 2014, the region™s contribution to Canada™s GDP totaled 25.6 \n\npercent. In 2014, Alberta contributed the largest share to the Prairies™ combined GDP, due primarily \n\nto its extensive oil and gas reserves and large population. In 2013, Alberta contributed 72 percent \n\nof regional GDP, followed by Saskatchewan (14.7 percent), and Manitoba (13 percent) (Statistics \n\nCanada, 2014a).The Prairies™ share of GDP from transportation and warehousing remained stable from 2009 to 2013, \nranging from 4.3 to 4.4 percent (Statistics Canada, 2014a). While the North American Industrial \n\n\n\nmeasure of transportation™s economic contributions, transportation indirectly enables many other \n\nforms of economic activity and growth (Ebert, 2000). \n', ' 110CHAPTER 5: THE PRAIRIES 1102.0 OVERVIEW OF TRANSPORTATION IN THE PRAIRIES\nThe Prairies™ transportation network is extensive, with road, rail, and aviation providing options for \nthe movement of people and freight. While the Prairies™ surface transportation network supports \n\n\n\nthe Prairies. Canada™s only Arctic port is located at Churchill, Manitoba. In 2016, due to reductions \n\nin the volume of grain being moved through the port, the owner of the Port of Churchill, OmniTRAX, \n\nannounced the closure of the port for grain shipments. Currently, the port remains open for resupply \n\nto Nunavut. Figure 2 presents a visual overview of major transportation infrastructure in the Prairies.\nFigure 2: Principle transportation infrastructure in the Prairies, including permafrost zones. \nNote that \n2.1 ROAD TRANSPORTATION\nThe Prairies have a relatively high number of road-km per capita due to an extensive municipal and \n\nprovincial road network, and a lower population density than the national average (3.3 versus 3.7 \n\npersons per km2) (Statistics Canada, 2011). The Prairies account for 47 percent of Canada™s public \nroads, although this drops to 26 percent if only paved roads are considered (Transport Canada, \n\n2015). Saskatchewan accounts for almost half (48 percent) of the region™s total road-km (295,100 km), \n\nAlberta ranks second with 228,600 km (37 percent of Prairie road-km), followed by Manitoba, with \n\n91,700 km (15 percent) (Transport Canada, 2015).

Key road-freight border crossings in the Prairies include Emerson (Manitoba), Coutts \n\n(Alberta), and North Portal (Saskatchewan). These crossings collectively accounted for 12 percent \n\nof Canada™s road trade with the United States in 2014, 9.2 percent of exports, and 14.2 percent of \n\nimports (Transport Canada, 2015).\n2.1.1 WINTER ROADSWinter roads (Figure 3) constitute an important part of the northern Prairies™ road network, providing \n\nseasonal access to remote communities and reducing the tonnage of goods requiring more \n\nexpensive air delivery. Winter roads enable the delivery of food, fuel, medical supplies, and building \n\nmaterials (reducing the costs of these goods); support local economies; and provide access to \n\nhealthcare and other parts of the region. \nManitoba™s winter roads typically operate from mid-January to mid-March, extend approximately \n2,500 km, and serve 28 communities with a total population of 30,000 (Taylor and Perry, 2014). \n\nComparably, winter roads in Alberta and Saskatchewan (with similar operating seasons) are modest: \n\nAlberta operates two routes totaling 447 km, while Saskatchewan™s three winter roads cover 274 km \n\n\n\nconcern that warmer winters associated with changing climate conditions will result in shorter \n\noperational seasons for freight operators; however, as discussed in Section 4.5 and Case study 3, \n\nrecent years have witnessed longer seasons (Sauchyn and Kulshreshtha, 2008).\n', ' 112CHAPTER 5: THE PRAIRIES 1122.2 RAIL TRANSPORTATION\n\nrailways3\nFe - BNSF) carry the vast majority of regional rail freight. Most tracks are located in areas without \n\npermafrost. One exception is the rail line connecting Churchill, Manitoba with supply-chain hubs to \n\nthe south (Figure 2).\nAlthough the operational length of Canada™s rail network has declined in recent years, the Prairies \nhave resisted this trend. As of 2012, the regional network had retained 94 percent of its 2008 length \n\n(Railway Association of Canada, 2015). In 2013: Alberta had 6,679 km, used by CN, CP, Great Sandhills Railway, Alberta Prairie Railway Excursions, \n\nGreat Canadian Railtour Company, and VIA; \n Saskatchewan had 8,181 km, used by CN, CP, Carlton Trail, Great Western, Great Sandhills \n\nRailway, and VIA; and \n Manitoba operated 4,448 km, used by CN, CP, BNSF, Central Manitoba, Hudson Bay, and VIA. \nIn all three provinces, freight comprises approximately 98 percent of track usage (based upon fuel \n\n\n\nfreight originated in Alberta, 27 million tonnes in Saskatchewan, and 10.6 million tonnes in Manitoba \n\n(Railway Association of Canada, 2015).In 2013, three of Canada™s top-ten freight-rail border crossings were located in the Prairies: Warroad, \nMinnesota-Sprague, Manitoba; Portal, North Dakota-North Portal, Saskatchewan; and Pembina, North \n\nDakota-Emerson, Manitoba (Transport Canada, 2014).\n2.3 AVIATION\n\n\nairports in the region (serving Calgary, Edmonton, Saskatoon, Regina, and Winnipeg), which \n\naccounted for 22 percent (28.7 million) of Canada™s total enplaned/deplaned passengers in 2014 \n\n(Transport Canada, 2015). Arrivals/departures at these airports accounted for 78 percent of the \n\nregion™s passenger movements in 2014. \nAir freight is often chosen for higher-value shipments; therefore, air freight tends to account for a \nlarger share of freight by value than by weight compared to other modes. Accounting for all inbound \n\nand outbound shipments in 2014 (both domestic and international), Manitoba moved 65,873 tonnes, \n\nSaskatchewan handled 12,077 tonnes, and Alberta accounted for 113,933 tonnes (Statistics Canada, \n\n2014b). Principal airports in Manitoba are shown in Figure 2. \n2.4 MARINE TRANSPORTATION\nA review of marine transportation in the Prairies is essentially a review of the Port of Churchill in \n\nManitoba (the Prairies™ only access to tidewater). Opened in 1931, the Port is an artery to northern \n\nManitoba and the central Arctic region (Government of Manitoba, 2015a). In 2016, the private owner \n\nof the port, OmniTRAX, announced the closure of the port for grain shipments, due to the limited \n\nvolume of grain moving through the port. Currently the port remains open, supporting resupply to \n\ncommunities located in Nunavut.3 This refers to carriers with operating revenues exceeding $250 million (Railway Association of Canada, 2015).\n', ' 113CHAPTER 5: THE PRAIRIES 113Churchill is capable of handling Panamax-sized vessels with four berths totaling over 900m in length, \nalthough these facilities are modest compared to other Canadian ports. The Port of Churchill \n\noperates within (approximately) a 14-week shipping season, beginning in mid-July and extending to \n\nthe end of October/early November. The shipping season is estimated to lengthen by two to three \n\nweeks over the 21st century in tandem with a shorter sea-ice season in the Hudson Strait (Hochheim \nand Barber, 2014), offering new opportunities for resource and resupply shipping (Lackenbauer and \n\nLajeunesse, 2014). The seasonal duration of sea ice in this area has declined since record-keeping \n\nbegan in the 1970s (Tivy et al., 2007; Hochheim and Barber, 2014).\n3.0 CLIMATE PROFILE\nThe Prairies are generally characterized by extreme differences in seasonal temperatures (an annual \n\n\n\n\n\nof the Rocky Mountains, the climate is generally cold and sub-humid (Sauchyn and Kulshreshtha, \n\n2008). The region™s southern core has a sub-humid climate that becomes semi-arid during periods \n\nof drought (Lemmen et al., 1998). Water balance increases moving west, north, and east from this \n\ncore area. Snow is a critical form of seasonal water storage throughout the region. Chinook winds, \n\n\n\nwinter phenomenon in the foothills and prairies of the southwest. Severe summer storms and lightning \n\nŒ often associated with damaging hail (Kovacs and Thistlethwaite, 2014) and, occasionally, tornadoes \n\n(Environment Canada, 2015a) Œ are key climate risks in the Prairies.\nIn the context of a changing climate, increasing water scarcity represents a risk to the region. Also, \nthe Prairies are likely to lose advantages associated with cold winters, particularly as they relate to \n\nwinter roads (Sauchyn and Kulshreshtha, 2008).\n3.1 PAST TRENDS\nInstrumental climate records on the Prairies extend more than 120 years. Despite high year-to-year \n\nvariability, long-term records demonstrate increasing mean annual temperatures, ranging from \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCanada, 2015b) and is about twice the increase in mean global temperature over the same period \n\n(Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2013). The greatest warming is evident in winter and \n\nspring, with the least occurring in fall (Vincent et al., 2012).\n\nvariability across the region. In examining mean annual temperature trends, research (Danny Blair \n\nand Ryan Smith, University of Winnipeg, personal communication, 2015) demonstrates that most of \n\n\n\nperiod from 1981 to 2013 (Figure 4). However, this indicates the importance of long-term records in \n\n\n\n\n\nregion show a cooling trend (Vincent et al., 2012; Bush et al., 2014).\n', ' 114CHAPTER 5: THE PRAIRIES 114Figure 4: Trends in mean annual temperature for the Prairie provinces for the period 1981 to 2013. \n\n per-century trends. (Source: Danny Blair)\nTrends in mean annual precipitation for the Prairies are much weaker than trends in mean annual \n\n\nexperiencing the largest inter-annual variability of any records in Canada (Sauchyn, 2010). Again, \n\n\n\nchanges at only a handful of sites on the Prairies, and these show both increasing and decreasing \n\nprecipitation (Bush et al., 2014).\n', ' 115CHAPTER 5: THE PRAIRIES 115Figure 5: Trends in mean annual precipitation for the Prairie provinces for the period 1981 to 2013. \n\ncentury trends. (Source: Danny Blair)\n\nprecipitation has increased. Heavy precipitation events show no strong trend, with sites recording \n\nboth increases and decreases in the number of heavy precipitation days for the period from 1950 to \n\n2010 (Bush et al., 2014). Like other sites in southern Canada, the Prairies are experiencing a decrease \n\nin the snow-to-rain ratio (Mekis and Vincent, 2011). While no trend is evident in the frequency and \n\nseverity of drought in the Prairies over the 20\nth century (Bonsal et al., 2011), global analysis shows a \ntrend towards more severe drought conditions over Western Canada during the second half of the \n\n20th century (Dai, 2011; Seneviratne et al., 2012). \n', ' 116CHAPTER 5: THE PRAIRIES 116Trends in extreme weather in the Prairies are also \nimportant. Research suggests that May-June \n\n\n\n(Szeto et al., 2015). \n3.2 PROJECTIONSTemperatures in the Prairies are projected to rise under all climate scenarios, with associated changes \n\nin evapotranspiration leading to increased aridity in many areas (Sauchyn and Kulshreshtha, 2008). \n\nUnder a low-emissions scenario, warming will increase only slightly from historic trends; however, under \n\n\n\ngreatest warming will continue to be experienced in winter, with the least occurring during summer.  \nProjections of precipitation changes show \ntotal precipitation increasing over the northern \n\nPrairies, with relatively minor changes projected \n\nfor southern areas (Bush et al., 2014). Again \n\nchanges are more significant under higher-\n\nemission scenarios. In the southwestern \n\nPrairies, decreases in summer precipitation are \n\nprojected under high-emission scenarios. While \n\nthe southern Prairies have been identified as a \n\nregion with a higher likelihood of experiencing \n\nmore frequent drought in future (Bonsal et al., \n\n2013), there is no strong agreement between \n\nprojections of various climate models (Bush \n\net al., 2014). Instances of extreme rainfall \n\nare likely to increase in tandem with warmer \n\ntemperatures, while instances of freezing rain \n\nare likely to increase while snow cover declines \n\nover the 21st century (Kharin and Zwiers, 2000; \nBush et al., 2014).Sea level changes are important for the Port of \nChurchill. Currently, the land at Churchill is rising \n\nat a rate of 9.3 mm/year, a product of glacial \n\nisostatic adjustment as the earth™s crust responds \n\nto the melting of the ice sheets more than 10,000 \n\nyears ago (Atkinson et al., 2016). This strong \n\nvertical uplift means that sea level at Churchill \n\nwill continue to fall through the current century, \n\ndespite rising global sea level. The projected \n\nrange of sea-level decline at Churchill is about \n\n35 to 40 cm by 2050, and 60 to 80 cm by 2100, \n\nalthough a decrease of more than 1 m is possible \n\nby 2100 (James et al., 2014) (Figure 6). Even \n\nunder a very high global sea-level rise scenario, \n\nsea level at Churchill would not likely rise by more \n\nthan a few centimeters.  \nFigure 6:  Projected changes in sea level for \nChurchill, Manitoba. \nUnder almost all scenarios, sea level will fall as a result of glacial \n\nisostatic adjustments, despite the fact that \nglobal sea level will continue to rise. See \nAtkinson et al. (2016) for scenario descriptions \nand James et al. (2014) for projected sea-level \n\nchanges by decade.

Examples \nof these impacts include: \n Increased frequencies of freeze-thaw cycles over the short term, damaging roads, rails, and \n\nrunways; Compromised frozen substrates of winter roads; and \n Increased rutting of heated pavement (Sauchyn and Kulshreshta, 2008).\n\n Cost reductions associated with non-ice road infrastructure;\n Reductions in the length and severity of the frost-affected season, potentially resulting in long-term \n\nrepair and maintenance cost savings; and\n Reduced cold-weather damage to rails (Sauchyn and Kulshreshtha, 2008).\nEach mode can be expected to respond differently to climate-related risks. Sections 4, 5, 6, and 7 discuss \n\npast climate impacts, future risks, and adaptation practices separately for road, rail, air, and marine. \n4.0 ROAD TRANSPORTATION\n4.1 IMPACTS ON ROAD INFRASTRUCTURE\nExtreme precipitation events create problems for roadway drainage. Truckers in the Prairies report an \n\n\n\nattributed to inadequate culvert capacity (Kim Graybiel, Saskatchewan Ministry of Environment, \n\npersonal communication, 2015). Washout and bridge scour may also occur as a result of extreme \n\nprecipitation (Transportation Research Board, 2008).\nGreater variability in temperature contributes to more rapid deterioration of road infrastructure. It is \nexpected that the Prairies will experience an increase in the frequency of freeze-thaw cycles by mid-\n\ncentury (Sauchyn and Kulshreshtha, 2008), stressing road surfaces and bridges and increasing renewal \n\nand replacement costs (Amiro et al., 2014). Extreme heat causes asphalt pavements to rut and bleed \n\n(Transportation Research Board, 2008). \nDrought has also had negative impacts on road infrastructure in the Prairies. G\nreater Edmonton \nexperienced drought conditions from 2014-2015, leading to severe cracking of roadways as a result of \ndesiccation of clay sub-soils; this can be explained in part due to the removal of water by vegetation \n\n(Kelm and Wylie, 2008) Œ damage was particularly severe in neighbourhoods with mature tree stands. \n\n\n\n\n', ' 118CHAPTER 5: THE PRAIRIES 1184.2 IMPACTS TO TRUCKING OPERATIONS\nPrecipitation poses issues year-round to truck operators, and standing water on roadways is a \nparticular concern in spring (Alberta- and Manitoba-based trucking practitioners; Alberta Motor \n\nTransport Association Representatives, personal communication, 2015). Increasing instances of \n\nfreezing rain and extreme precipitation over the long term increase the likelihood of accidents and \n\nreduced travelling speeds (Transportation Research Board, 2008; Andrey and Mills, 2003).  \nWind is also a concern. More frequent high-intensity wind events in recent years have generated \nscheduling challenges and have increased safety concerns for trucking operators, particularly for \n\nlong combination vehicles (LCVs) on highways (Alberta- and Manitoba-based trucking practitioners, \n\npersonal communication, 2015).   \n\n\n\n\n\nResources Canada, 2016). \n\nroad transportation seasonally throughout the region Œ road and highway closures often occur in \n\n\n4.3 ADAPTATIONS FOR ROAD INFRASTRUCTURE\nProvincial governments have been active in implementing adaptive strategies.

This adaptive strategy includes \n\n\n\nreduce washout risks \n(Transportation and the Environment Task Force, 2014).\n\n\n\n\nrestriction season (Manitoba Infrastructure and Transportation Staff, personal communication, 2015). \n\nThese restrictions minimize road damage from heavy trucks during the spring thaw when roadbeds \n\nare relatively soft. In response to more variable temperature and weather conditions, the program \n\nhas been adjusted to allow variable start and end dates (Government of Manitoba, 2015b).\n The \n\n\nand Transportation Staff, personal communication, 2015). Adjusting these programs cost very little \n\n\nThe Government of Manitoba is also reviewing its approach to water control on roadways to maintain \n\n \n larger bridges capable of withstanding intense precipitation; \n the use of more appropriate erosion-control mechanisms such as riprap and dikes; \nand, \n.  The province is also assessing d\nesign standards for provincial bridges and culverts to determine if \n\nupdates are required to accommodate changes in climate, land use, surface water drainage, and \n\n(Government of Manitoba, 2015c). Major\n\nof these efforts. \n', ' 119CHAPTER 5: THE PRAIRIES 119With respect to possible temperature extremes, Manitoba Infrastructure and Transportation currently \nrequires that bridge and large-culvert construction materials be designed to withstand a temperature \n\nrange of 80°C (-40°C to +40°C). To mitigate impacts of freeze-thaw cycles, highly durable and \n\nimpermeable concrete mixes are required for bridge decks and curbs/barriers, reducing moisture \n\n\nAlberta™s provincial government has undertaken climate risk assessments for road infrastructure. In \nJune 2012, Alberta™s Ministry of Transportation released its ﬁClimate Change Risk Assessment and \n\nAdaptation Report for the Ministry of Transportation,ﬂ a high-level assessment of risks posed by a \n\n\n\nmeasures, developed in accordance with ISO 31000 Risk Management Principles and Guidelines. \n\nDuring the department™s enterprise risk-management and business-planning processes, long-term risks \n\n(based on climate scenarios for the next 50 years) were considered along with risks in the near (2 -to \n\n10-year) term. Plans also exist to review climate risks as new and updated climate change scenarios \n\nbecome available, and identify potential options to reduce the severity of impacts (ICF Marbek, \n\n2012). \n\npeople were killed, more than 100,000 were displaced, and damage exceeded $5 billion (see \n\nChapter 9). In terms of insurable damages, it is the costliest disaster in Canadian history (Environment \n\nCanada, 2014). In response, Alberta announced several risk-mitigation actions. In November 2013, the \n\nprovincial government announced $110 million (2014-2016) for a Flood Mitigation Program, providing \n\n\n\n\n\nto account for $40 million, with the remaining $70 million dedicated to high priority sites susceptible \n\n\n\ndiscussed in Case Studies 1 and 2.In addition to these long-term planning initiatives, Alberta government representatives indicate that \na case-by-case approach to infrastructure adaptation is being taken in the province. Calgary™s 2013 \n\n\n\n\n\nlevels, development in vulnerable areas was a factor contributing to the magnitude and costs of the \n\ndamage (Alberta Government Staff, personal communication, 2015). \nSaskatchewan™s provincial government is attempting to build climate risks into asset-management \n\n\nMinistry of Environment, personal communication, 2015). In response to extreme weather events, \n\nSaskatchewan™s culvert program alters design requirements for National Highway System infrastructure \n\n\n\nare being changed from a 1-in-50 year event to a 1-in-100 year event (Transportation and the \n\n\n\nmovement of water, to reduce incidences of water being held back by road or rail beds to the point \n\nwhere washouts occur.\n', ' 120CHAPTER 5: THE PRAIRIES 120CASE STUDY 1: ALBERTA TRANSPORTATION™S ADAPTATION \nEFFORTS IN THE ROAD SECTOR\nAlberta Transportation has developed a number of initiatives that consider climate and extreme weather in \nhighway and bridge design processes.

Therefore, there is a low \n\nrisk of sudden change in bridge-opening capacity requirements.\n \n \n\nlikely to change in comparison to the frequency of high-intensity, short-duration, limited-area storms. \n\n\nprovince™s 150-year historical record.\nBridge-deck drainage design requirements were also evaluated, focusing on sites where drainage \nblockages have occurred and maintenance is commonly required. Localized, high-intensity weather \n\n\nAs a result, the most cost-effective method to address culvert blockages is to design infrastructure in \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly, concrete box culverts at Cougar Creek were prone to blockage, and are now designed to \n\nbe cleared by machinery.

While season \n\nlengths vary by road, most ice roads in the Prairies operate for approximately eight weeks from mid-\n\nJanuary to mid-March.

In Saskatchewan, the Cumberland \n\nHouse road may have experienced slightly delayed opening dates in recent years, but closing dates \n\nhave also been delayed (Federal/Provincial/Territorial Sub-working Group on Northern Transportation, \n\n2015). Manitoba is also experiencing irregularities in the winter road season\n (Case Study 3). \n\nbusinesses use these roads to transport important supplies such as chemicals, fuel, and other daily \n\nessentials for residents, businesses, and public utilities (CBC News, 2012a). Residents use ice roads to \n\naccess urban areas and purchase supplies in bulk, reducing the household impact of high living-costs \n', ' 123CHAPTER 5: THE PRAIRIES 123in remote northern communities. If ice is not thick enough for transit by mid-January, a modal shift \nfrom trucks to aviation for essential goods is required, at great expense to all users (Taylor and Parry, \n\n2014). When ice roads eventually open in mild winters, load restrictions can be applied (CBC News, \n\n2012b). Recent winter-road experiences in Manitoba are discussed in Case Study 3.\nCASE STUDY 3: WINTER ROADS IN MANITOBAManitoba has the majority of the Prairies™ winter roads (78 percent of winter road km), serving 30,000 \npeople in 28 remote communities (Taylor and Parry, 2014). In Northern Manitoba, winters from 1998 to 2003 \n\nand 2009 to 2012 featured below-average operating seasons on most roads (Taylor and Parry, 2014; Table \n1). Between 2007 and 2011, the average cost of the winter-road network rose to $13 million annually, and \nfunding for winter roads has tripled since 1998 (Rabson, 2012; Manitoba Infrastructure and Transportation, \n\n2011). In 2012, the province™s 2500 km network opened several weeks later than normal, prompting \n\nNorthern Chiefs to declare a state of emergency (CBC News, 2012b). \nDespite a decline in season length from 2009 to 2012, data for routes in Manitoba (Table 1) suggest \noperating windows have recovered in recent years. Seasons from 2013 to 2015 slightly exceeded the \n\n12-season average from 2003 to 2015 (48 operational days)\n. Over this period, MIT recorded opening and \nclosing dates for up to 50 distinct road segments operated in the major East Side Lake Winnipeg (ESLW) \narea. Routings were frequently changed, often to move the roads off ice-covered waterways and onto \nland routes (Taylor and Parry, 2014). Routing changes presented some challenges in efforts to quantify \n\nwinter-road operating days, but these changes likely extended operational seasons for many routes. A shift \n\ntowards more land-based roads has also offered greater safety during construction, maintenance, and \n\nuse (Taylor and Parry, 2014). However, operating days are not the only relevant variable Œ many factors are \ninvolved in determining the relative success of different winter road seasons in moving goods to remote \nareas in recent years.  These include routing changes, the polar vortex breakup of 2013-2014, varying \n\nweight restrictions, frost depth, snow cover, etc. \nFuture projections estimate average loss to the province™s future ice-road season at eight days by the \n2020s, 15 days by mid-century, and 21 days by the 2080s (Sauchyn and Kulshreshtha, 2008). In light of \nthese expected impacts, more drastic adaptation efforts Œ beyond shifting routes from waterways to land \n\nŒ are being made to improve reliability, particularly for remote communities.  For example, Manitoba is \n\nundertaking a large-scale infrastructure program ($3 billion over 30 years) to build permanent, all-weather \nroads in the ESLW area to serve remote communities with a collective population of approximately \n36,000 individuals (Manitoba East Side Road Authority, n.d.). The proposed routing of this network closely \n\napproximates the current winter-road network. While the rationale for this undertaking is multi-faceted, the \n\nfollowing supportive statement was made by the Eastside Road Authority ﬁ – over the years, the reliability \n\nand length of time that the winter roads are open has been lessening, resulting in hardships for local \nresidentsﬂ\n (Manitoba East Side Road Authority, n.d.). Other potential adaptations being considered include shifts to modes less costly than conventional \naviation such as, enhanced rail and ferry services (Manitoba Infrastructure and Transportation Staff, \n\nGovernment of Manitoba, personal communication, 2015). Manitoba Infrastructure and Transportation \ncurrently operates four ferries during open-water season. These ferries serve remote communities reliant \non winter roads, in the areas of South Indian Lake, Split Lake, York Landing, Bloodvein, and Norway \n\nHouse (Taylor and Parry, 2014).

Fouling \n\nlimits the ballast™s ability to shed water away from the track area (Michael Hendry, Canadian \n\nRail Research Laboratory, University of Alberta, personal communication, 2015) and reduces \n\nthe resistance of rail infrastructure to frost heaves (shifting soil or rock during freezing conditions) \n\n(Nurmikolu and Silvast, 2013). \nAnecdotally, standing water is an increasing problem. One long-time regional geotechnical \nexpert indicated seeing water against-grade in Saskatchewan in places not seen in 30 years in the \n\nbusiness (Tom Edwards, Canadian National Railway, personal communication, 2015).

While thermal \nrail expansion (buckling due to heat) has rarely been cited as an issue in the Prairies, extreme cold \n\nis a major concern for winter rail operations (Boyle et al., 2013). In cold temperatures, steel tracks \n\n(continuously welded rail) and wheels become more brittle and susceptible to breakage, and air-\n\nbraking systems become more prone to leaks and freezing. A review of Transportation Safety Board \n\nof Canada rail incident reports suggests that cold weather-related rail fractures have contributed to \n\nsome derailments in the Prairies (Transportation Safety Board of Canada, 2013). Cold temperatures \n\nalso create operational issues by limiting the safe length of trains. According to the Rail Association \n\nof Canada, the maximum safe length of an intermodal train with distributed power decreases by 15 \n\npercent below 25°C and 39 percent below -35°C. Shorter trains operating in a network near capacity \n\nwith relatively long cycle times results in cascading effects throughout the rail system. Increased \n\n\n\nencountering one another, increasing use of sidings and further reducing average speeds (Miller, \n\n2014). Extreme cold temperatures were an important contributing factor to delays in grain handling in \n\nthe winter of 2013-2014 (Case Study 4).While instances of extreme cold are projected to decrease in the Prairies, these periods will still occur \nat unpredictable intervals (Bush et al., 2014). During periods of extreme heat in the 21\nst century, rail \nbuckling risks will also increase (Transportation Research Board, 2008). These impacts illustrate both \n\ncurrent and future risks posed by temperature extremes to rail-freight transportation. \nCASE STUDY 4: RAIL-FREIGHT MOVEMENT IN WINTER 2013-2014 \nMoving grain to port via rail in the Prairies in the winter of 2013-2014 has been described as a ﬁperfect \nstormﬂ of issues (Cash, 2014). Grain handling in the region is a complex process involving many actors. In \n\nthis particular year, a series of events and conditions complicated the process further, including:\n an above-average Prairie crop yield;\n the removal of the Canadian Wheat Board single-desk marketing mechanism;\n increased orders for car placement by grain companies wishing to move product;\n delayed initial orders for car placement; and\n an extremely cold winter in the Prairies (Miller, 2014; Atkins, 2014).\nAs illustrated in Figure 8, most of the Prairies experienced lower-than-average temperatures in winter \n2013-2014 Œ up to 4.5°C lower in some areas. The following discussion is based primarily upon information \nregarding CN operations during this period.\nIn the 2013-2014 winter season, trains operated below the -25°C threshold more frequently than normal (Miller, \ncapacity), more frequent rail breaks (200 percent higher than non-winter norms), and more frequent steel \n\nwheel breaks. \nIn response, rail companies reduced train lengths and speeds. Average grain-train length was reportedly \n70 percent as long as it could have been under ideal temperature conditions. This caused a cascading \neffect, primarily driven by increased network congestion.  \nAverage train speed was also reduced over this period. In winter, trains normally operate at speeds approximately \n8 percent lower than in other seasons. In 2013-2014, this reduction was approximately 13 percent.

The rail line (and its original ballast) was laid over the \nwinter of 1928-1929 atop frozen muskeg, the season when track stability is greatest. As temperatures warm, \nthe ballast has been dissipating into the muskeg, resulting in more frequent remediation.  For example, in \n\nJune-July 2014, OmniTRAX added 40,000 tonnes of ballast under the Gillam-to-Churchill section of the rail \n\nline (Tweed, 2015), following the previous year™s remediation effort, which added 15,000 tonnes of ballast.  \n\n\n\naccelerating.Given projections for long-term warming in the Hudson Bay Lowlands, supporting the rail bed will become \n\n\n(Wang et al., 2016), although others may become more feasible.

Another approach to stabilizing \nmuskeg in the rail bed involves mixing cement with the vegetative mat (provided shifting muskeg can be \ncontrolled); however, this option requires further testing and evaluation given that frozen substrate makes it \n\n\n\n2015).

Some air carriers operating in the Prairie provinces have reported \n\n\n\nevents.  Airport representatives and provincial administrators of non-National Airport System airports \n\nand aerodromes have similarly cited concerns with a greater frequency of these events.   \n\nin the south, and practitioners suggest that the costs of weather variability have been particularly \n\n\n\nis generally higher than their northern counterparts as a result of more readily-available ground \n\nequipment and system redundancies (Calm Air Representatives, personal communication, 2015). \nSmaller airports in the northern Prairies have experienced specific challenges with standing water \non runways. Particularly in springtime, precipitation percolates into the runway base, softening \n\nthe surface area. When aircraft land on these softened runways, depressions are formed, \n\nallowing greater opportunity for the accumulation of standing water. In an effort to minimize \n\nthe formation of depressions, carriers reduce their payloads (Calm Air Representatives, personal \n\ncommunication, 2015).\nincrease in delays due to weather variability, particularly in the northern Prairies. This has partly \n\ncontributed to an increased need for aircraft de-icing. Increased variance in temperature has \n\nresulted in a greater frequency of ideal conditions for ice formation on the control surfaces of aircraft \n\n(Calm Air Representatives, personal communication, 2015). De-icing stations are rare in northern \n\nPrairie communities, often resulting in prolonged delays for aircraft departures.\nExtreme cold also affects aviation operations. All aircraft have a range of temperature for which \n\n\n\n\n\n\nthan high temperatures. For instance, in the cold winter of 2013-2014, some U.S. carriers™ scheduled \n\n\n\nscheduling disruptions have been reported to occur with greater frequency in response to more rapid \n\ntemperature shifts, something to which the Prairies is prone. \n', ' 132CHAPTER 5: THE PRAIRIES 1326.2 ADAPTATION PRACTICES \nINFRASTRUCTURE \n\nprecipitation (Perimeter Aviation Representatives, personal communication, 2015).\n For example, \ncertain types of sealants are being used on gravel airstrips.

The sealant assists in reducing the percolation of moisture into \n\nthe runway base material, and instances of standing water, which helps to reduce traction issues for \n\naircraft trying to land on shorter runways (International Civil Aviation Organization Secretariat, 2010). \nOPERATIONS\nAir carriers operating in the Prairies report some changes to operations and equipment to better \n\nmanage the challenges posed by weather and changing climate conditions. As an adaptation to \n\nscheduling disruptions in remote northern communities, carriers have expanded ground facilities \n\n\n\nbusiness hours and continue on their route. Ground transportation services can then pick up and \n\ndistribute freight during business hours.  Carriers in northern communities that lack de-icing stations are \n\nalso using portable de-icing mechanisms to deal with more frequent icing. \nTo adapt to more frequent fog events, one carrier in Saskatchewan has reported making scheduling \nchanges to allow fog to dissipate, moving early morning departures to late morning for some \n\ncommunities (Lloyd Epp, West Wind Aviation, personal communication, 2015).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.0 MARINE TRANSPORTATION\n\n\npatterns of extreme weather, and describes adaptive efforts to cope with these impacts.

Certain \n\nareas in the higher northern latitudes, including Hudson Bay (and Churchill, Manitoba), are likely to \n\ncontinue to experience sea-level decline throughout the 21\nst century as a result of isostatic adjustment \n(glacial uplift) (Bush et al., 2014). Therefore, Churchill is likely to be one of the few ports in Canada not \n\nadversely affected by sea-level rise and more severe storm surges. At present, Churchill experiences \n\n3 m tides. Increased mean temperatures are likely to result in a shorter sea-ice season, extending \n\nChurchill™s shipping season (currently about 14 weeks). However, sea-level decline along Hudson Bay™s \n\nwestern coast could increase navigational challenges for large vessels attempting to take advantage \n\nof the extended season.', ' 133CHAPTER 5: THE PRAIRIES 1337.2 MARINE INFRASTRUCTURE AND OPERATIONAL ADAPTATIONS\nTransition measures were put in place to help the port adjust to the end of the Canada Wheat Board \nin 2012. Capital improvements funds were designed to encourage some diversity in port operations, \n\nexpanding port capacity beyond its traditional focus on outbound bulk-grain handling to include \n\nother movement systems, including intermodal operations (Transportation and the Environment Task \n\nForce, 2014). Although these improvements are unlikely to be explicitly linked to climate change \n\nadaptation, a shift in short-sea shipping capacity may have implications for an extended marine \n\nresupply season.  The owner and operator of the Port of Churchill reports that water levels at the \n\nwharves have been trending downwards, suggesting the only adaptation that would be required is \n\ndredging of the harbour (Jeff McEachern, OmniTrax Canada, personal communication, 2015).\nThe Port of Churchill™s capacity to load vessels has been idle for much of each year, as the shipping \nseason normally covers about 14 weeks from mid-July to late October. If the ice-free season is \n\nextended, more activity could be supported without substantial infrastructure improvements. \n\nChallenges remain for the Port of Churchill, although these are primarily inland, and deal with surface \n\naccess to the port from southern shipping distribution points (discussed in Case Study 5).\n Case Study 7 describes the results and recommendations of a recent PIEVC assessment completed \n\nfor transportation infrastructure connecting Manitoba and Nunavut, including Churchill™s marine \n\ncomponents.CASE STUDY 7: CLIMATE CHANGE VULNERABILITY AND THE \nMANITOBA-NUNAVUT SUPPLY CHAIN\nA recent study (Duguid et al., 2015) examined key infrastructure supporting the supply of goods and \nservices between Northern Manitoba and Nunavut™s Kivalliq region. The project aimed to identify potential \n\nvulnerabilities associated with a changing climate, northern economic development, and growing \npopulations. Climate change is likely to put direct physical stress on this northern supply-chain infrastructure, \nwhile simultaneously increasing demand and performance expectations\n. The study™s recommendations \nincluded:1. Development and use of an integrated supply chain model that supports a systematic understanding of how decisions could affect the supply chain as a whole. \n2. Integrated governance\n for transportation infrastructure supporting the North. \n3. Integrated planning and strategic investment strategy for northern transportation infrastructure. \nThe study analyzed the engineering vulnerability of the Port of Churchill, the Thompson Freight Services \nHub, and the Rankin Inlet Airport to current and future conditions via the\n Public Infrastructure Engineering \nVulnerability Committee (PIEVC) protocol\n. The assessment determined that none of the assets are at high \n\nrisk of impact, although all three had numerous medium risks. It was recommended that medium risks \n\nbe closely monitored and that most of these risks would affect operations, while very few would affect \n\ninfrastructure. While some risks may be managed by increasing materials, labour, and costs, others cannot \nbe controlled and in these cases, preparedness for interruptions and delays and regular maintenance of \ninfrastructure were recommended.\nHowever, while individual transportation facilities themselves may be relatively robust, the overall system \nmay be vulnerable. The infrastructure Œ built with reference to historic levels of demand and climate trends \nŒ has been expanded on an ad hoc basis and focused on local needs, often without consideration for the \nimpacts on the broader system and the communities it supports. \nCASE STUDY 7–', ' 134CHAPTER 5: THE PRAIRIES 1348.0 INFORMATION GAPS\n AND CONCLUSIONSThis chapter summarizes the state of knowledge on climate impacts, risks, and adaptation \npractices for transportation systems in the Prairies, based on available literature and practitioner \n\n\n\ntransportation in the Prairies, suggesting few researchers have focused on this topic in the region.\nThere are gaps in climate data important to transportation operators. While long-term climate \nprojections (temperature and precipitation) may be useful for long-term infrastructure planning, \n\nadditional information would be useful on projected changes in the expected frequency and severity \n\nof extreme weather events. Prairie governments and operators have been investing in weather \n\nmonitoring and communications to reduce risks from extreme weather, but more accurate predictions \n\nof the locations and timing of these events would be useful for short- and medium-term operational \nplanning.  \n\nmodes at the provincial and regional level. For example, data is not reported on the frequency of \n\naircraft being redirected to alternate airports, or the frequency of aircraft ﬁgo-aroundsﬂ (i.e. aborted \n\n\n\nevents on  operational indicators at airports.Despite these information gaps, governments and operators in the Prairies have been making efforts \nto reduce future climate risks to infrastructure and operations, particularly those associated with \n\nprecipitation. Flood-control strategies, intended to reduce future risks of washout, represent key \n\nadaptation strategies in all three Prairie provinces.\nAt the same time, transportation operators in the Prairies have tended to take a reactive, case-\nby-case approach to climate and weather adaptation. As information and knowledge improves \n\non longer-term climate risks, transportation decision-makers in the Prairies will be able to be more \n\nproactive in their adaptation efforts.\n\nsupply chain include: the rail line between Thompson and Churchill, which has been heavily and repeatedly affected by \n\npermafrost degradation and is vulnerable to delays and disruptions; and\n \n\n–', ' 135CHAPTER 5: THE PRAIRIES 135REFERENCESAddison, P., Oommmen, T., and Lautala, P.

Recent extreme weather events (in both summer and winter) demonstrate the vulnerability of \nOntario™s transportation networks to climate-related impacts.\n\n\n\ndamage and travel disruption, but also spurred greater organisational awareness of the region™s \n\nvulnerability to more frequent extreme weather. Multiple resilience-enhancing initiatives have \n\nbeen undertaken in the wake of these events by public agencies, particularly for roads and rail.\n Warming temperatures\n and changing precipitation patterns are\n expected to contribute to altered \n(increased or decreased) water levels in the Great Lakes basin, with implications for shipping \n\ncapacity in the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Seaway.\n Fluctuations over the past 20-30 years make it \n\n\nother modes should trends toward lower water levels throughout the Great Lakes occur again.\n The access period for winter roads in Northern Ontario is likely to decrease as a result of warming \n\ntemperatures.\n This carries economic impacts for remote northern communities; a modal shift from \n\n\nresilient road infrastructure in Northern Ontario. \n Practitioners in Ontario have begun to assess the vulnerability of their assets, and in some cases, \nadapt their infrastructure and operations in preparation for changing climate conditions. \nEfforts \nmade by the Ontario Ministry of Transportation (roads and bridges), Metrolinx (rail), the Greater \n\nToronto Airport Authority (aviation), and the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Seaway Management \n\n\n1.0 REGIONAL INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW\nOntario is Canada™s second-largest province in terms of area, and largest in terms of population. \n\nWhile its population density (14.1 persons per km2\n(3.7 persons per km2) (Statistics Canada, 2012), many areas of the province are remote, isolated from \n\n\neffective surface, marine, and air transportation systems for passengers and freight in this context \n\nis complex. A changing climate makes these challenges greater. Temperature and precipitation \n\npatterns are projected to shift considerably by mid-century, and projected increases in the frequency \n\nand intensity of severe weather events present serious risks for Ontario™s transportation system (e.g. \n\n\n\ndisruptions), in the absence of effective adaptation action. \nNot all effects of a changing climate will be negative. Most research has focused on the potential \nnegative impacts of climate change, and positive impacts may not be well-understood (Chiotti and \n\n\n\nprimary focus is on transportation-related risks.\nOntario™s transportation network will be discussed with reference to three distinct sub-regions \n(northern, central, and southern [see Figure 1]) in order to capture the province™s geographic, \n\nsocial, and economic diversity; different capacities for climate change adaptation; and the unique \n\nadaptive measures required. While Ontario™s adaptive capacity is relatively high due to its aggregate \n\neconomic wealth, education levels, infrastructure, social capital, and institutions, this capacity is not \n\nevenly distributed throughout the province (Chiotti and Lavender, 2008). Each sub-region is described \n\n\n\nNote that while this chapter recognizes the importance of urban transportation networks in Ontario, \n\nmunicipal climate impacts and adaptation practices are discussed in Chapter 9.  \n', ' 142CHAPTER 6: ONTARIO\n 142This chapter involved an extensive review of both scholarly and grey (non-peer reviewed) literature, \n\n\n\n\nconsidered an exhaustive inventory of experiences, impacts, and adaptations. \nFigure 1: Boundaries of Ontario™s three sub-regions.  \n(Source: Natural Resources Canada)\n1.1 GEOGRAPHYSOUTHERN SUB-REGIONOntario™s southern sub-region extends from Canada™s southernmost location (Point Pelee) east to the \n\n\n\nin the Niagara escarpment region (Chiotti and Lavender, 2008). It contains eight of Canada™s 16 most \n\ndensely-populated metropolitan centres, including the urban regions of the Greater Golden Horseshoe \n\n(centered around the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area), and the City of Ottawa in the east. This \n\n\n\nand agriculture.  Southwestern\n Ontario has a temperate, humid climate, with warm summers and \n\ncold winters. For communities in this area, the Great Lakes have a moderating effect on temperature, \n\n\n\nduring the summer, and produce a ﬁsnowbeltﬂ effect in the winter (Baldwin et al, 2011; Gula and Peltier, \n\n2012). Southeastern Ontario is characterized by relatively longer winters and shorter summers than in the \n\nsouthwest, although annual precipitation levels are comparable (Baldwin et al, 2011). \n', ' 143CHAPTER 6: ONTARIO\n 143CENTRAL SUB-REGIONThe central sub-region, which includes Sudbury, Thunder Bay, and Timmins, is composed almost \nentirely of the forested and rocky terrain of the Precambrian Shield. Its summers are humid and mild, \n\nand precipitation is distributed evenly throughout the seasons (Baldwin et al, 2011). There are many \n\nlow-density, resource-dependent communities, notably in the forestry, pulp-and-paper, mining, \n\nand tourism sectors. It contains two-thirds of Ontario™s highway system, which along with the rail \n\nnetwork, is important in connecting the area™s resource producers to markets in other areas of the \n\nprovince, country, and continent (Chiotti and Lavender, 2008). The sub-region™s remote communities \n\nand extractive industries also depend greatly on more than 3,000 km of seasonal-access roads for \n\neconomic well-being, social stability, and surface freight movement in winter (Ontario Ministry of \n\nNorthern Development and Mines, 2013).\nNORTHERN SUB-REGION\nThe northern sub-region extends from the upper boundary of Central Ontario to the coasts of Hudson \n\nand James Bay. The topography and landscape are largely low-lying and poorly-drained, containing \n\nthe majority of the province™s permafrost in the cryosolic (i.e. frozen) soils of the northwest (Baldwin et \n\nal, 2011). Northern Ontario has a subarctic climate, with long, severe winters and short, cool summers. \n\n\n\nprecipitation is lower than in other sub-regions (Baldwin et al, 2011). Northern communities are also \n\nremote, and many rely solely upon aviation for connectivity.\n1.2 SOCIAL AND DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICSOntario is the fastest-growing province in Canada, with an estimated population of 13.8 million in 2015 \n\n\nst century, \nwith implications for future demands on passenger and freight transportation systems throughout the \n\nprovince. Approximately 17.4 million people are projected by 2036 (Ontario Ministry of Finance, 2013).\nEighty-nine percent of the province™s population lives within Census Metropolitan Areas (CMAs) or \nCensus Agglomerations (CAs) (Statistics Canada, 2012). Most of the province™s future growth will \n\ncontinue to be concentrated in urban areas; therefore, Ontarians will increasingly live and work in \n\ndenser, more transit-accessible neighborhoods. The Greater Golden Horseshoe (GGH) in Southern \n\nOntario will absorb most of this growth, primarily through immigration (Ontario Ministry of Finance, 2013). \nTable 1: Population projections to 2036 for each sub-region, based on census data analysis by \nStatistics Canada and the Ontario Ministry of Finance.

The following sections introduce and explore each mode \n\nin greater depth.\nFigure 2: Principle transportation infrastructure in Ontario, including permafrost zones. \n', ' 146CHAPTER 6: ONTARIO\n 1462.1 ROAD TRANSPORTATION\nOntario™s highway system includes over 16,600 km of provincially-managed highways, 2,756 bridges, over 1,800 \nkm of the TransCanada Highway system, and an extensive regional/municipal road network (Ontario Ministry of \n\nNorthern Development and Mines, 2012\n). There is an extensive user base for this network, which is presented in \nFigure 3. In 2013, Ontario had over 11 million active road vehicle registrations, including 7.6 million light vehicles \n\n(e.g., cars, pickup trucks, and vans) and 237,000 heavy vehicles (e.g., buses and tractor-trailers); the rest of this \n\n\nThe road system is an essential component of Canada™s international and interprovincial trading network. \nIn 2015, trucking accounted for 68.9 percent of the value of Ontario™s trade with the United States (Transport \n\nCanada, adapted from Statistics Canada, International Trade database). The Ambassador Bridge border \n\n\n\nUnited States in 2015 (Transport Canada, 2016).\nNorthern and Central Ontario features more than 3,000 km of winter roads, linking remote communities to the \nprovincial highway network (Federal/Provincial/Territorial Sub-Working Group on Northern Transportation, 2015). \n\nOntario™s winter roads are built and maintained by 29 First Nations communities and the Town of Moosonee, \n\n\n\nonly seasonal access (typically from December to March), they are far less costly than constructing all-weather \n\nroads on Arctic terrain, which has been estimated at USD$85,000 (CAD$111,758) per road-km and USD$64,000-\n\n150,000 (CAD$84,147-197,220)4 per bridge (Prowse et al, 2009; Dore and Burton, 2001).  \nFigure 3: Road infrastructure in Ontario. \n4  All values related to costs of impacts and adaptations in this chapter are presented in 2015 Canadian dollars.

While VIA operates on a 12,500 km rail network, 98 \n\npercent of this track is owned and operated by CN, CP, and other partners (VIA Rail, 2015). Ontario \n\nNorthland also offers freight and passenger services from Cochrane (in the central sub-region) to \n\nMoosonee (in the North).Ontario™s rail network also includes: \n 10 local and regional freight operators; \n 11 tourist railways; \n Three light-rail and metro (i.e. subway) systems (Toronto, Ottawa, and Kitchener-Waterloo by \n2017); and The GO Transit system, providing regional passenger services in Southern Ontario (Railway \n\nAssociation of Canada, 2014). \nMetrolinx, a provincial agency responsible for regional transportation planning in the Greater Toronto \n\nand Hamilton Area (GTHA), has been upgrading rail throughout Southern Ontario in recent years \n\n(Transport Canada, 2014). Notable projects include the Union-Pearson Express, Eglinton Crosstown LRT, \n\nand the Regional Express Rail (RER) initiative, a 10-year plan to provide faster and more frequent GO \n\nTransit service and electrify core segments of the rail network.\nOntario™s rail sector is relatively stable, although operational track-kilometres are declining (Statistics \nCanada, 2015b). In total, Ontario operated 16 thousand km of track for both freight and passenger \n\nservices in 2013 Œ a 15.5 percent decrease from 2009 (Statistics Canada, 2015b). Other recent trends \n\nin Ontario™s rail sector include:  \n Cargo originating in Ontario and destined for other provinces and international markets declined \n\n20 percent from 2001 to 2013 (Statistics Canada, 2015c). \n Goods transported by rail into Ontario from other provinces and North American jurisdictions \n\ndeclined 18 percent from 2001 to 2013 (Statistics Canada, 2015c).  \n \n\ncontributing to changes in service patterns (Transport Canada, 2015). \n In contrast, ridership on the GO Transit network increased approximately 28 percent from 2007 to \n\n2013, representing a growing segment of Ontario™s commuter market (Metrolinx, 2014). \n2.3 MARINE TRANSPORTATION\nThe Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Seaway (the Seaway) is the most important stretch of navigable \n\nwater in Canada, encompassing four Great Lakes with Ontario shoreline and the St. Lawrence River. \n\nHundreds of other lakes and rivers in Ontario, particularly in the northern and central sub-regions, also \n\n\n', ' 148CHAPTER 6: ONTARIO\n 148The Seaway is a 3,700-km managed watercourse that became fully navigable in 1959. It operates \nthrough a series of locks, and contains other valuable infrastructure (including harbours, and \n\nnavigation equipment) that enables direct international trade with the United States, Europe, and \n\nbeyond. Approximately 30,000 tonnes of freight originates in or is destined for Ontario by domestic \n\nwaterways annually (Statistics Canada, 2010).The Seaway has historically been a critical path for Prairie exporters shipping grain to eastern markets, \nwith the most important transcontinental transfer and access point to the Great Lakes system located \n\non the north shore of Lake Superior at Thunder Bay (Martin Associates, 2011). Most shipping journeys \n\n\n\nis approximately 1,967 km (102 hours of sailing and 17 hours in the locks) (St. Lawrence Seaway \n\nManagement Corporation, 2014). Important commodities transported through Ontario™s segment of \n\nthe Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Seaway include: \n Agricultural crops (40 percent), \n Mining products (40 percent), \n Iron and steel products (10 percent), and \n ﬁOtherﬂ goods, including forestry, animal, and petroleum products (10 percent) (Martin \n\nAssociates, 2011).2.4 AIR TRANSPORTATION\nAir travel has been gaining importance and market share for both passenger and cargo movement \n\nin Ontario. In 2013, 452,000 tonnes of cargo were loaded and unloaded at Ontario™s airports (an \n\nincrease of approximately 5,000 tonnes from 2010), and approximately \n45 million passengers passed \nthrough Ontario terminals (see Figure 2 for principle airports).  Approximately 35 million of these \n\nboardings and departures occurred at Toronto™s Pearson International Airport, which is Canada™s \n\nbusiest airport (Transport Canada, 2015). Passenger volume in the province has increased by almost 1 \n\nmillion passengers annually since 2010 (Statistics Canada, 2016). \n\nCanada™s air industry and airport divestiture program. As a result, private interests and quasi-public \n\nauthorities are now responsible for the capital and operational demands of air infrastructure in many \n\ncommunities (for example, regional airports), although provincial and federal governments continue \n\n\n\nthat climate adaptation efforts for air infrastructure will involve many levels of government, with a \n\nmajor role for the private sector.\n', ' 149CHAPTER 6: ONTARIO\n 1493.0 CLIMATE TRENDS AND PROJECTIONS \nThis section provides a brief overview of some observed and projected changes in Ontario™s climate \nin order to convey the direction and magnitude of future changes. More detailed information is \n\navailable from several sources, including the Ontario Centre for Climate Impacts and Adaptation \n\nResources and the Ontario Climate Consortium.\n3.1 OBSERVED CLIMATE TRENDS \nThroughout Ontario, mean annual surface air temperatures have increased by a range of \n\napproximately 1.0-1.5°C from 1948 to 2012, while central and northern regions experienced slightly \n\n\n\nwarmer winters, average annual ice cover throughout the Great Lakes declined by 71 percent from \n\n1973 to 2012 (Kahl and Stirrat, 2012). \n\nincreases occurring in the North (Vincent et al., 2015).

Analysis in trends of short-duration extreme rainfall for Canada (research including regional \n\nand provincial analysis for Ontario) shows that increasing trends are more common than decreasing \n\n\nThe Great Lakes are not considered susceptible to sea level rise, given their respective elevations \nabove sea level (74 metres in the case of Lake Ontario and 183 metres for Lake Superior) coupled \n\n\n\n\n\n2012 (Shlozberg et al, 2014); however, the cold winters of 2013 and 2014 (which featured extensive \n\nwinter lake-ice coverage and cooler temperatures) broke this trend, with water-level increases \n\nin all lakes (Dorling and Hanniman, 2016; Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory, 2015). \n\nRegardless, the long-term impacts of climate change on water levels will not be clear for some time, \n\nas results of the International Upper Great Lakes Study suggest that ﬁnatural variabilityﬂ in Great Lakes \n\nwater levels may mask the effects of climate change over the next 30 years (Brown et al., 2012). \n', ' 150CHAPTER 6: ONTARIO\n 150\n(Source: Michigan Sea Grant) \n3.2 CLIMATE PROJECTIONS\nOntario™s climate is projected to change in all three sub-regions, with some variations.

Projected \n\nprecipitation changes show greater variability, with annual increases in all three sub-regions but \n\nseasonal (summer) decreases projected in Central and Southern Ontario under some scenarios. While \n\n\n\nthroughout the province (Cheng et al., 2012b).\n', ' 154CHAPTER 6: ONTARIO\n 154In Northern Ontario, snow as a proportion of winter precipitation is likely to decrease, and freezing \nrain events are expected to increase in frequency by 60-85 percent (Cheng et al., 2007). This creates \n\nthe potential for road, rail, and runway disruptions and safety issues in Northern Ontario. Warming \n\nand thawing of permafrost will most affect the hydrology of peatlands and surface stability in areas \n\nwhere permafrost is currently present (Prowse et al, 2009). Areas along the coast of James Bay and \n\nHudson Bay will experience earlier break-up and delayed freeze-up of sea ice, and will also continue \n\nto experience falling relative sea levels throughout this century and beyond, due to a phenomenon \n\nknown as ﬁisostatic reboundﬂ in which land previously depressed by glaciers rises gradually (Atkinson \n\net al., 2016).   \nFigure 6a: Precipitation changes for Ontario in summer (June - August) under RCP 2.5 (low-emissions \nscenario), RCP 4.5 (intermediate-emissions scenario), and RCP 8.5 (high-emissions scenario) for \n\n2046-2065, compared to baseline years 1986-2005. \n(Source: Environment and Climate Change \n\nCanada)', ' 155CHAPTER 6: ONTARIO\n 155Figure 6b: Precipitation changes for Ontario in winter (December - February) under RCP 2.5\n (low-emissions scenario), RCP 4.5 (intermediate-emissions scenario), and RCP 8.5 (high-emissions \nscenario) for 2046-2065, compared to baseline years 1986-2005. \n(Source: Environment and Climate \n\nChange Canada)Figures 6a and 6b demonstrate that under most scenarios, precipitation volumes will increase across \nthe province in winter, with more areas experiencing declining precipitation in the summer. In the \n\ncentral and southern sub-regions, the intensity, duration, and frequency of some extreme weather \n\nevents will likely increase in both summer and winter (Ontario Ministry of Transportation, 2013a; Chiotti \n\nand Lavender, 2008; Colombo et al., 2007; Deng et al., 2015). These events include ice storms, heat \n\nwaves, freezing rain (increasing 40 percent), and intense rainfall (Reid et al, 2007; Cheng et al., 2007). \n\nWhile annual snowfall volumes will likely decline under warmer winter conditions in the next few \n\ndecades, winter storms may increase in intensity (although decrease in frequency), yielding heavy \n\n\n\nToronto also suggests that while the season in which  freeze-thaw events occur (where temperatures \n\n\n\n\n\nAdministration, 2015).', ' 156CHAPTER 6: ONTARIO\n 156The Great Lakes greatly affect regional temperature and precipitation patterns (Gula and Peltier, \n2012). Warmer temperatures over the 21\nst century will likely be associated with a continued decrease \nin winter ice cover on the Great Lakes, consistent with observed trends (Kahl and Stirrat, 2012), and \n\nan increase in lake-effect snow in some locations. Increased temperatures (and evaporation) and \n\na longer ice-free season could lead to water-level decreases of 0.5-1 m in the Great Lakes and St. \n\nLawrence River by 2055 (Shlozberg et al, 2014; Brown et al., 2012). However, long-term future trends \n\ntoward lower water levels may be overestimated due to the limitations of traditional modeling \n\nefforts (MacKay and Seglenieks, 2013). As of February 2015, water levels in Lake Ontario and the St. \n\nLawrence Seaway were 20 cm below monthly historical averages (International St. Lawrence River \n\nBoard of Control, 2015).\n4.0 ROAD TRANSPORTATION IN ONTARIO \n4.1 PAST IMPACTS\nHistorical examples of climate impacts to transportation networks, particularly extreme weather \n\nevents, can affect public and political perceptions of risk and the likelihood of adaptation \n\naction. Major events that have affected transportation in Ontario include Hurricane Hazel in 1954 \n\n(Environment Canada, 2013b; see Chapter 9) and the North American Ice Storm of 1998. During the \n\n\n\ndamage and disruption, shut down transportation and signalization networks, and stranded travelers \n\n(Environment Canada, 2013b). \nIn December 2013, another severe winter weather event caused road obstructions throughout \nSouthern and Central Ontario, due to fallen branches, transmission lines, and heavy ice. The City of \n\nToronto (2014) estimates its municipal agencies incurred costs and lost revenue of approximately $106 \n\n\n\nevent, including the need to: Improve information-sharing between provincial and municipal governments; \n Enhance coordination between emergency personnel and the infrastructure sector;\n \n \n\nManagement, 2014).Recent extreme summer storm events have also caused widespread disruption and damage. In \n\n2002, Northwestern Ontario was struck by intense rain, resulting in $31 million in estimated damages to \n\nhighways, as well as lengthy closures to TransCanada highways (Chiotti and Lavender, 2008). Damage \n\nwould likely have been more severe had this storm occurred in a more urbanized area.  \nThe impacts of these events on connectivity are greater for regions dependent on roads and \nhighways with few alternate routes for mobility (such as in Central and Northern Ontario). Washouts \n\nfrom extreme weather events have stranded travelers for extended periods of time in some cases, \n\n\n', ' 157CHAPTER 6: ONTARIO\n 1574.2 FUTURE RISKS \nEXTREME AND CHANGING PRECIPITATION\nResearch suggests Southern Ontario is likely to experience more frequent and severe extreme \nweather events by late-century (Cheng et al., 2012a). Past impacts of heavy or prolonged \n\n\n\nin winter, have been disruptive to Ontario™s roads, bridges, and supporting infrastructure, and similar \n\noccurrences pose future risks. \nChanging patterns of precipitation will also likely affect Ontario™s roads. The province can expect \n\n\n(Boyle et al., 2013). Vehicle accidents are up to 45 percent more likely during severe precipitation \n\nevents (Andrey et al., 2003). Additionally, freezing rain (as a proportion of winter precipitation) is likely \n\nto increase throughout the province (Bruce, 2011; Cheng et al., 2011), creating safety and winter road \n\nmaintenance challenges (i.e. increased salt and sand requirements).\nRISING TEMPERATURES AND EXTREME HEAT\nRising annual temperatures and more frequent extreme heat events have increased instances of \n\n\n\nWoudsma et al., 2007). These impacts are likely to be exacerbated in the future considering projected \n\ntemperature trends (see Section 3). High temperatures causing thermal expansion of bridge joints \n\n(ﬁblow-upsﬂ) have also resulted in bridge closures and detours in some jurisdictions (Transportation \n\nResearch Board, 2008), although the risk of this impact remains low in Ontario.\nWarmer winter temperatures and more short-term (i.e. daily) temperature variability are likely to \nproduce more freeze-thaw cycles throughout the province, resulting in pavement deformation \n\nand shearing (Boyle et al., 2013; Ho and Gough, 2006). Resulting road damage could interrupt \n\neconomically important transportation activities, such as heavy-lift/special project cargo movement, \n\nlogging, and mining, affecting rural communities in Central and Northern Ontario.\nResearch suggests that while the impacts of climate change on pavement may be modest overall \nin Southern Ontario, changing conditions should be considered when selecting highway pavement \n\nmaterials (Tighe et al., 2008). For low-volume roads, research indicates that longitudinal cracking \n\nand rutting of pavement will worsen as a result of freeze-thaw cycles and extreme heat in the South, \n\nwhile transverse cracking will become less problematic (Mills et al., 2009). Roads will generally require \n\nmaintenance earlier in their life spans.Higher temperatures are likely to shorten operating seasons for winter roads in Central and Northern \nOntario. For instance, Deloitte (2014) projects that operating windows for winter roads serving \n\nOntario™s central and northern First Nations™ communities will decline 12 to 20 percent by 2050 from \n\npresent conditions, and 20 to 40 percent by 2100. Potential socioeconomic consequences include: \n A shorter seasonal window for the movement of freight and people (Deloitte, 2014); \n Higher maintenance costs (Boyle et al., 2013; Transportation Association of Canada, 2010);\n Reduced load capacity (due to decreased ice thickness) (Prowse et al, 2009); and, \n Road embankment failure (Transportation Association of Canada, 2010; Transportation Association \n\nof Canada, 2011).', ' 158CHAPTER 6: ONTARIO\n 158Warmer temperatures also provide some opportunities for Ontario™s roads, including:\n \n Longer construction seasons (Andrey and Mills, 2003); and,\n Reduced winter maintenance requirements (Fu et al., 2009).  \nCHANGING WATER LEVELS AND ICE PATTERNS\nFluctuating water levels and changing ice patterns in rivers and lakes may also result in roadway \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvulnerable areas over the long term (International Joint Commission, 2014a).\nWINDWind speeds throughout the province are projected to increase in coming years (Cheng et al., 2012b; \n\nEnvironment Canada, 2014), presenting risks to road transport. Strong winds disperse chemical road \n\ntreatments; produce drifting snow that reduces visibility, stability, and maneuverability; and damage \n\nsignals and other tall structures (OFCM, 2002).\n4.3 ADAPTATION PRACTICES\nPRECIPITATION AND FLOODING \n\nOntario™s roads.

These curves use Environment and Climate Change Canada™s most recent historical climate \n\ndata, and are available via an easy-to-use online platform.\n5 The MTO continues to partner with the \nUniversity of Waterloo to identify trends in the historical rainfall record, which can provide an alternative \nmethod of developing future scenarios.\nPROJECT 2:  ASSESSING HIGHWAY DRAINAGE AND STORMWATER MANAGEMENT \nINFRASTRUCTUREThis project assessed the resilience of existing highway drainage infrastructure to future precipitation loads, \n\nResearchers sampled two sections of provincial highway, representing different levels of use (Highway 37 \nnear Belleville and Highway 417 near Ottawa).

Changes to the range of experienced temperatures present challenges for the \n\nintegrity of rails Œ this risk is particularly pronounced in Southern Ontario where extreme temperatures \nwill be highest. For example, buckling may occur in extreme heat, increasing travel times (as a result \n\nof slower train speeds) and enhancing the potential for derailment, track-sensor malfunction, and \n\nhazardous-material spills (OFCM, 2002). High temperatures also result in overheated cargo (Andrey \n\nand Mills, 2003). In the North, permafrost thaw weakens rail embankments (Caldwell et al., 2002); in \n\ncombination with heavy precipitation, washouts and embankment failure may increase in Northern \nSUMMARY\nOverall, the results of this study are good news for Ontario highways. It was concluded that MTO™s existing \ndesign standards for highways are resilient to overtopping within the projected range of precipitation, and \n\n\ncapacity were sized to meet regulatory minimums, rather than to deal with expected rainfall levels. Thus, \nno infrastructure should need replacing before the end of its lifecycle to account for rainfall increases.\nThis analysis was limited to possible climate change impacts on the rainfall intensities used in design. Areas \nthat could be considered in future include the impacts of increasing precipitation intensity and duration on \n\nthe Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry).\n\nrare occurrences that exceed design capacity. The impact of such disruptions to roads may be reduced \nvia redundancies in the road network (i.e. alternative routes on nearby municipal roads). (See Chapter 9.) \n\n–', ' 163CHAPTER 6: ONTARIO\n 163Ontario (Transportation Association of Canada, 2010). However, warmer winters could reduce cold-\nweather rail maintenance for Ontario™s railways (Andrey et al, 2003).\nWind also poses risks to rail transportation, such as more schedule disruptions and delays; hazardous \nmaterial spills; railcar blow-over (albeit only during extremely rare events); and disruptions and \n\ndamage to signalization equipment (OFCM, 2002). Given increasing daily average wind speeds \n\nthroughout the province (see Section 3), these risks may increase in the 21\nst century.\n\nand reduce on-time performance (Woudsma et al, 2007; OFCM 2002; Koatse and Rietveld, 2012). \n\n\n\nchanging patterns of lake ice (Koatse and Rietveld, 2012). \n5.3 ADAPTATION PRACTICES\nA number of practices to reduce rail vulnerabilities exist in the literature. In the case of extreme heat \n\nand rail buckling, approaches include imposing speed restrictions, reducing service frequency, and \n\nconducting more frequent track inspections (Savonis et al., 2008). Cargo cooling and refrigeration \n\nmay reduce product loss and damage for freight carriers (Andrey and Mills, 2003). Researchers have \n\nalso reported reductions in peak rail temperature by using low-solar absorption rail coatings in sunny \n\nconditions (Wang et al., 2015). GO Transit has changed its engineering practices to reduce the \n\nvulnerability of its rail to extreme heat (Case study 2).\n\n\n\nsolutions (Savonis et al, 2008), and elevating track segments (Koatse and Rietveld, 2012). During \n\nextreme precipitation events, rail providers may reduce service frequency and increase the timeliness \n\n\n\nconditions (OFCM, 2002). For example, following various extreme events in the Greater Toronto \n\nArea, Metrolinx and GO Transit undertook a number of adaptive measures to enhance rail-corridor \n\nresiliency, including:\n Flood-prevention efforts in the Don Valley, installing rail embankment-failure and high-water \n\ndetectors; \n Service-planning for extreme winter weather (which involves running fewer trains, but reduces the \n\nlikelihood of delays or cancellations, to ensure business continuity in snowy conditions); and \n The installation of emergency electricity backup at their rail maintenance facility.\nTable 4 provides an overview of the impacts and adaptations discussed in this section.\n', ' 164CHAPTER 6: ONTARIO\n 164Table 4: Climate risk factors discussed in relation to their impacts on rail transportation. \nCitations for these impacts and adaptations are located in Section 5.\nClimate / environmental\n risk factors:Impacts and opportunitiesAdaptation actionsWarmer air \ntemperature (summer \nand winter; more \nvariability) Increase in rail buckling events leading \nto greater potential for derailment and \n\ntrack-sensor malfunction; increased travel \ntime/lesser speed; increased risk of hazard \nmaterial spills Overheating of cargo/signalization \n\nequipment Overall reduction in cold-weather rail \n\nmaintenance requirements (opportunity)\n Speed restrictions, service \n\nfrequency reductions; air \n\nconditioning for signal \nequipment; inspect tracks \nmore frequently; more \n\ntimely service advisories and \n\nupdates \n Cargo cooling/refrigeration\nPrecipitation \n(changing seasonal patterns, increasing \nintensity and extremes)\n Flooded; service disruptions and delays; \n\nreduced on-time performance during \n\nextreme events \n Flood-prevention engineering \n\nsolutions; increasing travel \n\n\noperations for forecasted \nconditions Embankment-failure and \n\nhigh-water detector \n\ninstallation \n Elevation of trackWind (changes in \naverage wind speeds and extremes)\n Increased schedule disruptions and delays\n Increased risk of hazardous material spills\n Railcar blow-over Disruptions to signaling equipment \n\nthe literature for this category\nChanging water levels (lakes, rivers, ocean)  Flooding of rails near watercourses\n \n\nmanagement improvements \n', ' 165CHAPTER 6: ONTARIO\n 165CASE STUDY 2: PREPARING FOR HIGHER TEMPERATURES AND \nRAIL BUCKLING AT GO TRANSIT\nMetrolinx is a provincial agency responsible for public transportation in the Greater Toronto and \nHamilton Area (GTHA). Its authority extends to capital investments, strategic decision-making, and \n\noperational planning for GO Transit (Canada™s highest-volume commuter rail and bus service), as well \nas improving, coordinating, and integrating these services with municipal transit and other modes. \nMetrolinx and GO Transit have begun to broadly identify threats to the organisation posed by changes \n\nin climate and extreme weather events, and to assess vulnerabilities and risks to facilities, practices, \n\nand protocols. A corporate climate adaptation policy is also being developed, due to be completed \nin 2018 (Metrolinx, 2015).\nIn the near-term, the organisation is responding to the most immediate climate-related concerns with \navailable resources and expertise. These ﬁlow-hanging fruitﬂ mainly fall under the operational umbrella, \n\nsince disruptions to front-line services and road and rail infrastructure pose risks to the quantity and quality \nof commuter service Metrolinx is able to provide. \nFor instance, the Railway Corridors division of GO Transit is preparing for the extreme summer temperatures \nprojected for Southern Ontario by the middle of the 21\nst century. There is a tendency for rail lines to expand \n\n\ncapacity. Minor buckling has been observed along select network segments on hot summer days over \nthe past 10 years. GO engineers have opted to proactively lessen buckling risks to rail lines and service by \n\n\n\n\n\nareas since this change was made. While no organisational standards have been changed (largely due to \nthe time and resources required) the practice has been adopted beyond Railway Corridors.

Events affecting one airport can also have a ripple \n\neffect, disrupting air travel in other parts of Canada and North America.  \nFor example, from January 5 to 9, 2014, an unusual combination of rain, snow, snow squalls, and wind \nchills/extreme cold in Eastern Ontario and other parts of Canada severely disrupted passenger travel \n\nat many airports, including Toronto Pearson International. Extreme cold (reaching -39°C with wind \n\nchill) and ice build-up slowed ground crews and caused some equipment (e.g., fueling) to fail or \n\noperate intermittently. The sudden drop in temperature also caused snow and slush, from earlier rain, \n\non taxiways, apron, and gate areas to freeze. Temperatures were too cold for chemical treatments \n\nto effectively melt the ice and snow. These operational impacts in tandem with other factors (such \n\n\n\ndisruptions in passenger travel throughout Canada. In response to this event, the Greater Toronto \n\nAirports Authority (GTAA) reviewed and developed recommendations on the airport™s operations, \n\ncustomer service, and communications (GTAA, 2014a).\n6.2 FUTURE RISKSLiterature suggests air transportation is affected by a changing climate and extreme weather in \n\nseveral ways. The following climate risks are relevant to airports and aviation in Ontario.\n More variable temperatures increase the risk of ice build-up on wings (GTAA, 2014b).  \n Warmer conditions result in decreased air density, which provides less lift for aircraft. This can \n\nincrease requirements for fuel and runway length (Andrey and Mills, 2003). \n Increased freeze-thaw cycles can cause runway buckling (Transportation Research Board, 2008). \n Extreme cold and heat can affect airplane engines and airport operations, resulting in service \n\ndelays and reduced on-time performance (OFCM, 2002; Woudsma et al, 2007). \n Thawing permafrost poses a risk to the stability of runways in northern communities dependent \n\nupon aviation (Transportation Association of Canada, 2010).\n \n\nevents and seasonal changes in water levels (Andrey and Mills, 2003; ICAO Secretariat, 2010). \n Greater wind intensity (both daily and during extreme events) increase incidences of foreign \n\nobjects on runways, taxiways, and maintenance facilities, and impede maintenance of airplanes \n\n(especially high on the body, including snow removal and de-icing procedures) (OFCM, 2002). \n Warming temperatures will also lead to more ﬁmixedﬂ precipitation events (for instance, freezing \n\nrain combined with snow and rain) during winter operations (GTAA, 2014b). \n\n\nrerouted, further straining infrastructure and operations.\n', ' 167CHAPTER 6: ONTARIO\n 1676.3 ADAPTATION PRACTICES\nWhile air operators in Ontario are already applying some adaptive practices, others could be applied \nunder future conditions. For example, remote airports\n in Northern Ontario\n have long used portable \nforced air heaters to combat ice build-up on aircraft\n (Transport Canada, 2004). To cope with a \nprojected increase in extreme winter weather and freezing rain\n events, operators could also adopt \nchanges to engine and wing de-icing procedures in future. This could include a greater use of glycol-\nbased de-icing and anti-icing agents (Transportation Research Board, 2011).  \n\nsuch as by reducing de-icing requirements in southern locations (Andrey and Mills, 2003). As \n\ntemperatures increase, however, airports may use more heat-resistant pavement materials for \n\nrunway construction (similar to asphalt roads) (Andrey and Mills, 2003). Over the longer term, future \n\ntemperatures may need to be considered when determining runway length requirements. \nTo enhance the braking and handling ability of aircraft on wet surfaces during periods of heavy \nprecipitation, Ottawa International Airport grooved one of its runways in the summer of 2013. \n\nGrooving minimizes the potential for hydroplaning when landing, and construction is relatively non-\n\ndisruptive. (The runway remained in use during the day while construction was completed over ten \n\nnights).  After a year of operating on this new surface, pilots reported improved control.  The airport \n\nthen moved forward with plans to groove its longest runway in the summer of 2015 (Schwanz, 2014).  \nRunways experiencing issues associated with permafrost thaw are common in Northern Canada \n(Transportation Association of Canada, 2010) (see Chapter 3), although these issues were not \n\n\n\ninclude relocating damaged or unusable infrastructure or reconstruction with geosynthetic barriers to \n\nenhance stability (Savonis et al., 2008; Transportation Association of Canada, 2010). Thermosyphons Œ \n\nmechanical systems designed to transfer heat from the ground away from infrastructure Œ also reduce \n\nthe impacts of thawing permafrost on runways, although the installation costs may be prohibitive for \n\nsmall airports (Transportation Association of Canada, 2010). \n\nTable 5: Climate risk factors discussed in relation to their impacts on air transportation. \nClimate /environmental\n risk factors:Adaptation actionsWarmer air temperature \n(summer and winter; more \nvariability)- More runway length and fuel \nrequired due to decreased air \n\ndensity- Delays due to extreme cold and \n\nheat (impacts to engines)- Runway buckling- Consideration of future temperature \n\nwhen determining runway length \n\nrequirements\n- Change to engine and wing de-\nicing procedures (reduced de-icing) \n- Heat-resistant pavement material \n\nselection Precipitation (changing \nseasonal patterns, \nincreasing intensity and \nextremes)\n- Service disruptions and delays; \nreduced on-time performance\n- Runway grooving to enhance \n\naircraft braking and handling; \n\nreduces risk of hydroplaning \nChanging patterns of lake \nand sea ice- \n\nvulnerable locations - Improvements in stormwater \n\nmanagement infrastructure\n', ' 168CHAPTER 6: ONTARIO\n 168Climate /environmental\n risk factors:Adaptation actionsWind (changes in average \nwind speeds and extremes)\n- Increased incidence of foreign \nobjects present on runways, \n\ntaxiways, and maintenance facilities- Maintenance of airplanes  (especially high on the body) \nimpeded- Impeded snow removal/de-icing \n\nprocedures\n- \nChanges in water levels (lakes, rivers, ocean) and patterns of lake and sea \nice- Inundation of airport facilities- \n\nfacilities Permafrost degradation\n- Runway stability issues- Use of geotextiles for reinforcement; \n\nthermosyphons for ground cooling\nCASE STUDY 3: ASSESSING THE VULNERABILITY OF \nSTORMWATER MANAGEMENT INFRASTRUCTURE AT PEARSON \n\nINTERNATIONAL AIRPORT\nIn 2012, the Greater Toronto Airports Authority (GTAA) assessed the vulnerability of selected stormwater \ninfrastructure at Toronto Pearson International Airport to climate change, using Engineers Canada™s Public \n\nInfrastructure Engineering Vulnerability Committee™s (PIEVC) Climate Vulnerability Assessment process. \n\n\n\ninclude: \n Flooding of runways, taxiways, and manoeuvring areas; \n Wind damage to terminals and navigational equipment; \n Stormwater runoff exceeding drainage capacity; \n Disruption of operations and ground access; and \n Changing requirements for plane de-icing and snow removal. \nThe PIEVC protocol gives infrastructure operators a method to assess the vulnerability of their assets in \n\n\nStage 1\nSpring Creek Triple Box Culvert (see Figure 7).

According to this assessment, the risk-probabilities of 90 per cent of climate-infrastructure \n\ninteractions did not increase from current to projected climate conditions.

As a bond-issuing entity, the GTAA has a responsibility to make investors aware of issues \n\nthat might affect investment decisions, including climate risks. Challenges the GTAA faced when applying \n\nthe PIEVC protocol included:\n Maintaining consistency and continuity in staff responsible for carrying out the assessment; \n Time- and cost-overruns of approximately 30 percent due to reorganization. \n Ensuring organization-wide buy-in. \nStaff suggested that while baseline climate data were somewhat outdated (only historical data for the \n\nperiod 1971-2000 was available; climate normals from 1981-2010 had not yet been released), there was a \n\nconsensus that more recent data would have shifted trends included in the vulnerability assessment only \n\nincrementally.\nOverall, the GTAA™s PIEVC assessment has raised awareness and understanding of climate risks among \noperators and shareholders alike. Since the project assessed only $90 million of Pearson™s $6-7 billion in \n\nassets, the organization is now developing a streamlined process based on the PIEVC model to apply to \n\nother infrastructure more rapidly, at a lower cost, and at an appropriate level of detail.\n\n–Figure 7: Spring Creek Triple Box Culvert at \nPearson Airport.

The damage, which most affected Lakes Huron, Erie and Ontario, \n\nwas estimated at $5 million ($119.3 million in 2015 dollars) (Brown, 2002). The nature of Great Lakes \n\nnavigation during this period increased the risk of ships capsizing, as boats were constructed with \n\nthe narrow width of the St. Lawrence Seaway and the shallow depth of many Great Lakes tributaries \n\nin mind (Catton, 1984). The storm catalyzed boat-hatch and other safety requirements, and ship-\n\n\n\nduring high-intensity events (Catton, 1984). \nLow water levels in the Great Lakes have also negatively affected shippers in the past. In 1964, lower-\nthan-normal water levels damaged harbor infrastructure, requiring $843 million in repairs (in 1988 \n\ndollars, or $1.49 billion in 2015 dollars) (Shlozberg et al., 2014). \n7.2 FUTURE RISKSThroughout the 21\nst\nevaporation, a longer ice-free season, and changing precipitation patterns. These changes will \n\n\n\naffected vessel draft capacities and annual shipping volumes throughout the Great Lakes system. \n\nA continuation of this trend would reduce the loads ships can carry (or produce greater variation in \n\nseasonal shipping capacity), increase costs, lead to more frequent shipping-schedule disruptions, \n\nand reduce shoreline access (Boyle et al., 2013; Shlozberg et al, 2014). Economic losses would be \n\n\n\n$1.18 billion by 2030 and $1.92 billion by 2050 as a result of reduced shipping productivity in low-water \n\nconditions (Shlozberg et al, 2014). While low water levels are not unprecedented Œ the 1960s also \n\nfeatured below-average levels in many lakes (Dorling and Hanniman, 2016) Œ the potential for far-\n\nreaching economic impacts make this a key concern for Ontario™s economy. \nFluctuations in water levels also affect infrastructure stability, requiring additional dredging of harbour \n\n\nimplications. Low water levels can also cause infrastructure decay, as wooden structural elements \n\nbecome increasingly exposed to oxygen (Clark, 2012). Ontario has experienced these issues: low water \n\nlevels in 2013 caused problems at docks in Tobermory and South Baymouth on Georgian Bay, when \n\nferries sat too low for the fenders (designed to prevent vessels from damaging wharves). Ferry services \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfrom more freezing rain and extreme weather events may increase ice-scour damage on dock \n\nstructures and visual navigational aids during winter (OFCM, 2002). \nPractitioners also suggest that ﬁseasonal shiftﬂ of the navigable period is another important issue \nfor shippers in the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Seaway, pushing traditional construction and \n\nmaintenance schedules out of alignment with operational demands. For instance, extended or year-\nround shipping in the Great Lakes would shorten or eliminate the ﬁlay-upﬂ period for operators in the \n\n\n', ' 171CHAPTER 6: ONTARIO\n 171\n\n\nLakes. For instance, a recent Seiche event in Lake Michigan changed water levels by more than 3 \n\n\n\nvessels and infrastructure (International Joint Commission, 2014a). \nThe changing climate also creates opportunities for the marine transportation sector. These include: \n \nthe central and northern sub-regions in Ontario); \n A longer spring and summer shipping season; \n Less ice accumulation on vessels and rigging (Transportation Research Board, 2008); and, \n Possible new shipping routes (including the potential opening of shipping routes through the \n\nArctic, although these face limitations Œ see Section 2.4) (Prowse et al, 2009).\n7.3 ADAPTATION PRACTICES\n\n\nwater levels affect navigability, shippers may shift freight to road or rail (Savonis et al., 2008). Other \n\n\n\naugmentation technologies; and increasing dredging of channels (Andrey and Mills, 2003). The St. \n\nLawrence Seaway Management Corporation (SLSMC) is taking an adaptive management approach \n\nto changes in climate, which includes monitoring water levels and ice patterns (see Case study 4).  \n\nCommercial shippers operating in the Great Lakes also possess a degree of adaptive capacity and \n\n\n\nbefore arriving in Canadian waters (for international transits). \n\nfound that the most cost-effective solution involves constructing a series of sills, or speed bump-\n\n\n\n\nPlan 2014, \n\nCommission (2014b), aims to reduce damages for property owners, including ports and harbours by \n\ncontrolling the possible range of water levels. Largely, these planning initiatives attempt to reduce the \n\nrisks associated with uncertain future water levels (International Joint Commission, 2014b; Dorling and \n\nHanniman, 2016).E-Navigation (electronic navigation) refers to modern navigation technologies and services that may \nhelp operators adapt to periods of lower water levels in Ontario. Potential improvements to these \n\nsystems include establishing internet connections to provide basic ship-to-shore communication \n\nchannels along navigable waterways. Modern ﬁunder-keel optimization systemsﬂ have also been \n\nimplemented in some locations between Quebec City and Montreal along the St. Lawrence Seaway \n\n(Canadian Coast Guard, 2015), allowing operators to adjust speed (and draft) in order to pass \n\n\n\nThis system has also been proposed for parts of the Seaway passing through Ontario, including the St \n\nClair-Detroit River, and the St. Mary™s River. \n\nof ice-breaking vessels. Practitioners in Ontario suggest that the past two winters have demonstrated \n\n\n\n\n\ninfrastructure (i.e. breakwaters and dikes) may be prudent (Savonis et al., 2008).\n', ' 172CHAPTER 6: ONTARIO\n 172In some parts of the province, ice blowing into locks delays the opening of the navigation season. This \nimpact may be reduced by using ice curtains (which restrict ice moving into locks) and air bubblers \n\n(including compressors and fuel). However, as ice cover decreases throughout the 21\nst century, issues \nposed by ice breakup should become less problematic for operators. \nTable 6\n \nTable 6: Climate risk factors discussed in relation to their impacts on marine transportation. \nClimate/environmental  \nrisk factors:Adaptation actionsWarmer air temperature \n(summer and winter; more variability)\n Lower water levels on fresh-water \nnavigable watercourses (i.e. \n\nGreat Lakes), leading to increased \ncosts/more trips\n Reduced ice accumulation on \nvessels and rigging (opportunity) Longer shipping season due \n\nto longer ice-free period \n\n(opportunity) Changes to navigation \n\nprocedures; channel dredging; \n\n\nPrecipitation (changing \nseasonal patterns, \nincreasing intensity and \nextremes)\n Disruption to shipping schedules  Seasonal shift in shipping practices Flow management improvements \nChanging patterns of lake \nand sea ice Increased shipping hazards due \n\nto longer period of ice pack \n\nweakness (ex. increased wave \naction, storm surge, etc.)\n Lengthened summer shipping \nseason, emergence of new \n\nshipping routes (opportunity)\n \n\nplanes (opportunity) Greater investment in ice-\n\nmanagement equipment and \n\nresources\nWind (changes in \naverage wind speeds and extremes)\n \n\nfrom sustained winds (Shlozberg et \n\nal, 2014) \n\nhandling \n\nliterature\n \n\nliterature\nChanges in water levels (lakes, rivers, ocean)   Decreased shipping capacity in \n\nGLSLS; more frequently-restricted \n\nchannels \n\nmarine infrastructure\n \n\ndamage from storm surges\n \n\ninfrastructure\n Modal shift of freight to road, rail, \n\nand air E-Nav and ﬁunder-keel \n\noptimizationﬂ technologies Increased dredging of channels \n \n\ntechnologies (i.e. breakwaters \n\nand dikes)', ' 173CHAPTER 6: ONTARIO\n 173CASE STUDY 4: WATER LEVELS, ICE REMOVAL, AND ADAPTIVE \nMANAGEMENT AT THE ST. LAWRENCE SEAWAY MANAGEMENT \n\nCORPORATION\n\nSt. Lawrence Seaway. The Seaway is an important international marine shipping route spanning 3,700 km \n\nover many jurisdictions. Critical stretches include the Welland Canal (connecting Lakes Ontario and Erie) \n\nand the segment from Lake Ontario to Montreal. The St. Lawrence Seaway Management Corporation \n\n(SLSMC) is \n\n\n13 of the waterway™s 15 locks.There is much uncertainty regarding water levels throughout the Seaway, as they tend to vary year-to-\nyear. Some studies suggest lower water levels will be the norm through the 21\nst century (Shlozberg et al., \n\n\n(MacKay and Seglenieks, 2013). Either way, strategies to deal with uncertainty are recommended.  For \n\n\n\nthat can be moved. Andrey et al. (2014) suggests that for each centimetre of water lost, the capacity of \nan average ship decreases by six containers (60 tons). \n\noperators in the Seaway, including the SLSMC. Ice build-up delays seasonal opening and increases \n\n\n\n\n\nadaptive procedures in light of observed and projected impacts.\nFor instance, the SLSMC collects extensive climate data to determine how environmental conditions will \naffect infrastructure performance over the short and long term. It also monitors water levels, temperature \n\nand wind conditions, and ice patterns. The organization uses this data to predict seasonal Seaway opening \n\nand closing dates, secure requisite ice-breaking services and assets, and rent an appropriate volume of \n\nice-management equipment for channels and locks. \nHowever, practitioners have observed increased variability in weather along the Seaway in recent years, \n\n\nprocesses. During the navigation season, the SLSMC has procedures to deal with extreme (short-term) \n\nevents, including wind causing low water levels. These include: \n Suspending navigation and temporarily redirecting vulnerable vessels to safe anchorage areas until \n\nconditions become acceptable again. \n \n Restricting speed and draft to reduce navigational risks (i.e. striking bottom).  \nReduced maximum permissible shipping draft\n6 is an especially problematic impact of declining water \n\n\nthe supply chain. To increase safety for deep-draft vessels, many vessels have installed onboard Draft \n\nInformation Systems. This software application provides graphical representations of the anticipated under-\n\nkeel conditions for a vessel given its position, speed, and heading in relation to surrounding water levels \n\nand bathymetry. The system allows vessels to take proactive, draft-altering measures to ensure safe transit \n\nby adjusting speeds. In 2014, 39 inland commercial ships used this application in the Seaway, though there \n\nis potential for greater uptake.\nIce is another major consideration for the SLSMC, and caused delays opening the Montreal-Lake Ontario \n\n6  Draft refers to the vertical distance between the waterline and the bottom of a ship™s hull. This affects the \n depth of a ship in the water.\nCASE STUDY 4–', ' 174CHAPTER 6: ONTARIO\n 1748.0 A MULTI-MODAL APPROACH TO TRANSPORTATION AND ADAPTATION\nA changing climate will affect Central and Northern Ontario differently than the South, and \nadaptive capacity varies considerably among municipalities within these sub-regions. Compared \n\nto the South, these two sub-regions encompass a larger area, and have fewer data and resources \n\navailable to support adaptive decision-making for transportation (Chiotti and Lavender, 2008). The \n\nprovincial government has taken steps to determine appropriate climate adaptation strategies for \n\ntransportation in these regions, and has initiated a multimodal study of Ontario™s ﬁnear northﬂ and \n\nﬁfar northﬂ (approximating the central and northern sub-regions) (Caroline De Groot, Ministry of \n\nTransportation of Ontario, personal communication, 2015). \nThis study will identify short-, medium-, and long-term improvements for all modes of transportation. \nIt will also provide transportation users and service-providers with tangible adaptation solutions and \n\ndecision-makers with a foundation for action, by identifying: \n\nof climate change (i.e. shorter winter-road access seasons); \n Possible effects of climate change on Northern Ontario™s construction, operations, and \n\nmaintenance standards for roads, railways, airports, and marine infrastructure; and, \n Best-practice alternatives and strategic directions to address the challenges mentioned above.\ndepends heavily on coordination with the Canadian and U.S. Coast Guards for support from their ice-\nbreaking vessels. The SLSMC also contracts tugboats with scrapers and excavators for ice management \n\nwhen needed. \nIce does not typically delay opening of the Welland Canal. However, at the beginning of the 2014 season, \nships travelling through the passage from St. Catharines to Port Colborne had nowhere to go because of \n\nice on Lakes Erie, Superior, and Huron. Ice was also blown into locks, causing temporary delays.  \n\nmore severe conditions overall. Ice curtains and air bubblers are used to keep locks free from ice where \n\nand when it is feasible to do so. Increasing ice-management capacity has proven useful for adapting to \n\nchanging patterns of winter weather extremes, but may become less costly as winters gradually warm \n\nthroughout the Seaway.\n\n–', ' 175CHAPTER 6: ONTARIO\n 1759.0 KNOWLEDGE GAPS AND CONSTRAINTS TO ADAPTIVE DECISION-MAKING IN ONTARIO \nDespite progress on a number of initiatives in the province, barriers to adaptation in the transportation \nsector persist. Limited resources and expertise can be are obstacles to developing and implementing \n\nmeaningful adaptation strategies, particularly in Central and Northern Ontario. \nThe cumulative impacts of climate change on transportation infrastructure, referring to two or more \n\n\n\n\nthresholds, creating destructive lifting and shearing forces on highways, bridges, locks, and harbours, with \n\npotentially costly and damaging effects. While concrete examples of these impacts are lacking in Ontario, \n\nrecent winter storm events in the United States and United Kingdom suggest that infrastructure damage \n\n\nTreating adaptation as an issue separate from other aspects of transportation is an additional \nconstraint.  Communities and practitioners in Canada have not yet integrated adaptation goals into \n\nmuch of their transportation planning and decision-making (Newman et al., 2013; Henstra, 2015). \n\nSome initiatives in Ontario, such as those highlighted in case studies, represent noteworthy exceptions. \nConstraints also exist within the climate science and adaptation community, the transportation sector \n\n\n\n\ndetermine appropriate adaptation options. Engineers Canada (2012) also argues that a lack of \n\n\n\nadaptive infrastructure over cheaper infrastructure, which is typically designed for historic climate \n\npressures (often with the use of outdated data). Remedies to this situation include maintaining and \n\ndeveloping more robust historical records and climate modeling processes, and training engineers in \n\ndealing effectively with climate uncertainty. \nA further challenge is the traditional complexity of the freight system and different jurisdictional \nresponsibilities. Considering the range of actors and agencies at play in international road freight \n\n\n10.0 CONCLUSIONSOntario faces diverse and potentially costly risks associated with changing climate conditions \n\nand evolving transportation requirements. While Ontario™s adaptive capacity is generally high, \n\nvulnerabilities to extreme weather and gradual changes in climate present challenges to \n\ntransportation decision-makers and infrastructure operators. \nThe adaptation practices described in this chapter speak to the willingness of decision makers to \n\n\noperations. The challenge at all levels is to provide coordinated, timely, and effective responses to \n\nthese risks. \n', ' 176CHAPTER 6: ONTARIO\n 176REFERENCESAboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada.

Climate change will affect the natural environment of all regions of Quebec and may damage or \ncause service interruptions to transportation systems. Nunavik has, and will continue to, experience \n\n\ntransportation infrastructure is built. In eastern Quebec, the increase in relative sea level, loss of ice \n\ncover, freeze-thaw cycles and changes to storm systems will contribute to further erosion of riverbanks \n\nand shorelines. For all regions of Quebec, Surface runoff management is a challenge.\n The vulnerability of transportation systems to climate change varies according to regional \n\ncharacteristics, the type of infrastructure and its use. \nThe condition and maintenance of \ninfrastructure, the current use of transportation systems and the availability of alternatives during \n\n\n\ntransportation systems. Extreme weather events represent one of the greatest risks for the transportation sector, in all \n\nthe regions of Quebec. \n\n\nboth the transportation infrastructure and the mobility of people and goods. The isolation of \ncommunities that depend more on one particular mode of transportation could be accentuated \nby extreme weather events.\n \n\nnorthern communities, similar to the northern territories, rising temperatures are also reducing winter \n\nmobility due to shorter freezing periods.   \nThe shorter winter season and loss of ice cover make access \n\n Climate change adaptation issues represent significant social, institutional, environmental \n\nand economic challenges. Success stories in this area are the result of multisectoral initiatives, \n\ninvolving players from the public and private sectors and civil society, and their inclusion in \n\nexisting planning efforts. \n Acquiring data to monitor the condition of infrastructure and efforts to search for effective \n\nsolutions for transportation systems are key means of adapting to the inevitable changes. \n\nAdaptation options will affect both the design and management practices for the operation and \n\nmaintenance of infrastructure.  Analysing the potential performance of these options depends on \n\na solid knowledge of the transportation systems and the environment in which they operate.\n', ' 184CHAPTER 7: QUEBEC 1841.0 INTRODUCTIONIn Quebec, transportation plays a major role in supporting the vitality of regions, the distribution of \ngoods and services, and the exploitation of natural resources. Most transportation infrastructure (road, \n\nrail, marine and air) was designed with a stable climate in mind, but climate change is affecting both \n\nthe lifespan and condition of the infrastructure. The size of the province, the remote nature of certain \n\nQuebec communities, and the limited redundancy of the transportation system,\n4 in the regions most \naffected by climate change, are also factors that increase its vulnerability.\nFor nearly 20 years, the Quebec government, carrier associations, expert panels, and companies \nhave been making greater efforts to adapt transportation systems to climate change and thus \n\nstrengthen its resilience. These efforts have enhanced knowledge about the impacts and potential \n\nsolutions to improve the management of transportation infrastructure. \nThis chapter describes the organization of transportation in Quebec by mode and by region, and \n\n\n\n1.1 REGIONAL PROFILE DEMOGRAPHICS AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC CONTEXTQuebec covers more than 1.6M km\n2 (Institut de la statistique du Québec, 2014) and has \napproximately 8,263,600 residents (Institut de la statistique du Québec, 2015; see Figure 1), making this \n\nprovince the second most populated in the country.  More than half (60%) of the Quebec population \nis concentrated in an area 10 km wide on either side of the St.\n Lawrence river (Institut de la statistique \ndu Québec, 2014). \n\npart of the province (Montréal, Québec City, Gatineau, Sherbrooke, Trois-Rivières). In other regions, \n\nthe population is more dispersed. For example, Nunavik makes up a little less than one-third of the \n\nterritory and has approximately 12,700 residents in 14 northern villages and the Cree community of \n\nWhapmagoostui.Population growth is expected in 13 of the 17 administrative regions of Quebec by 2061 (Girard, \nB-Charbonneau and F-Payeur, 2014). The regions which are expected to see this population growth \n\nwill be those supported by international migration (Montréal and Laval), inter-regional migration \n\n(Outaouais), internal migration (Laval, Lanaudière), and a rising fertility rate (Nunavik).\nAs shown in Table 1, the urban areas of the National Capital,\n5 Montréal, Montérégie, Laval and the \n\nand account for 67.4% of the Gross \nDomestic Product (GDP).\n The proximity of these areas to waterways and international transportation \ninfrastructure is vital to their success. Other regions depend more on the extraction of raw materials \nor tourism. The area of the gulf and estuary of the St. Lawrence is home to close to 5% of Quebec™s \npopulation and accounts for a similar share of the province™s economy (Beaulieu, 2014).\n4  The redundancy of a transportation system refers to the alternatives the system provides, ensuring additional routes and services \n\n\n5 Québec City region\n', ' 185CHAPTER 7: QUEBEC 185Table 1: Population distribution and economic activity by region. \n(Source: Soucy, 2015)\nAdministrative RegionPopulation (2014)Demographic Weight\nLand Area\nDensityEconomic Weight\nResidents KM2Res/KM201 Bas-Saint-Laurent\n200,2922.422,1549.02.002 Sagueneay-Lac-Saint-Jean277,7863.495,8702.93.203 Capitale-Nationale731,8388.918,66339.310.004 Mauricie266,7943.235,5317.52.505 Estrie320,0083.910,19331.43.206 Montréal1,988,24324.25003,992.534.607 Outaouais383,1824.730,33112.63.608 Abitibi-Témiscamingue147,8681.857,5502.62.109 Côté-Nord\n94,9061.2235,5820.42.310 Nord-du-Québec\n44,2560.5697,1520.10.911 Gaspésie-Îles-de-la-\nMadeleine92,4721.120,3274.60.812 Chaudlières-Appalaches\n419,7555.115,00127.84.213 Laval420,8705.12461,710.94.114 Lanaudière\n492,2346.012,29940.03.615 Laurentides\n586,0517.120,49028.55.416 Montérégie1,508,12718.411,141135.715.117 Centre-du-Québec\n239,9902.96,89934.72.6All of Quebec8,214,6721001,300,8156.31002.0 ORGANIZATION OF TRANSPORTATION IN QUEBEC\nThe transportation of goods and people in Quebec is multimodal and interconnected (CPCS, 2013). \nWhile trucking is the preferred mode for transporting goods; railways and waterways that connect the \n\nSt. Lawrence to the Great Lakes, also play an important role. Air transport, meanwhile, carries a lesser \n\nvolume of goods, but remains a strategic mode when delivery must be done quickly and the weight \n\nof the goods is not an issue (CPCS, 2013: 2-29).In Canada, the St. Lawrence is a key continental gateway. This multimodal axis of transportation is \nstrategic for the economy, demographics and geography of the country, making Quebec a hub \n\nfor the transportation of goods to other provinces and to the United States.\n The Quebec-Windsor \ncorridor concentrates approximately 80% of the activities of VIA Rail Canada (2014). The St. Lawrence \n\ndrainage basin, which includes the Great Lakes, is the largest drainage system in the world, draining \n\nmore than one quarter of the world™s fresh water reserves (Institut de la statistique du Québec, 2014). \nOther regions of Quebec are connected to the southern part of the province by strategic corridors \nthat allow for the exploitation of resources, such as forests, hydroelectricity and minerals. These regions \n\ndepend primarily on roads for the transportation of goods and people. There are also air connections \n\nfor each of these regions. The \nsize of the area and the dispersed population result in major challenges \nin planning and managing transportation networks (Ministère des Transports du Québec, 2013a).\n', ' 186CHAPTER 7: QUEBEC 186Finally, the 14 Inuit communities and the Cree community of Whapmagoostui in Nunavik are only \naccessible from the southern part of the province by air or sea, as are the Magdalen Islands and \n\ncertain communities located in the far eastern portion of the lower North Shore. \nIn Quebec, the planning, design, and management of transportation infrastructure; as well as \nconstruction, repair and maintenance work, are the responsibility of several institutional and private \n\npartners. Various Quebec government departments, public transportation agencies, public transit \n\nagencies, federal government departments and agencies, carrier associations, inter-municipal \n\ncouncils and municipal transportation agencies, local municipalities, regional county municipalities, \n\nmetropolitan communities and First Nations communities are all involved to varying degrees. \n\n(MTMDET)  plays a central role in the management and sharing of responsibilities for transportation \n\ninfrastructure. \nHighways; national, regional and collector roads; and some access roads to remote \nresources and communities fall under Quebec™s jurisdiction (Ministère des Transports du Québec, \n\n2015b). The MTMDET shares the management of these networks with carriers and private operators, \n\nas well as some local and regional authorities.\n6 The main railway networks are primarily under federal \njurisdiction, but are also under provincial jurisdiction (short lines), as well as under the responsibility \n\nof a dozen private organizations, or large railway companies such as Canadian National (CN) or \n\n\n\npublic and private stakeholders.Furthermore, the MTMDET produces manuals and guides to direct the design, management and \nmaintenance of transportation structures and systems. These manuals are used as the main reference \n\nguide by Quebec municipalities for roads under their responsibility. \nFigure 1 presents Quebec transportation infrastructure and shows the diversity of the main \ninfrastructure in Quebec and the many organizations that share in its management. \n6  The Société de développement de la Baie-James (SDBJ) for the James Bay road network owned by Hydro-Qué\n-bec, and the Kativik Regional Government for the Nunavik airports.\n', ' 187CHAPTER 7: QUEBEC 187Figure 1:  Map of principle transportation infrastructure in Quebec.\nThe Quebec-Ontario Continental Gateway and Trade Corridor initiative was undertaken jointly by the \nQuebec, Ontario and Canadian governments in 2007. It aimed to create an integrated multimodal \n\ntransportation system that was reliable, sustainable and competitive to support international trade. In \n\nthis respect, the St. Lawrence valley can be considered the main corridor in Quebec™s transportation \n\ninfrastructure network, and provides for much of the exchange between Quebec and its main \n\neconomic partners. It includes the major urban hubs of Montréal and Québec City. Figure 2 illustrates \n\nthis intermodality across Quebec.\n ', ' 188CHAPTER 7: QUEBEC 188Figure 2: Intermodal hubs in Quebec. \n(Source: Gouvernement du Québec, ministère des Transports, \n2013 (data from 2010))\n 2.1 ROAD TRANSPORTATION \n\npreferred mode for short-distance, inter-regional and inter-provincial transportation of goods and \n\npeople (Ministère des transports \ndu Québec, 2013b). In addition to ensuring access to much of \nQuebec, road infrastructure facilitates intermodal connections with rail terminals, ports and airports \n\n(CPCS, 2013).There are approximately 319,000 km of roads in Quebec, including highways, national roads, \ncollector roads, streets, bridges and overpasses, access roads and local roads (Ministère des \n\nTransports du Québec, 2015b; see Figure 3). There are also more than 300,000 kilometers of multi-use \n\nroads in forest settings. \nAging of infrastructure increases its vulnerability and maintenance costs. The average age of \ninfrastructure provides a means of evaluating the condition of the network and the need for investments \n\nto ensure its maintenance. Reinvestment in this area since the early 2000™s has reduced the average \nage of roads in Quebec from 18 years in 2000, to 13 years in 2009 (Gagné and Haarman, 2011).\n Certain regions are heavily dependent on a single road link for their regular supply and mobility \n\n\n\n\nAlthough user behaviour is often the cause of accidents, the contribution of weather conditions must \nalso be considered in road safety management (Andrey, 2010). Moreover, the number of collisions \n\nincreases during times of precipitation (Andrey and Mills, 2002). However, the number of road \n\naccidents has been on the decline since 2007, in Quebec and elsewhere in Canada.\n', ' 189CHAPTER 7: QUEBEC 189Some tourist regions such as the Gaspé, the Magdalen Islands, the North Shore and the lower St. \nLawrence have developed facilities and activities to promote the region and attract visitors. Theme \n\nroutes,\n7 such as the Route des baleines or the Route des Navigateurs, and national parks that draw on \ntheir relationship with the river (such as the Saguenay-St. Lawrence Marine Park and the Parc National \n\ndu Bic) are pillars of tourist development in these regions. Loss of access to these parks due to erosion \n\nof roads bordering the river would affect economic and social development. The same is true for \n\nthe Routes bleues, another theme route, and its related infrastructure, which are also affected by \n\nchanges observed along the St. Lawrence (coastal erosion, decreasing water levels, etc.). \n\nin the two metropolitan areas of Québec City and Montréal (MTQ, 2013a). Reduced speed due \n\nto congestion increases transit time as well as the cost of road transportation. It also reduces the \n\n\n\nwith the projected rise in summer temperatures and increased frequency, duration and intensity of \n\nheat waves, could also have important implications for road freight management systems in the \n\nfuture, particularly concerning new refrigeration requirements, choices of materials for pavement, \n\nand other factors. (Goodwin, 2004; James and James, 2010). \nFigure 3: Map of road transportation in Quebec. \n7 For more detailed information, visit \nhttp://www.sentiermaritime.ca/index.asp?id=522\n.', ' 190CHAPTER 7: QUEBEC 1902.2 MARINE TRANSPORTATION \nMarine transportation is closely tied to a number of key sectors of the Quebec economy, and plays a \nmajor role in the movement of goods along the St. Lawrence corridor. Marine transportation activity, \n\nincluding shipping, port and cruise tourism services, has been increasing in Quebec since 2000. In \n\n2011, these activities represented sales of more than $2.3 billion. \nPorts along the St. Lawrence primarily move mineral ore, forestry products, agricultural and food \nproducts, manufactured goods, fuel and chemical products, and machinery (St.\n Lawrence Economic \nDevelopment Council, 2015), in addition to supplying industries and communities (see Figure 2). \nNunavik, the coastal communities in the Eeyou-Istchee James Bay region and several municipalities \nalong the North Shore are also equipped with marine infrastructure consisting of breakwaters, access \n\n\n\nis the main supply link for remote communities. Some larger marine infrastructure serves industrial \n\nactivity in these same regions. For example, a private deep-water wharf at Baie Déception in Nunavik \n\nserves a mining operation, and other private industrial dock projects could be developed in the \n\nregion with increased mining activity.\nThe main commercial ports in Quebec include the ports under the jurisdiction of Canadian port \nauthorities in Montréal, Trois-Rivières, Québec City, Saguenay and Sept-Îles. Other ports and marine \n\ninfrastructure play an important role in supporting recreational tourism activities and other local needs.\nThe port network in Quebec handled 130.4 million tonnes of goods in 2011, three quarters which \nwere international goods (Statistics Canada, 2011). The Port of Montréal is the largest container port \n\nin eastern Canada (Port of Montreal, 2015), receiving more than one million 20-foot equivalent unit \n\ncontainers annually. Playing a pivotal role in the transportation of goods, it is directly connected to rail \n\nand road networks. Each week 80 trains pass through the port, with 5,000 trucks arriving and leaving \n\neach day (Port of Montreal, 2015). The ports of Sept-Îles-Pointe-Noire, Port-Cartier, Baie-Comeau and \n\nHavreSaintPierre on the North Shore are among the ten largest ports in Quebec in terms of tonnage \n\nof goods handled (Ministère de l™Énergie et des Ressources Naturelles, 2011). The deep water port in \n\nQuébec City that specializes in transshipment serves as a true intermodal hub for trade in the Great \n\nLakes Œ St. Lawrence River corridor. The port in Sept-Îles is the third largest port in Canada in terms of \nbulk tonnage handled. \nFerries managed by the Société des traversiers du Québec are linked to the land transportation \nsystem to enhance people™s mobility. In some urban areas, connections to public transportation \n\nnetworks also facilitate intra-regional and inter-regional travel. Ferry activity, however, is subject to \n\n\n\nimpact of climate change. On the St. Lawrence, 18 ferries operate year-round and serve more than \n\n2.3 RAIL TRANSPORTATION \nThe Quebec rail network mainly follows the St. Lawrence valley and extends to the north of the \n\nprovince toward regions of Abitibi-Témiscamingue, Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean and Chibougamau, the \n\nNorth Shore, and Labrador (see Figure 2). Among other services, it transports intermodal containers \n\nfor forestry products, mining products and aluminum. A large number of rail cars run through the \n\nMontréal and Québec City regions on their way to other Canadian provinces and the United States \n(Ministère des Transports du Québec, 2008).\nSeveral rail freight service companies serve Quebec. The largest are Canadian National (CN), \n\n\nnetwork in Quebec. A few manufacturing or resource extraction companies, such as Arcelor Mittal or \n\nRio Tinto Alcan, also operate some of the province™s railway lines. With a few exceptions, railways with \n', ' 191CHAPTER 7: QUEBEC 191tracks extending outside of Quebec are under federal jurisdiction, whereas all other tracks are under \nprovincial jurisdiction. Transportation of people is primarily provided by Via Rail Canada Inc., but also \n\nby the Québec North Shore and Labrador Railway, by Amtrak for sections in the southernmost part of \n\nthe province that lead to the United States, and by commuter trains and tourist trains. \nDemand for rail services has increased somewhat since 2001, both for the transportation of goods and \ntravelers (Réseau des chemins de fer du Québec, 2011). The rail network under provincial jurisdiction \n\nhas grown in the last 20 years, from 564 kilometers of rail in 1993, to more than 1,700 km in 2015 \n\n(Ministère des Transports du Québec, 2015a). \n2.4 AIR TRANSPORTATION \nThe airline sector provides transportation for passengers, freight and other activities, such as \n\naeromedical evacuations, ice patrols, aerial application of products and more. Regarding \n\nfreight services, close to 146,000 tonnes, equivalent to $3.7 billion, were transported by the 380 air \n\ntransportation companies in Quebec in 2010 (MTQ 2013a).There are two international airports (Montréal and Québec City) and various regional airports, \n26 of which are owned by the Ministère des Transports (see Figure 2).\n There are also close to 150 \naerodromes, approximately 50 seaplane bases and approximately 50 heliports. \n\npassengers.

These range from a cold and humid continental climate in the southern \n\nand eastern parts of the province to a sub-polar continental climate in the central regions, a polar \n\ntundra climate up north and more of a maritime climate in the coastal areas towards the Gulf of \n\nthe Saint-Lawrence. All of Québec is affected by climate change and certain trends are already \n\nbeing observed. \n3.1 RISING TEMPERATURES\nSince 1950, temperature trends for both average and extreme temperatures have shown an increase \n\n\n\nchange. Over the period 1951-2010, decreases were recorded in the number of cold days and \n\n\n\nobserved during this same period in the number of hot days, hot nights and length of heat spells.Projections suggest that these trends will continue, with northern latitudes being even more affected. \nMoreover, warming trends will be more prominent for extreme minimum and maximum temperatures \n8  This chapter presents the current and future climate conditions for Québec for the indicators most relevant to the transportation \n\nsector.

For some of these stations, the trends are \n\nassociated with increases in spring and fall precipitation.\nIncreases in precipitation are expected in winter and spring throughout Québec.

In fact, all climate models agree on future upward trends for extreme precipitation events, \n\neverywhere in Québec, although these changes are more substantial moving northward. This applies \n\nfor maximum annual amounts in addition to all durations and frequencies. For example, a maximum \n\nannual rainfall event with a 20-year return period over the 1986-2005 timeframe could occur more \n\nfrequently by 2046-2065 with a return period of around 7 to 10 years. Preliminary studies suggest that \n\nfuture climate conditions could be more conducive to thunderstorms, which are usually accompanied \n\nby larger quantities of precipitation, although the robustness of these projections is uncertain.\n\nFor winter precipitation, the proportion of snow and rainfall relative to total accumulation depends \n\non temperature. Given that the climate has been warming in the recent past, downward snow \n\nprecipitation trends are already being observed in the south of Québec. An analysis of several \n\ndifferent data sources reveals that snow cover duration has decreased by approximately 2 days per \n\ndecade in the south of Québec between 1948 and 2005.Even if snowfall events decrease due to a shorter cold season, rainfall events during this season should \nincrease with warming temperatures in winter (see Figure 6). Changes in snow cover with respect \n\nto these trends will vary according to the region, altitude, climatic regime, type of surface and \n\nvegetation. Compared to the 1970-1999 average, snow cover duration by 2041-2070 could decrease \n\nby up to 25 days in the North of Québec, from 25 to 45 days in the central region, from 45 to 75 days \n\nfor the Gulf of the St. Lawrence and between 45 and 65 days for the south of Québec. \nFigure 6: Observed total summer (JJA: June, July and August) and winter (DJF: December, January and \nFebruary) precipitation for the period 1971-2000 (left panel) and projected (right panels) for the 2050 \nhorizon (2041-2070).

Some of these \n\n\n\n\n\nwill affect the marine estuary and Gulf of the St. Lawrence.

This same study showed that the proportion of maximum ice cover \n\nin the region diminished from approximately 47 % (1968-1998) to 36 % (1998-2013). \nThese trends are likely to continue and projections indicate that freeze-up could arrive about 10-20 \ndays later while thawing could begin 20 to 30 days earlier by 2041-2070, compared to 1982-2011 in the \n\nGulf of the St. Lawrence.

In addition, the built environment in Quebec is aging, \n\nand certain transportation infrastructure is reaching the end of its useful life or needs considerable \n\nrefurbishment (Canadian Infrastructure Report Card, 2012). It may therefore be more vulnerable to \n\nthe impacts of climate change.\ntransportation in Quebec. One section also deals with the telecommunication networks on which \n\nthese modes of transportation depend. The vulnerabilities described are those of infrastructure, but \n\nalso, more generally, those of transportation services operations and management. More information \n\nis available on road transportation, which underscores the importance of this mode in terms of modal \n\nshare, as well as current research and development efforts. \n4.1 GROUND TRANSPORTATION\n4.1.1  VULNERABILITIES OF ROAD TRANSPORTATION IN SOUTHERN QUEBEC AND ALONG \nTHE ST. LAWRENCE \nIn the area that extends to the east of Québec City to the lower North Shore (covering the Lower \n\nSt. Lawrence, the Gaspé Peninsula and the Magdalen Islands), roads and villages are located along \nthe coast. One third of the population in this region and close to 60% of national roads are located \n\nless than 500 metres from the shoreline (Drejza et al., 2014; Boyer-Villemaire et al., 2014). Some portions \n\nof Route 132 that follow the entire south shore of the St. Lawrence, from the United States border west \n\nof Montréal to Gaspé, are located anywhere from a few meters to a few dozen meters from the shore \n\n(McHugh et al., 2006). \nIn the 20th century, this proximity to the river was seen as favourable for transportation, due to the \nsupply of natural resources and marine exploitation. However, the establishment of roads and facilities \n\nalong the St. Lawrence now appears to be a factor that exacerbates their vulnerability (Drejza et al., \n\n2015). The rise in annual average temperatures and especially rising winter temperatures recorded since \n\nthe 1980™s (Bernatchez et al., 2008, Bernatchez, 2015; Savard et al., 2008) have various consequences \n\nsuch as a reduction in ice cover, a relative rise in sea level and an acceleration of cryogenic processes, \n\nwhich contribute to erosion (Bernatchez et al., 2011; Bernatchez et al., 2015; Boyer-Villemaire et al., \n\n2014). More than half of the St. Lawrence estuary and gulf coastlines are prone to erosion (Drejza et \n\nal., 2015). Along the estuary and gulf coastal zone, 294 kilometers of roads are considered to be at risk \n\nby 2065 (Bernatchez et al., 2015). The growth in the built environment along the St. Lawrence estuary \n\nincreases the magnitude of the impact (Bernatchez and Fraser, 2011; Bernatchez et al., 2015; Ouranos, \n\n2015).  The impacts of climate change are already being felt on road infrastructure (Drejza et al., 2014). \n\nSeveral studies have found that erosion problems have required considerable investment to move roads \n\nor build remedial works (Ouranos, 2015; Bernatchez et al., 2015).\nFreeze-thaw cycles are also causing the erosion of several rock cliffs in the St. Lawrence estuary \nand gulf, in southern Quebec (Bernatchez et al., 2014) (\nsee box on coastal erosion in the Magdalen \nIslands), especially in the middle of the cold season by contributing to the continuous expansion of \nwater in the ground, in cliffs or in road surfaces, which can cause cracks, splitting and detachment of \n\ncliffs or mud slides (Boucher-Brossard and Bernatchez, 2013; Drejza et al., 2015).  Although surfaces are \n\nusually designed to resist frost for approximately four months and to withstand large quantities of snow \n\nand melt, rapid snow and ice melt renders these surfaces more vulnerable. Mild temperature periods, \n\nwhich are projected to rise in frequency (Ouranos, 2015) also increase and intensify roadway damage \n\n(Chaumont and Brown, 2010; Doré et al., 2014). \nRoadways currently have a reduced useful lifespan \n', ' 199CHAPTER 7: QUEBEC 199\nincrease the saturation level of the soil and of roadway materials (Masseck, 2014).\nThe relative rise in sea level of approximately 40 centimeters since the beginning of the 20th century \nexposes several portions10 of the Quebec road system, in particular along Highway 20 and Route \n132 (Bernatchez and Fraser, 2011). The rise of relative sea level, among other things, reduces soil \n\nstability under buildings, infrastructure and roads in Quebec (Bernatchez et al., 2012). It decreases \n\nthe stability of the transport system as a whole and, consequently, that of the supply and mobility \n\n\n\nsurges in the St. Lawrence corridor (Savard et al, 2016. Lemmen et al., 2008; Intergovernmental \n\nPanel on Climate Change, 2013). The problem of waves and tides on the Quebec coast along \n\nthe Gulf and up the middle estuary is further compounded by the fact that the coast will be less \n\nprotected by decreasing ice cover. In addition, submersion events could become increasingly \n\nfrequent and intense and reach areas that, until now, were not highly affected. Without adaptation \n\nmeasures that respect the coast™s geomorphology, erosion will continue to affect the natural \n\nsystem, the integrity of the built environment and the quality of life for most communities living in \n\ncoastal areas (Bernatchez, 2015; Ouranos, 2015).\nRiprap11, seawalls, jetties, etc., are forms of protection that reinforce the public™s sense of safety \n(Cooper and Pile, 2014; Friesinger and Bernatchez, 2010; Linham and Nicholls, 2010). That said, these \nmethods are costly and may be a factor in the breakdown of some natural slopes and beaches \n\n(lowering, shrinking, etc.), especially if they are used to protect slopes in loose zones (Bernatchez et \n\ncoll., 2008; Bernatchez, 2015). Where sediment is loose, riprap reduces beaches™ natural ability to \n\nabsorb the energy from storm surges. It is therefore likely to contribute to erosion (Drejza et al., 2014; \n\nBernatchez et al., 2011; Bernatchez and Fraser, 2011) and scour at the edges of riprap and other \n\n\n\nerodes the sand of any unprotected neighboring areas (Bernatchez and Fraser, 2011). \nIn the SeptÎles and Percé \nregions, the width of beaches has shrunk by 85% and 44% respectively, where \n\nOther effects of climate change on terrestrial infrastructure are associated with the increased intensity \n\nof rain precipitation in the winter that could create negative impacts, in particular for the management \n\nof surface water runoff (Groleau et al., 2007). For example, existing drainage systems on coastal roads \n\ncan sometimes contribute to the formation of ravines where water collects (Ministère de la Sécurité \n\npublique du Québec, 2012), and this may trigger landslides and speed up erosion. On the other hand, \n\nin the south of the province, around the St. Lawrence Valley, rising average temperatures and changes \n\nin precipitation patterns could have a positive impact due to less snow and ice on roads, which could \n\ntranslate into lower costs for ice and snow removal of roads (Webster \net al., 2008).  Other effects of climate change on land infrastructure are summarized in Table 2. \n10 A portion of road corresponds to a route itinerary. It can be regional or local.\n11  Riprap is an adaptation option built by dumping of stones of various size with a soft slope in order to absorb and dissipate wave \nenergy before it reaches the shore (Circé et al., 2016)\n', " 200CHAPTER 7: QUEBEC 200Table 2: Summary of certain climate change effects on roadways.

In winter, frozen lakes \nand streams offer various possibilities for travel by all-terrain vehicle, snowmobile and dog sled. As \n\nthe frost period shortens, these possibilities are reduced (Tremblay et al., 2006; Nickels et al., 2005; \n\nBernier et al., 2014). Changes in ice conditions and the shortening of the period when ice is present \n\ncomplicate access to natural resources and to subsistence activities (Clerc et al., 2011; Tremblay \n\n\n\nand their local economy. Alternative trails can be used, but this change in traditional land reduces \n\npossibilities to exploit quality nutritional resources (Barrett, 2013). Moreover, local know-how and \n\nexperience no longer allow snow and ice conditions to be predicted as reliably to plan and organize \n\ntravel (Nickels et al., 2005; Samson et al., 2013). These consequences are likely to affect the cultural \n\nidentity and health of northern populations, in addition to their economic development.\n4.1.3 EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS AND ROAD TRANSPORT\nExtreme weather events will affect road transportation in all regions. Events such as heavy \n\nprecipitation, storms and temperature variations (e.g., freeze-thaw cycles) cause accelerated \n\nwear of road infrastructure (Auld and MacIver, 2005; Case, 2008; Larrivée, 2010). Moreover, when \n\ninfrastructure nears the end of its useful life it becomes more vulnerable to extreme weather events \n\n(Ouranos, 2015). This could increase road maintenance requirements. The integrity and performance \n\nof culverts and bridges may also be affected. \nIn Nunavik, an increase in the occurrence of extreme weather events will have an impact on \ntransportation. Some events (e.g., blizzards, wind, heavy snow) reduce visibility, affecting driving conditions \n\nand the safety of travel on land, causing delays and isolating communities from essential services.\nExtreme weather events can also isolate communities, particularly those that depend on a single mode \nof transportation. The absence of alternative transportation services contributes to the vulnerability \n\nof populations in these regions. For example, the strong waves and storm surges produced by strong \n\nwinds that hit the shores of the Lower Saint-Lawrence, Gaspé, Magdalen Islands and the North Shore on \n\nDecember 5th and 6th, 2010 generated tides 5.54 meters above chart datum in Rimouski, an exceptional \n\n\n\n\nretaining walls, and the area surrounding walls and culverts (see Figure 11). On the basis of replacement \n\ncosts per kilometer and taking into account the existing geographical situation and means of coastal \n\nprotection (Bernatchez et al., 2015), damage was estimated at several million dollars and several \n\nhundred people had to be evacuated (St-Amour, 2011). This winter storm demonstrates the effects that a \n\ncombination of factors, such as a reduction in ice cover, a relative rise in sea level, and wind direction and \n\nstorms, can have on natural and built environments.\nFigure 11: Major deterioration of the Route 132 roadway in the Gaspé Peninsula, in December, 2010. \n\n', ' 202CHAPTER 7: QUEBEC 202Storm surges are related to the height of the sea above the astronomical tide during heavy storms. \nMore frequent storm surges could increase marine submersion events as well as erosion of natural \n\nenvironments such as beaches and dune ridges. Storms can also cause the collapse of breakwaters, \n\ndams and other hydraulic structures (Bernatchez et al., 2012).\nIf sandy beaches are exposed to strong winds for long periods of time in the spring and fall, the winds can \ncarry sand and contribute to moving dunes. This affects road maintenance in the Magdalen Islands.\n\ndirection, relative humidity, precipitation and atmospheric stability (Ordre des ingénieurs forestiers \n\ndu Québec, 2009). These factors vary in time and space, and will likely have a greater adverse \n\neffect in the northwest region of the province \n(Boulanger et al., 2013). The section of the road system \nlocated within the limits of commercial forestry operations primarily serves this industry. Fires caused by \n\nlightning can have a major impact on road access to resources and at the same time, on the vitality \n\nof these industries™ operations and the communities that depend on them. \n\n\n\noperations required protection of the Eastmain and Baie-Johan-Beetz communities. In the James \n\nBay region, the only road connecting Matagami to Radisson was closed for over 300 kilometers, \n\n\n(Gouvernement du Québec, 2013; see Figure\n 12). \nOther types of disturbances to road transportation \n\nare also associated with extreme weather events. \n\nThe uprooting of trees can disrupt road access due \nto the presence of debris.\n  Also, transport planning and road maintenance could be disrupted due \n\nto the increased frequency and intensity of heat \n\nwaves, as extreme heat can expose workers to \n\noccupational illnesses and injuries (e.g., heat stroke, \n\nheat exhaustion and heat cramps) (National \nInstitute for Occupational Safety and Health, 2016). \nRecommended controls for reducing workplace \n\nheat stress include engineering controls (e.g., \n\n\n\nbarriers) and work practices (training, hydration, \nacclimatization and rest breaks) (National Institute \n\nfor Occupational Safety and Health, 2016; \nCommission des normes, de l™équité, de la santé et \n\nde la sécurité du travail, 2016).\n (Source: Société de protection des forêts \ncontre le feu) \n4.2 MARINE TRANSPORTATION\nSome marine infrastructure dates back several decades, with the exception of northern infrastructure \nwhich was created at the turn of the 21\nst century by the provincial and federal governments and \nlocal authorities (Clerc et al., 2011; Ministère des Transports du Québec, 2011). Aging infrastructure, \n\nalong with rising temperatures, reduced ice cover and increased frequency and intensity of extreme \n\nweather events, could increase marine transportation vulnerability.\n4.2.1 MARINE TRANSPORTATION IN THE ST. LAWRENCE CORRIDOR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n', ' 203CHAPTER 7: QUEBEC 203\nof the St. Lawrence (Bouchard and Cantin, 2015). Conversely, in the lower St. Lawrence, in the estuary \n\nand the gulf, a changing climate would likely result in a rise in water level.\nIn the Montréal area, where an average of approximately 2,200 vessels pass each year and where \nmore than one million twenty foot equivalent unit (TEU) containers are transported annually (Port of \n\nMontréal, 2015), this reduction could be in the order of 0.5 to 1.0 meter (Croley, 2003; Fagherazzi et al., \n\n2004; Lefaivre, 2005; Roy and Boyer, 2011). Such a decrease could potentially cause a decline in the \n\nnumber of container ships stopping at the Port of Montréal (Slack and Comtois, 2016).\nintermodal freight transportation system organized around the Port of Montréal. At the same time, \n\nrising temperatures could provide a business opportunity to the Port of Montréal, due to a longer \n\ncommercial navigation season upstream.  The navigation season currently extends from the end of \n\nMarch to the end of December. \nTidal and ice movements associated with a rise in temperatures also affect sediment transport and \nsilting.  This could require adjustments in the management and maintenance of waterways and \n\nmarine infrastructure.  Sediment transport will likely affect navigation throughout the St. Lawrence \n\ncorridor. In some strategic areas, the accumulation of sediment can reduce water levels and become \n\nan obstacle to navigation, which could increase the need to dredge channels and other areas \n\nsurrounding marine infrastructure (Slack and Comtois, 2016). \nClimate projections indicate that in 2040-2070 (compared to the 1982-2011 baseline period), freezing \nwill occur 10 to 20 days later in the estuary and the Gulf, and thaw will be 20 to 30 days earlier \n\n(Senneville et al., 2014). As a result, the period of time when ice traditionally covers the St. Lawrence \n(the months of January, February and March) could be considerably shortened.\n Ice protects the \n\n\nnavigation, an absence or decrease in ice cover will cause waves and storms to erode the coastline, \n\neven in the winter (Bernatchez \net al., 2015; Bernatchez \net al., 2010; Savard \net al., 2010). Also, ice \npile-up near marine infrastructure, caused by strong winds and sea currents, could contribute to the \n\ndeterioration of these facilities. \nThe movement of ferries is also restricted by ice formation. When ice forms rapidly, icebreaking \nservices may be needed from the Canadian Coast Guard, or services to some communities must be \n\nprovided by air transport (Société des traversiers du Québec, 2014).  See Chapter 6, case study 4: \n\nﬁWater levels, ice removal and adaptive management at the St. Lawrence Seaway Management \n\nCorporationﬂ.4.2.2 MARINE TRANSPORTATION IN NUNAVIK\nClimate change will affect storm systems and ice cover in Hudson Bay and, consequently, wave \n\nsystems, extreme water levels and the moisture balance of coastal drainage basins (Clerc et al; \n\n2012; Savard et al., 2016). The main cause of damage to marine infrastructure is the occurrence \n\nof strong waves associated with the passing of storms. Damage often occurs during extreme \n\nconditions, which are rare but very intense, and result in the combination of several phenomena \n\n(e.g. strong waves and extreme water levels) caused by the overlapping of spring tides and storm \n\nsurges (Ouranos, 2015). Studies are underway to precisely quantify the vulnerability of Nunavik \n\nmarine infrastructure to climate change.\n4.3 RAIL TRANSPORTATION\nIn general, climate change vulnerabilities for rail transportation in Quebec are poorly documented. \n\nThe rail management system, which involves private stakeholders and representatives from different \n\nlevels of government (local, provincial and federal) interacting within an international institutional \n\nframework (Canada and the United States), contributes to the complexity of identifying vulnerabilities \n', ' 204CHAPTER 7: QUEBEC 204\n\n\nfor more information on these challenges.\nManaging water runoff along train tracks is a major concern (AREMA, 2003). Extreme weather events \nand episodes of heavy rain can cause drainage and erosion problems, and increase the risk of a \n\nsystem breach due to disruptions in communications. For example, an episode of heavy rain in 2010 \n\neroded the soil under the tracks of a section of the Arcelor Mittal railway. In addition to preventing the \n\n\n\nthroughout the system. Extreme weather events can also increase the risk of tracks being blocked by \n\ndebris. As the climate continues to warm, extreme weather events and episodes of heavy rain will \n\nbecome more frequent and/or more pronounced (Ouranos, 2015) increasing the vulnerability of rail \n\ntransportation in Quebec.Brakes are also frequently tested during bad weather. In some sectors, particularly in the center \nof the province, personnel must remain on site and in personnel camps, during heavy storms. \n\nMaintenance work is then suspended and delays associated with performing inspections and \n\nadditional maintenance costs are to be expected based on the increasing frequency of such events \n\n(Gouvernement du Québec, 2015).\nClimate factors that contribute to triggering landslides (e.g., abundant rain, rapid snow melt and \nsuch other events likely to increase as the climate warms) have a tendency to increase rail system \n\n\n\nregions of the St. Lawrence valley, where soil characteristics interact with land use and exacerbate \n\nthe vulnerability of rail transportation systems. \n\n\n\nthe province, where there is little redundancy. In 2013, Arcelor Mittal Mines Canada, which uses rail \n\ntracks in Quebec and has three camps for its staff, saw its operations restricted for several days near \n\n\n\nactivities, was restricted by near zero visibility conditions. Decreased visibility created by bad weather \n\n\nChanges in freeze-thaw cycles also affect track integrity and can reduce the lifespan of \ninfrastructure. They can also trigger landslides, which is particularly problematic on tracks where \n\nrequired clearances around the infrastructure are minimal. \nTracks undergo a certain expansion during times of extreme heat and a certain contraction during \n\n\nthermal variation, this expansion phenomenon can damage tracks.\n4.3.1 RAIL TRANSPORTATION IN THE ST. LAWRENCE CORRIDOR\n\n\ncoastal train tracks such as the Charlevoix Railway Inc. and the Gaspé Railway Company, as well \n\nas railways located along streams, like the Compagnie de chemin de fer de l™Outaouais and the \n\nChemin de fer Québec Central.  Erosion can compromise network structural integrity, and even cause \n\na complete interruption of activities in the affected region. A landslide in Gascons on the Gaspé \n\nPeninsula suggests such rail network vulnerabilities in this region (Locat et al., 2013). Furthermore, in the \n\nCharlevoix and North Shore areas (around Sept-\nÎles particularly), some track segments are affected \nby challenges related to slope stability, geotechnical issues, or rockfall (Leroueil et al., 2001). \n', ' 205CHAPTER 7: QUEBEC 2054.4 AIR TRANSPORTATION\nMeteorological conditions, including localized events such as strong winds, thunderstorms and heavy \n\n\nas freezing rain followed by strong winds, complicate take-offs and landings.\nIn southern Quebec, air transportation involves multiple national and international connections \nfor passengers and goods. As a reduction in the duration and frequency of freeze-thaw events is \n\nexpected in southern Quebec, runway and aircraft maintenance needs and associated costs could \n\nbe reduced (Mills, 2004), which would be positive for air transportation in the region. \nNevertheless, an increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events could increase the \n\nVillages in Nunavik, those on the Magdalen Islands, and those in the far east of the North Shore are \nparticularly vulnerable to disruptions in air transportation, as they rely heavily on this mode for inter-\n\nregional travel. \nAirport infrastructure in Nunavik was designed between 1984 and 1991 for a stable climate with \nno special measures to protect against permafrost thaw (Guimond et al., 2010). However, rising \n\ntemperatures, and in some cases increased precipitation and runoff, are contributing to permafrost \n\nthaw, resulting in differential soil settlements, and premature damage to infrastructure. Snow \n\naccumulation along runways and embankments serves as an insulator and warms the ground, also \n\ncontributing to thaw (Savard, 2006; Guimond and Boucher, 2013). Some infrastructure is showing signs \n\nof deterioration attributable to permafrost thaw (Guimond et al., 2010). Access roads and landing \n\nstrips in this region could see their lifespan diminish and thus compromise emergency management \n\nand services, and require additional maintenance work. Freeze-thaw events in this region further \n\ncomplicate de-icing and increase maintenance costs for landing strips.\nExtreme weather events also contribute to the vulnerability of air transportation in Nunavik. Although \nfew studies have been done on wind, the Quaqtamiut note [translation] ﬁ[...] a worsening of strong \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAir transportation is sensitive to extreme weather events. A projected increase in the occurrence \n\nof such events would increase runway maintenance needs and, as a result, costs associated with \n\n\n\n\n\n(Transport Canada, 2015, p. 211).\n4.5 DISTRIBUTION AND TELECOMMUNICATION NETWORKS\nTransport and mobility depend greatly on information technology and communications systems.  \n\nInformation and telecommunication networks can be affected by strong winds, thunderstorms, \n\n\n\n\n\nthe entire transportation system. The ice storm in southern Quebec in 1998 illustrates the cascading \n\neffects a disruption due to extreme weather can have on various networks (telecommunications, \n\nservices, electricity, etc.) and thus on the entire transportation system ( Dupigny-Giroux, 2000).\n', ' 206CHAPTER 7: QUEBEC 2065.0 ADAPTATION MEASURES\nClimate change affects all regions of Quebec without concern for administrative limits or shared \njurisdictions, and depends on the collaboration of various levels of government and Quebec™s civil \n\nsociety (Ouranos, 2015). \nClimate change will have both positive and negative effects on construction costs and the lifespan of \nland-based infrastructure (Doré et al., 2014). Several actions can contribute to making infrastructure \n\nmore resilient. Above all, it is important to consider a set of complementary measures. Changing \n\ndesign can improve (or maintain) structural performance. However, increased maintenance activities \n\n\n\npursue work that evaluates the technical, economic and environmental performance of potential \n\nadaptation measures (Doré et al., 2014; Ouranos, 2015).\nThis section reviews plans and projects implemented over the last several years by the Quebec \ngovernment, regional and local organizations and authorities, and transportation companies. There \n\nis relatively little documentation on actions planned or implemented by the private sector to adapt \n\nQuebec™s transportation infrastructure, management and planning systems to climate change. \n5.1  ADAPTATION MEASURES PLANNED AND IMPLEMENTED BY THE QUEBEC \nGOVERNMENT\n\nequipped government authorities to better understand climate risks in Quebec. The CCAP developed \n\n\n\nand non-governmental organizations the means to implement actions to reduce greenhouse gas \n\nemissions and to adapt to climate change (Ministère du Développement durable, de l™Environnement \n\net de la Lutte contre les changements climatiques, 2015). Among the 26 measures of this action \n\n\n\nevaluating and conducting research that helped better understand phenomena that could affect \n\nthe Quebec transportation system. Studies conducted during this period improved understanding \n\nof the coastal environment and how it might change due to the effects of climate change, and \n\n\n\n\n\nappropriate strategies for the design, repair and management of infrastructure. \nIn 2012, the Quebec government adopted a Government Strategy for Climate Change Adaptation \n20132020 (Gouvernement du Québec, 2012a). The Strategy aims to raise public awareness of climate \n\nchange and mobilize several departments and partners, including the MTMDET, regarding the \n\nsustainability and adaptation of transportation infrastructure. To improve services offered to the public \n\nand to adapt transportation, the 2013-2015 MTMDET strategic plan for MTMDET supports diversifying \n\nmodes of transportation. Consideration of climate change is a major part of the plan (MTQ, 2012).The importance of transportation is also recognized in the current action plan on climate change \nentitled « Le Québec en action vert 2020 » ﬁQuebec Green Action 2020ﬂ (Gouvernement du \nQuébec, 2012a). This plan, based on the Government Strategy for Climate Change Adaptation \n\n\n\ninfrastructure and the natural environment. Land-use planning is a key element of the plan, aimed \n\n\n\ninfrastructure needs, including roads (Gouvernement du Québec, 2012a; 2012b). Communication \n\n\n\n\n\nbuilding, knowledge transfer and decision support tools, and technical assistance [...] to targeted \n\naudiencesﬂ (Gouvernement du Québec, 2012a). Efforts on this element have already been launched, \n\n\n ', ' 207CHAPTER 7: QUEBEC 2075.2 ADAPTATION MEASURES ON A REGIONAL AND LOCAL SCALE\nLocal knowledge and community involvement are also important. Knowledge and stories about \nchanges to modes of travel and traditional routes help identify changes to the climate that are \n\n\n\npromote anticipatory adaptation (Cuerrier et al., 2015; Bernatchez et al., 2012; Plante et al, 2015). \n\n\n\n\n\nfelt (Guimond et Boucher, 2013). \nSince 2003, the MTMDET has had a thermal monitoring program for airport infrastructure in Nunavik \n(under its jurisdiction), built on land sensitive to thaw (Guimond et Boucher, 2013). In the last decade, \n\nmapping of permafrost areas in northern communities has been undertaken to support land-use \n\nplanning (L™Hérault et al., 2013). By using data from geotechnical research, such mapping determines \n\nwhich areas to avoid, which require more information, and which require special construction \n\n\nprocedures for the area, based on existing knowledge (L™Hérault et al., 2013; also see Case Study\n 2). \n\n\nStudies, and other more detailed studies are underway (Allard, Calmels, et al., 2007; L™Hérault et al., 2013). \n\n\n\nsubject of several studies since the early 2000™s (Allard, Fortier, et al., 2007; Doré et al., 2014; Allard et al., \n\n\n\nfrequent maintenance and improvements to drainage techniques (L™Hérault et al., 2013). \nThe MTMDET and the Center for Northern Studies recently collaborated in the development of an \nadaptation strategy for airport structures vulnerable to permafrost thaw (Guimond et al., 2010). \n\nTemperature monitoring devices were embedded at 13 airports in Nunavik to monitor the condition \n\nof runways in real-time.  Adaptation techniques were tested on two problem sites (see Case Study \n\n1). The Kuujjuaq landing strip was the subject of a study by Transport Canada, while more generally, \n\nregular monitoring is undertaken to verify the condition of transportation facilities (airports, access \n\nroads and marine infrastructure). \n\nfor building in order to ensure the sustainability of transportation infrastructure and operations \n\n(L™Hérault et al., 2013). Awareness tools and best practice guides have also been developed by \n\nmunicipal authorities in order to inform employees and suggest concrete actions to reduce the \n\nimpact of climate change on infrastructure (for example, drainage and snow management on land \n\ninfrastructure).\n', ' 208CHAPTER 7: QUEBEC 208CASE STUDY 1: MONITORING THE THERMAL BEHAVIOUR OF \nTHE SALLUIT AIRPORT ACCESS ROAD AND TESTING A \n\nMETHOD TO DETECT PERMAFROST DEGRADATION ALONG \n\nLINEAR STRUCTURES IN THE CONTEXT OF CLIMATE CHANGE\nA section of the Salluit Airport access road in Nunavik is built on permafrost made up of ice-rich marine \n\n\nthaw in this section. In 2012, the MTMDET proceeded with the reconstruction of this section of road in order \nto maintain safe land access year-round, in the context of a changing climate. The embankment design \nwas adapted by integrating it with new design criteria that aimed to promote a rise in the permafrost \n\n\n\ncable to detect sectors at risk of deterioration along the road, and the implementation of an embankment \nwith a large scale heat sink as an adaptation solution. This project was undertaken by the MTMDET, in \ncollaboration with the Center for Northern Studies and the Laval University surface engineering research \n\ngroup. \nhttp://www.mddelcc.gouv.qc.ca/changementsclimatiques/bilan-2012-2013/adaptation.htm Monitoring the state of the environment and infrastructure is important and several management measures \n\nand design measures (e.g., lessening the slope of the dyke; replacing culverts) can be implemented to \n\nreduce the impact of climate risks (Transportation Association of Canada, 2010).

Among other uses, modelling with \nthis data makes it possible to consider the consequences of a dam collapse, recognize the impact that \nprecipitation has on the road system, and plan alternative routes.\nCASE STUDY 2\nGouvernement du Québec\n, \ncollaboration of the MTMDET and MSP, has conducted various research projects on the adaptation of \ndesign criteria for coastal remedial works (Ministère du Développement durable, de l™Environnement \n\net de la Lutte contre les changements climatiques, 2014). \nIn addition, studies on the vulnerability of \nroad infrastructure in eastern Quebec were conducted by the chair in coastal geoscience at the \n\nUniversité du Québec in Rimouski (Drejza et al, 2014; Drejza et al, 2015.).\nOngoing efforts to model the hydrology of the St. Lawrence drainage basin are helping to plan for the \n\n\nCantin, 2015). However, port authorities and marine industry representatives appear less equipped to \n\nanticipate extreme weather events such as storms, hurricanes, etc., that will have a greater effect on \n\ntheir operations in the coming years (Slack and Comtois, 2016). \n', ' 209CHAPTER 7: QUEBEC 209Following a study by INRS (Mailhot et al., 2014), as of 2015 the MTMDET has applied a new loading \n25 km2, depending on the region of Quebec, to account for \nclimate change (MTMDET 2015).  This adjustment factor was 10% until recently. \nThe use of the GéoRISC \nportal also contributed to dam management (see Case Study 2). \nOn a more local level, several studies (see summary in Savard et al., 2008) led jointly by the \nMinistère \nde la Sécurité publique, the Université du Québec à Rimouski, Ouranos and the City of SeptÎles, \ncontributed to a better understanding of the causes and factors associated with coastal erosion.\n The municipality of Sept-Îles then zoned its territory to better control usage along the shoreline and \n\n\n\nof coastal terrain. The City of Sept-Îles, where roads are seriously affected by bank erosion, has \n\n\nprohibited riprap in several areas. \nAlthough it is included on a list of remedial works to prevent road erosion, riprap may be less \nadvantageous from an economic and structural perspective than alternative protection options \n\n\n\nriprap and oversizing alone cannot ensure the resilience of coastal areas to heightened erosion and \n\nan increased frequency, duration and intensity of extreme weather events, the City of Sept-Îles is \n\nworking with the SeptRivières RMC and the Quebec government to come up with a plan for coastal \n\nprocedures (Natural Resources Canada, 2015).

A combination of measures would help better manage stormwater issues. \nExtreme weather events appear to pose the greatest risk for infrastructure and transportation systems \nin all seasons. Infrastructure design, along with all aspects of operation, maintenance, management \n\nand refurbishment is, and will continue to be, affected by climate change.\nAdaptation is a social and institutional challenge that should be treated in an integrated fashion. \nThe impact of climate change on infrastructure cannot be studied in isolation from other factors \n\n\n\nmanagement.

FINDINGS \n The climate risks of greatest concern to transportation operators, provincial governments, and \nmunicipalities in Atlantic Canada are extreme weather events and storm surges. \nHurricanes, high \nwinds, heavy precipitation, and extreme snowfall have resulted in costly damage and shipping \n\n\n\nAs storm frequency and intensity increases, these impacts will likely continue to be severe. \n While most actions to enhance the climate resilience of transportation systems have been taken \n\nin response to past impacts from extreme weather, future climate risks (such as sea level rise) are \n\nincreasingly spurring planning and investments\n. Coordinated partnerships and initiatives suggest \n\nAtlantic provinces are actively engaged in adaptation planning. Risk assessments\n and regional \n\n\nfuture decision-making.\n Transportation practitioners are accounting for projected climate changes in the planning and \n\noperation of some roads, bridges, railways, and marine ports in Atlantic Canada, but actions \n\nrelated to airports are less well-documented.\n\n\n\nfor all modes. \n \n\n\n. These include constructing physical barriers (seawalls, breakwaters, \n\n\nrelocating and/or elevating infrastructure.\n Regionally-focused weather- and climate-monitoring technologies are helping transportation \n\noperators identify and adapt to climate risks in Atlantic Canada. Examples include SmartAtlantic \nmonitoring buoys to inform extreme-weather preparedness and better understand changes in \n\nocean climate, and the Coastal Impact Visualization Environment (CLIVE) tool, which allows \n\nusers to visualize changing coastlines in Prince Edward Island. These technologies assist with risk \n\nassessment and help practitioners communicate the magnitude of short- and long-term impacts \n\nto decision-makers.', ' 221CHAPTER 8: ATLANTIC CANADA\n 2211.0 INTRODUCTION \nAtlantic Canada includes the provinces of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, \nand Newfoundland and Labrador. While each province has unique geographic and cultural \n\ncharacteristics, their shared proximity to the Atlantic Ocean and combined coastlines (exceeding \n\n40,000 km) (Environment Canada, 2012) result in many common climate vulnerabilities for \n\ntransportation systems. These include risks associated with both extreme weather events (e.g., \n\n\n\ntemperature and precipitation).

It addresses all four major transportation \n\nmodes (roads, rail, marine, and air).  \nLiterature examining the impacts of climate on transportation systems in Atlantic Canada is quite \nlimited. Therefore, this chapter draws heavily upon other sources of information, including interviews \n\nwith transportation professionals. This research complements other assessments of climate impacts \n\nand adaptation for Atlantic Canada as a whole (Vasseur and Catto, 2008) and the Atlantic coast \n\n\n1.1 ENVIRONMENTAL CHARACTERISTICS\n\nCanada and Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, 1999). Prominent landforms include rugged \n\nmountains (e.g., the Torngat Mountains in Labrador), fertile valleys (e.g., the Saint John River Valley in \n\nNew Brunswick and the Annapolis Valley in Nova Scotia), and extensive coastlines.

The region experienced modest \n\npopulation growth from 2006 to 2011 (a provincial average of 2.2 percent), although at lower rates \n\nthan the national average (5.9 percent) (Statistics Canada, 2011).

Prince Edward Island shares \n\na similar freight pattern, with the majority of exports distributed across Canada. Newfoundland and \n\nLabrador is more closely connected to global supply chains than other Atlantic provinces, with \n\n\n\nrest of the world (Lambert-Racine, 2013).\nThe Atlantic region is North America™s closest access point to Europe, and major ports in New Brunswick, \nNova Scotia, and Newfoundland and Labrador play an important role (Canada™s Atlantic Gateway, \n\n2010). The regional economy is positioned for further growth in global trade, including increasing \n\nconnections with emerging Asian markets through the Suez Canal. These trends are already underway \n\nŒ for example, the values of exports from Newfoundland and Labrador to China, the United Kingdom, \n\nNetherlands and France increased by more than 400 percent from 2010 to 2013 (Newfoundland and \n\nLabrador Statistics Agency, 2015). As trade activity along many regional and external routes expands, \n\ntransportation operators are working to provide the capacity to meet this demand.  \n\nminerals, lumber and pulp products, potatoes, and other vegetables. Key imports include many of \n\nthese same commodities, as well as machinery/mechanical parts (Atlantic Canada Opportunities \n\nAgency, 2012).  \n', ' 223CHAPTER 8: ATLANTIC CANADA\n 2232.0 REGIONAL CLIMATE PROFILE\n2.1 OBSERVED CLIMATE TRENDS\nAtlantic Canada™s historic climate record is characterized by high year-to-year variability, as well as \nvariability in long-term trends (over several decades) in several key climate parameters. For the period \n\n1948-2014, mean annual temperature in the Atlantic Canada Climate Region\n4 increased 0.7°C, similar \nto the global average for the same period and representing the least amount of warming of any \n\nCanadian region (Environment Canada, 2015a). Increases have also been observed in sea-surface \n\ntemperatures and ocean acidity (Loder et al., 2013). No clear trend is evident for mean annual \n\nprecipitation in the region, although both summer and fall have experienced precipitation increases \n\n(Mekis and Vincent, 2011).\nOf greater interest to Atlantic Canada™s transportation system are changing patterns of extreme \n\n\ninland and coastal), and exacerbate issues in areas prone to erosion. Due to the rarity of extreme \n\n\n\n\n\nincrease at some locations in Atlantic Canada, but a decrease at others (Bush et al., 2014). While \n\nchanges in average wind speeds and direction are absent from the historic record, analysis of the \n\ndensity of intense storm centres for the period 1961-2000 indicates that Atlantic Canada includes \n\nsome of the stormiest areas in North America (Savard et al., 2016). While the frequency of North \n\n\n\nAgency, 2015), the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change™s Fifth Assessment Report (2013) and \n\nthe United States Global Change Research Program (2014) note that hurricane intensity has increased \n\nin the Atlantic region since the 1980s. \nChanges in sea ice cover and sea levels have implications for marine and coastal transportation \n\n\nvariability remains high (Figure 1). Reduced sea-ice cover makes coasts more vulnerable to erosion \n\nby waves during winter storms. Trends in relative sea level for most of Atlantic Canada, excluding \n\nLabrador, show slow and steady sea-level rise. This increase is primarily due to glacial isostatic \n\nadjustment in the Atlantic provinces, referring to the slow vertical land motion or ﬁreboundingﬂ of \n\nland depressed by hundreds of metres under ice sheets during the most recent ice age (James et al., \n\n2014). Sea-level rise results in impacts from waves and storm surge at higher coastal sites not previously \n\nat risk (Atkinson et al., 2016).4  Including New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and the island of Newfoundland, but excluding Labrador.\n', ' 224CHAPTER 8: ATLANTIC CANADA\n 224Figure 1: Historical total accumulated ice coverage for the weeks of December 11-February 7 from \n1980 to 2015 in Atlantic Canada and the St. Lawrence estuary (see inset map). \n(Source: Environment \nand Climate Change Canada) 2.2 FUTURE CLIMATE PROJECTIONS\nProjected changes in climate in Atlantic Canada for the 21\nst century include continued warming of \nair and water temperatures, as well as increased precipitation. Recent analysis as part of a global \nclimate model comparison project\n5 suggest increases in mean annual temperature of\n 1°C in the \nnear term (2016-2035) to about 3°C by the end of the century. \nThe greatest warming is projected \nto occur in winter. Mean annual precipitation is projected to increase by about 3 percent in the \n\nnear term and almost 10 percent by the end of the century throughout the region, with the greatest \n\nincreases occurring in winter and spring. \nSnowfall is likely to comprise a reduced proportion of total \nprecipitation; the seasonal duration of snow cover will likely decrease (Swansburg et al., 2004); and \n\nfreezing rain events are likely to increase during winter (Cheng et al.\n, 2011). Tables A1-A4\n (located \n\n\nfor the Atlantic region to 2100\n over three time horizons. Seasonal periods include winter (December-\nFebruary), spring (March-May), summer (June-August), and autumn (September-November).

In areas such as Nain, Labrador, where sea level is currently falling \n\ndue to glacial isostatic rebound, sea level will either continue to fall at a slower rate, or it may start \n\nto rise, depending on the magnitude of change in global mean sea level (James et al., 2014). \n\nProjections for Atlantic Canada indicate that under a high-emissions scenario, up to 100 cm of \n\nsea level rise is possible at some locations by 2100 (Figure 2), and that larger increases cannot be \n\nprecluded (Savard et al., 2016; Atkinson et al., 2016). Global mean sea level will continue to rise for \n\n\n\nreduce global greenhouse gas emissions (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2013).\nFigure 2: Projections of relative sea-level rise for the year 2100 for the median value of the high-\nemissions scenario (RCP8.5; after James et al., 2014).

The corridor is the only land connection between Nova \n\nScotia and New Brunswick, and is highly vulnerable to storm surge and sea level rise (Figure 4; also see \n\nCase Study 5). A system of dykes, which includes rail embankments in some stretches, was originally \n\nbuilt by the Acadians to create agricultural land and currently protects land and rail, road and other \n\ninfrastructure in the Isthmus (Webster et al., 2012). \nA second important rail link in Atlantic Canada is a short section of rail in Labrador that connects to \nthe Quebec North Shore and Labrador Railway (QNS & L).  The shipment of iron ore from Labrador \n\nvia the QNS & L represents the largest component of total commercial rail tonnage moving out of \n\nAtlantic Canada (Stassinu-Stantec Limited Partnership, 2011). Prince Edward Island and the island of \n\nNewfoundland do not have operational rail lines, while a few independently-owned short-line systems \n\noperate in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. \n', ' 228CHAPTER 8: ATLANTIC CANADA\n 228Figure 4: Colour-shaded relief digital elevation model of the Chignecto Isthmus at the New \nBrunswick-Nova Scotia border.

(Source: Applied Geomatics Research Group, Nova Scotia Community College) \nLarge freight volumes are also moved by truck in Atlantic Canada. While the majority is destined for \n\nat Woodstock and St. Stephen, New Brunswick (Transport Canada, 2014). Major highways and \n\nconnector roads also link cities, towns, and provinces in Atlantic Canada (see Figure 5). \nSt. John™s, Newfoundland is the easternmost point of the Trans-Canada Highway and joins continental \nCanada via ferry, while a highway to northern Quebec joins Labrador to the rest of the country. \n\nPrince Edward Island is linked to New Brunswick via the Confederation Bridge. Completed in 1997, the \n\n12.9 km stretch is the longest bridge in the world over seasonally ice-covered water (Strait Crossing \n\nBridge Ltd., 2015) and facilitates the movement of people and goods between the mainland and \n\nthe island year-round. The Trans-Canada Highway connects New Brunswick to Quebec and areas \n\nwest through the most northwestern point of the province, and to Nova Scotia across the Chignecto \n\n\n\net al., 2012; Marlin, 2013). ', ' 229CHAPTER 8: ATLANTIC CANADA\n 229Figure 5: Atlantic Canada™s road network.\n3.2 MARINE TRANSPORTATION \nEach Atlantic province has specialized marine transportation infrastructure. The Port of Halifax is the \n\n\nice-free harbour provides services for both international and short-sea shipping, and contributed \n\n$1.6 billion to the Atlantic economy in 2013 (Port of Halifax, 2015; Cirtwill et al., 2001). The Port also \n\n\n\nU.S. Northeast and Midwest, Quebec, and Ontario (Canada™s Atlantic Gateway, 2010). It recently \n\ncompleted a $35 million expansion to host wider, post-Panamax\n6 containerships (Power, 2012).\n\n\n\nAtlantic Gateway, 2010). These products make up the majority of Atlantic Canada™s marine freight, \n\nmuch of which originates in Newfoundland. Ferries also play an important role in moving freight (as well \n\nas people). Marine Atlantic, a crown corporation providing ferry services, accounts for approximately 50 \n\npercent of all goods shipped to and from Canada™s mainland to Newfoundland via Port aux Basques \n\nand/or Argentia to North Sydney crossings (Marine Atlantic, 2015). \nMarine tourism is another important contributor to the region™s economy, operating at peak capacity \nin summer. The cruise industry is growing in Atlantic Canada, accounting for 31 percent of Canada™s \n\n\n\n\n\napproximately 400% between the years 2007 and 2015 (Corryn Morrissey, Charlottetown Harbour \n6   Post-Panamax describes ships that do not fall within the current allowable dimensions for passing through the Panama Canal. \n\nOperators of the Panama Canal are currently constructing a new lock system, designed to handle these larger ﬁpost-Pana\n-maxﬂ ships.', ' 230CHAPTER 8: ATLANTIC CANADA\n 230Authority, personal communication, 2016). Ferry routes support tourism and regional connectivity. \nIn Newfoundland and Labrador, a number of ferry routes travel from Labrador to the island of \n\nNewfoundland, including St. Barbe-Blanc Sablon and Goose Bay-Cartwright-Lewisporte. Ferries from \n\nNorth Sydney, Nova Scotia travel to Newfoundland, while Nova Scotia connects to Prince Edward \n\nIsland via the Caribou-Wood Island Ferry. Other key routes include the Nova Scotia-New Brunswick \n\nroute via Digby to Saint John, and the route operating between Prince Edward Island and \nÎles de la \nMadeleine, Quebec (Souris to Cap-aux-Meules) (Ferry CTMA, 2015). \n3.3 AIR TRANSPORTATION \n\n\nthe region™s population size (Atlantic Canada Airports Association, 2012). The airport system includes \n\nseven National Airports System (NAS)7 airports (below) in addition to many smaller community airports: \n Fredericton International Airport, Greater Moncton International Airport, and Saint John Airport \n\n(New Brunswick); \n Gander International Airport, and St. John™s International Airport (Newfoundland and Labrador);\n \n Charlottetown Airport (Prince Edward Island).\nLess freight is moved by air than by other modes in the Atlantic region Œ usually only time-sensitive or \n\n\n\nannually (Atlantic Canada Airports Association, 2012).4.0 ROAD TRANSPORTATION: IMPACTS AND ADAPTATIONS\n4.1 PAST IMPACTS AND FUTURE RISKS\nA number of climate-related variables, including extreme weather events, storm surges, and freeze-\n\nthaw cycles, have impacts on both road infrastructure and operations in Atlantic Canada.\nEXTREME EVENTS \nThe most severe regional-scale impacts are related to tropical or post-tropical storms, and associated \n\nwith heavy precipitation, strong winds, and storm surges. Examples include Hurricane Juan \n\n(September 2003), which resulted in $100 million in direct damages to infrastructure in Halifax alone, \n\nincluding roads and highways (Bowyer, 2003a), and Hurricanes Earl and Igor, which struck within a \n\nweek of each other in September, 2010 resulting in road closures throughout Atlantic Canada. In \n\nNewfoundland and Labrador, approximately 150 communities were isolated by road closures during \n\nHurricane Igor, and parts of the Trans-Canada Highway were washed away (Canadian Climate \n\nForum, 2014). The prospect of more frequent extreme weather events (i.e. shortened return periods) \n\n\n\n\nWind gusts from 80-160 km/h have been recorded regionally during tropical and post-tropical storm \nevents (Environment Canada, 2013b). High winds have closed major Atlantic bridges such as Halifax™s \n\nMacDonald Bridge and the Confederation Bridge (Catto et al., 2006). In summer 2014, Hurricane \n7  \n\nmovements (Transport Canada, 2010). \n', ' 231CHAPTER 8: ATLANTIC CANADA\n 231Arthur uprooted hundreds of trees in Fredericton, New Brunswick, blocking streets until city crews \ncould remove the fallen vegetation (Case Study 1). \nHigh winds also occur independently of tropical storms. For instance, 170 km of highway (from \nMoncton, New Brunswick to Truro, Nova Scotia) through the Chignecto Isthmus has been closed due \n\nto strong winds and blowing snow (CBC News, 2015a). Also, the stretch of Trans-Canada Highway \n\nnear Wreckhouse, Newfoundland and Labrador often experiences strong winds funnelled from the \n\nsouthern end of the Long Range Mountains. Trucking companies in this region use constant-monitoring \n\ntechnology to reduce accident risks. One Newfoundland company has reported trucks overturning \n\ndue to high winds in Wreckhouse and the Northern Peninsula (Fleming, 2014). \nCASE STUDY 1: HURRICANE ARTHUR™S IMPACTS ON \nTRANSPORTATION IN FREDERICTON \nFredericton, New Brunswick (population 57,000) is located on a broad sweep of the Saint John River. \n\n\nmanage. \nOn Saturday July 5, 2014, Hurricane Arthur transformed into a strong post-tropical storm and made landfall \nin western Nova Scotia. Fredericton experienced a prolonged period of heavy rain and high winds from \n\nthe storm system, including 150 mm of rain (recorded at Base Gagetown near Fredericton) and 100 km/h \n\nwind gusts at Fredericton International Airport. The combination of wind and rain saturated the soil and \ncaused widespread tree damage and power outages in the city.\nThe storm affected roads and sidewalks, the public walking trail network, and Fredericton International \n\n\nmany cases, electrical lines were intertwined with branches, requiring a joint response from New Brunswick \nPower and the City to clear routes for emergency vehicles. The airport also experienced a lengthy power \noutage and relied on generators to maintain operations. \nHurricane Arthur was not typical in that it was an early-season tropical storm, hitting Fredericton when \ntrees were at their heaviest due to the weight of new leaf growth (and before branches and trunks had \nstrengthened to support this growth). More intense and unusual weather events, such as Arthur, have the \nCity rethinking standard business practices, including:\n Planting different tree species and varieties in public rights- of-way to ensure resilience and minimize \n\ntree failure, which will reduce impacts to the street, trail, and sidewalk system;\n Implementing an intensive pruning program to enable trees to withstand severe weather; and\n Reviewing and upgrading staff training and equipment in anticipation of future storms.     \nThe City is also working jointly with the University of New Brunswick Forestry program to undertake a street-\ntree inventory. Prior to replanting trees, characteristics such as height, root system, canopy, and resilience \nof various species will be assessed to ensure that new trees can better withstand high winds and soil \n\nsaturation. \nThis example illustrates the indirect impacts of extreme weather on transportation operations, particularly \nin urban environments. Collaboration across sectors such as electricity, forestry, and transportation is \nimportant to enhance the resilience of urban systems to climate change.\n\nCASE STUDY 1', ' 232CHAPTER 8: ATLANTIC CANADA\n 232\nNova Scotia, 2009b). The structural integrity of one major bridge in Corner Brook, Newfoundland, has \n\n\nclose the bridge at times for safety (Rayna Luther, City of Corner Brook Infrastructure and Public Works, \npersonal communication, 2015). The segment of Trans-Canada highway in the Chignecto Isthmus is \nalso sensitive to storm-surge inundation (see Case Study 5).\nIn Prince Edward Island, where no point is more than 16 km from the sea, infrastructure is especially \nvulnerable to high-water damage.   For example, a severe storm surge in December 2010 resulted \n\nCorran Ban Bridge and Rustico Bridge (Figure 6).\n  Additionally, the predominantly sandstone \ncomposition of Prince Edward Island™s coastline is inherently susceptible to erosion resulting from \nstorm surge and high water events.\n  In Prince Edward Island, at least two\n coastal public roads have \nbeen abandoned in recent years, due to erosion (Brian Thompson, Government of Prince Edward \nIsland, personal communication, 2016).  This results not only in disruptions to property owners, and \nthe traveling public, but in unscheduled government expenditures to secure land and construct \n\nalternate routes where applicable (Brian Thompson, Government of Prince Edward Island, personal \ncommunication, 2016).  Coastline erosion rates have been increasing in P.E.I.\n  The average rate of \nerosion grew from 28 cm per year between 1968 and 2010, to 40 cm per year between 2000 and 2010 \n(Webster, 2012).\n  Without taking into account rising sea levels and increasing storms associated with \n\nof roads at risk from coastal erosion by 2100 (Fenech, 2014).\n  \nst century in areas that \nexperience sea-level rise, including most of Atlantic Canada.  This in turn increases risks to coastal \n\nroads and bridges.\nFigure 6:   Flooding of Oyster Bed Bridge during a storm in December, 2010. \n(Source: Don Jardine)\n', ' 233CHAPTER 8: ATLANTIC CANADA\n 233TEMPERATURE AND PRECIPITATION CHANGES\nFreeze-thaw cycles are taxing on road systems, particularly when temperature changes are rapid. \nWhen the frequency of freeze-thaw cycles increases, the potential for rapid road deterioration \n\nand higher maintenance costs rises as well. For example, by the end of approximately three weeks \n\n\n\napproximately 300 were more than two inches deep and therefore assigned a ﬁpriorityﬂ designation \n\n(Bradshaw, 2015). These cycles are expected to become more frequent throughout most of the \n\nAtlantic region over the short term. Freeze-thaw frequency is expected to decline over the long term \n\nas average winter temperatures rise (Boyle et al., 2013).\nRain-on-snow events also affect Atlantic Canada™s roads. In 1962, approximately 180 mm of rain \non heavy snow on Prince Edward Island™s southern coast caused extensive washouts and damage \n\nto paved highways (Atlantic Climate Adaptation Solutions Association, 2011). A similar event in \n\nDecember 2014 caused $9 million in damages to bridges and roadways in Prince Edward Island \n\n(McCarthy, 2014; Wright, 2015). Rapid snow melt can also cause problems for municipal drainage \n\nsystems. When temperatures ranged from -27°C to 7°C in the span of a month in Corner Brook, \n\n\n\nof time, overloading the capacity of stormwater management infrastructure (Rayna Luther, City of \n\nCorner Brook Infrastructure and Public Works, personal communication, 2015). \nWarmer winters are associated with more frequent freezing rain and black-ice conditions, affecting \n\n\n2013).  Warmer winter temperatures also affect the safety and usability of informal seasonal ice routes \n\nin northern Labrador and New Brunswick that provide access to and from communities across frozen \n\nbodies of water (CBC News, 2012; Nalcor Energy, 2014). \nExtreme temperatures also have negative effects on road infrastructure. Interior regions of New \nBrunswick and Nova Scotia have already experienced an increase in the frequency of hot days, and \n\nthis trend is expected to continue (Steeves, 2013), increasing the risk of road damage and adding \n\nstress to bridge joints. While extreme cold is not likely to increase in frequency, abnormally cold days \n\n\n\nicy conditions. \n4.2 ADAPTATION PRACTICES \nIn light of these impacts, governments and private operators are using a number of strategies to \n\nenhance the resilience of road infrastructure. Flood risks are a particular focus of these efforts.\nPHYSICAL PROTECTION MEASURESSome Atlantic municipalities are constructing seawalls, breakwaters, and dykes to protect roads \n\nagainst sea-level rise and higher storm surges (Liverman et al., 1994; Batterson et al., 1999; Halifax \n\nRegional Municipality, 2012). These buffers protect low-lying infrastructure from overtopping \n\n(which occurs when water rises higher than a dyke or levee). The construction of higher dykes and \n\n\n\n(Graham and Musselman, n.d.). Case Study 2 discusses an example of this type of adaptation in \n\nHalifax, Nova Scotia.In areas of extreme concern, such as the Chignecto Isthmus corridor, ﬁhardeningﬂ of the surrounding \nland by means of a dyke system has protected the roads to date, although further efforts (hard, soft \n\nand hybrid engineering approaches) to protect infrastructure and communities under projected \n\nclimate scenarios have recently been investigated (see Case Study 5). \n', ' 234CHAPTER 8: ATLANTIC CANADA\n 234CASE STUDY 2: DEFENSIVE ADAPTATION IN COW BAY \n(HALIFAX, NOVA SCOTIA)\nThe Cow Bay Causeway is a 350 m stretch of road built over a beach of cobble and boulder. For many \nyears, despite protection by a breakwater, the road was susceptible to damage from wave overwash. \n\n\n the existing breakwater:\n1. The breakwater was not high enough in some areas to prevent waves from overtopping. \n2. \n\nstorm; the causeway was closed at least twice a year for safety reasons. \n3. Voids between the existing armour stones allowed small stones and seaweed to wash through the \n\nbreakwater and be deposited on the roadway.\nAs a result, the causeway often experienced extensive damage from storms, and required repairs every \n\n\n\ntropical storm Noel in 2007, and a January 2010 storm) and risks of future impacts prompted the Halifax \n\nRegional Municipality to commission a study and recommendations for the redesign of the causeway and \n\nits breakwater. The study employed a statistical risk assessment model known as the Coastal Infrastructure \n\nAdaptation Planning System (CIAPS) to analyze the interaction of future tidal and storm-surge conditions \n\nalong the coast with the anticipated performance of the existing breakwater, as well as to determine the \n\nappropriate elevations for more resilient infrastructure (Davies et al., 2010). Four adaptation alternatives \n\n\n1. \n2. \n3. Rebuilding the barrier in its entirety (including impermeable technologies); or\n4. Rebuilding the barrier in prioritized phases (Davies et al., 2010).Figure 7: Cow Bay Causeway experiencing a \nstorm.\n (Photo of Cow Bay Causeway taken January 26th, 2010 by M. Davies, Coldwater Consulting Ltd) CASE STUDY 2–', ' 235CHAPTER 8: ATLANTIC CANADA\n 235The risk assessment suggested that the cost-optimized solution was to rebuild the causeway™s breakwater in \ntwo phases. The design included: An increase in the height of the breakwater; \n A 600 mm-by-2.5 m concrete core;  \n 4-to-8-tonne armour stone on the outer face of the breakwater; \n A breakwater crest approximately 9 m wide; and\n A seaward slope (two blocks horizontal for one block vertical). \nEach phase included completion of approximately half of the breakwater length, and the design allowed \nfor the increase in wave height anticipated under future sea-level and storm-surge conditions. The project \nwas tendered in 2012, and Phase 1 was awarded with a budgeted construction cost of $670,000 (Davies et \n\nal., 2010; Halifax Regional Municipality, 2012). Phase 2 was completed in 2013. \nWhile the new breakwater has not yet dealt with a major hurricane event, local practitioners suggest that \nthe infrastructure has been successful in mitigating the effects of heavy storms and wave action to date \n(David Hubley, Halifax Regional Municipality, personal communication, 2016).\n–STORMWATER MANAGEMENT PRACTICES\n\nstormwater management practices. These include: \n \n\naccount for increased precipitation. Examples include the City of Fredericton, New Brunswick \n\n(Arisz, n.d.), the City of Corner Brook, Newfoundland (City of Corner Brook, 2012), and the Town of \n\nStratford, Prince Edward Island (CBCL Ltd., 2012).\n using the Public Infrastructure Engineering Vulnerability Committee™s (PIEVC) risk assessment \n\nprotocol to assess the climate change vulnerability of roads and stormwater management \n\nsystems. Examples include Sandy Point, Nova Scotia; Miramichi, New Brunswick; and, Placentia, \n\nNewfoundland and Labrador (Municipality of the District of Shelburne, 2011; City of Miramichi, \n\n2013; Engineers Canada, 2014). In response to PIEVC recommendations, Sandy Point is investing in \n\n\n\nPlacentia are considering larger culvert sizes along the road corridors that were assessed (City of \n\nMiramichi, 2013; Engineers Canada, 2014).\n\nto Atlantic Canada.  These include building rain gardens/retention ponds; using permeable \n\n\n\ncoordinating stormwater management at the watershed-scale (i.e. maintaining natural river channels \n\nand wetlands) (Marsalek and Schreier, 2010; Kessler, 2011).\n', ' 236CHAPTER 8: ATLANTIC CANADA\n 236INFRASTRUCTURE RELOCATION \n\nbeing inundated or unusable, due to sea-level rise, storm surges, and coastal erosion (Transportation \n\nResearch Board, 2008; Davidson-Arnott and Ollerhead, 2011). Some municipalities in Atlantic Canada \n\nhave chosen to locate new roads away from coastal areas (Graham and Musselman, n.d.); or \n\nelevate infrastructure when feasible (i.e. Moncton, New Brunswick; see Chapter 9) (AMEC Inc., 2011). \n\nFor example: The Confederation Bridge, which connects PEI to the Canadian mainland in New Brunswick, was \n\nbuilt to accommodate a one metre rise in sea levels over 100 years.  The bridge was also designed \n\nto allow ice blocks to pass safely underneath (Gregg, 2010). \n The Prince Edward Island Department of Transportation is rebuilding the Souris bridge one metre \n\nhigher, due to sea level rise projections (Government of Prince Edward Island, 2015). \n Nova Scotia™s provincial government recently rebuilt its 100-series highways further inland from \n\ntheir original coastal locations to provide safer and faster corridors; as a result, these highways are \n\nmuch less sensitive to coastal hazards (Finck, 2013).\n The New Brunswick Department of Transportation rebuilt and raised a bridge on the main road into \n\nPointe-du-Chêne to accommodate future sea-level rise (Daigle, 2011). \n Relocation of the section of Trans-Canada Highway along the Chignecto Isthmus has been \n\ndiscussed as a potential long-term adaptation solution, but is presently considered too costly (see \n\nCase Study 5).OPERATIONAL AND MAINTENANCE PRACTICES\nOperators are also adapting to challenging weather conditions. For example, one trucking company \n\n\n\nhas found a creative way to ensure business continuity (Fleming, 2014). Towing trucks to the \n\ncompany™s facility in Corner Brook is expensive and time consuming; therefore, the company now \n\nstrategically leaves replacement parts in customers™ homes and businesses along its routes (Fleming, \n\n2014). When minor repairs are required (i.e. tires, springs, and lights), drivers contact the closest facility \n\nto request delivery or replacement of the appropriate parts. The company™s connections to local \n\ncommunities make this approach possible.\nGovernments are investing in proactive maintenance to reduce climate risks to transportation \n\n\nof rapid warming and snowmelt, the federal government invested $1.7 million in 2015 to proactively \n\nremove snow from the roadways of eight vulnerable First Nations communities. As many as 800 \n\ntruckloads of snow per day were removed from critical infrastructure (including roadways) in some \n\ncommunities. Regional snowfall in winter 2014 broke local records and contained higher-than-normal \n\n\n\nNorthern Development Canada, 2015).\n', ' 237CHAPTER 8: ATLANTIC CANADA\n 2375.0 RAIL TRANSPORTATION: IMPACTS AND ADAPTATIONS\n5.1 PAST IMPACTS AND FUTURE RISKS \nRail infrastructure in Atlantic Canada is affected by a changing climate and extreme weather in \n\n\nsurge, and ice jams) has resulted in impacts on both modes (Environment Canada, 2010), and \n\nsnowstorms that inundated roadways in St. John™s, Newfoundland in 1959 and Prince Edward Island in \n\n1989 also buried and stranded trains (Environment Canada (2013b). \nSTORM SURGE, COASTAL EROSION, AND SEA-LEVEL RISE\n\n\nwith storm surge and erosion, which can sometimes result in derailments. For example, in 2003 \n\nHurricane Juan resulted in 1.5-2 m storm surges at Halifax Harbour that severely eroded shoreline, \n\nwashed-out railway tracks (Figure 8), and washed several rail cars into the ocean at the Dartmouth \n\nrail yard (Bowyer, 2003a). Similarly, Hurricane Igor in 2010 caused rail-line damage, washout, and \n\nclosures Œ these were especially pronounced in Newfoundland (Curtis and Ehrenfeld, 2012).\nFigure 8: Debris on rail track at Dartmouth Point the morning after Hurricane Juan. \nRun-up was 1.64 m above the highest water level recorded at the Halifax tide gauge across the harbor, and water \nlevels remained unusually high at the time of photography.

Coastal \n\nerosion has resulted in damaged tracks, slower speeds, operational delays, and rail closures in Atlantic \n\nCanada, affecting the movement of goods such as paper, coal, lumber, petroleum products, and \n\nchemicals (Genesee and Wyoming, Inc., n.d.). These disruptions have negative impacts on local \n\n\n\n\nSlope failures in coastal areas have affected the Quebec North Shore and Labrador Railway (QNS & \nL) (Batterson et al., 1999; CBC News, 2014b), and will continue to pose risks in future (Spooner et al., \n\n2013; Evan et al., 2005).  Similarly, the Cape Jack section of the Cape Breton and Central Nova Scotia \n\nRailway (CBNS) has experienced severe erosion around coastal sections of track (Stephen Newson, \n\nProvince of Nova Scotia, personal communication, 2015; CBC News, 2014a).  \nLooking forward, an area of considerable concern is the Chignecto Isthmus, which is vulnerable to \n\n\nlevel rise (Webster et al., 2011)\n (Figure 9\n; see Case Study 5). \nFigure 9: CN Rail in the Chignecto Isthmus. \nEmbankments form part of the region™s dyke network. \n(Source: EOS Eco-Energy Inc.)\n', ' 239CHAPTER 8: ATLANTIC CANADA\n 239EXTREME PRECIPITATION\nThere are many documented incidents of heavy precipitation events affecting rail transport in \nAtlantic Canada. For example, on August 31, 2007, heavy rain caused a number of culverts to fail \n\nalong CBNS rail in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, as well as wash-outs along many sections. The track \n\nwas closed for approximately three weeks for repair and replacement, disrupting freight movement \n\n(Stephen Newson, Province of Nova Scotia, personal communication, 2015). In total, the incident cost \n\nthe railway more than $500,000 (Province of Nova Scotia, 2007a, 2007b).\n  In April 2003, culverts beneath a rail line in Ellershouse, Nova Scotia washed out during a large storm \n\nevent (Stephen Newson, Province of Nova Scotia, personal communication, 2015). Similarly a severe \n\n\n\nNew Brunswick, as extreme precipitation washed-out rail bridges and undermined rail beds \n\n(Environment Canada, 2013c).\n Future increases in the intensity, duration, and frequency of extreme \nprecipitation (Bush et al., 2014) would result in even more severe impacts.\nHeavy snow also disrupts rail movements in Atlantic Canada. For instance, snowstorms in Nova Scotia \nduring winter 2015 delayed the movement of goods and services by rail from multimodal facilities to \n\nNorth American markets, proving costly for operators (Henderson, 2015; Cuthbertson, 2015). Heavy \n\nsnow will continue to affect rail movements in Atlantic Canada, at least over the short term.\n ICE-JAM FLOODING8 have caused major damage to rail systems. \nFloods involving ice jams tend to be more damaging to infrastructure than open-water events, \n\n\nBrunswick, a series of ice jams on six rivers resulted in the destruction of 32\n bridges (both road and rail) \nand damage to 124 others (see Figure 10) (Government of New Brunswick, 2012).\nFigure 10: Spring ice jam at a rail bridge on the Saint John River. \n(Source: New Brunswick Power, 2015)\n8   An ice jam is a temporary ice blockage of a river, formed by the accumulation of ice fragments that build up to restrict the \n\n\n\n\n\nevents (Environment Canada, 2013a). \n', ' 240CHAPTER 8: ATLANTIC CANADA\n 240In April 1987, an ice jam caused the collapse of the Perth-Andover railway bridge, during a severe \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.

Hot and cold temperature extremes cause rail tracks to expand or contract, and \n\ncan lead to train derailments (Dobney et al., 2008; Peterson et al., 2008; Nova Scotia Department of \n\nTransportation and Infrastructure Renewal, 2014). Extreme summer heat can result in rails buckling as \n\nthey expand beyond reasonable design limits (Dobney et al., 2008), causing ﬁsun kinksﬂ. Historically \n\nthis has not been a common problem in the Atlantic provinces (Stephen Newson, Province of Nova \n\nScotia, personal communication, 2015). However, the region has experienced incidents caused by, \n\nor exacerbated by, rapid temperature changes. For example, the investigation into a derailment in \n\nPictou County, Nova Scotia in June 2014 indicated that track buckling ﬁproduced by a sudden and \n\n\n\n(Province of Nova Scotia, 2014). Extreme temperature change is also considered to have been a \n\nmajor factor in a main-track derailment in Milford, Nova Scotia in 2002 (Transportation Safety Board of \n\nCanada, 2003). The frequency of these events Œ and the probability of a serious accident Œ is likely to \n\nincrease as temperatures rise in the 21\nst century (Dobney et al., 2008).5.2 ADAPTATION PRACTICES\nWhile documented examples are limited, rail operators in Atlantic Canada have made efforts to \n\nreduce future climate risks.

(CWR, which has longer rail segments, \n\ngenerally reduces track maintenance costs and increases the average service life of rail components \n\nunder moderate temperature conditions). For example, following the June 2014 derailment in Pictou, \n\n300 feet of CWR from the point of derailment was replaced with 39-foot track panels that are easier to \n\n\n\nthe company conducted a stress test on the rail line, and employees reviewed rail maintenance \n\nrequirements. To prevent similar events in the future, the railway has developed a new technical \n\ntraining program, and train speeds have been restricted to 40 km/h during summer months and may \n\nbe further restricted to as low as 16 km/h when warranted by extreme heat conditions (Province of \n\nNova Scotia, 2014). \n6.0 MARINE TRANSPORTATION\n6.1 PAST IMPACTS AND FUTURE RISKS \nMarine transportation in Atlantic Canada has long been affected by adverse climate conditions \n\nand storms, disrupting operations and damaging vessels, ports, and navigation infrastructure. \n\nThese impacts are particularly challenging for Newfoundland and Labrador, which relies heavily \n\non marine transportation for resupply and connectivity (CBC News, 2015b, 2015c). Over the past \n\ncentury, improved forecasting and monitoring technologies have considerably reduced risks to \n\nmarine operators from extreme weather. However, ports and vessels remain vulnerable to a number \n\nof future risks associated with a changing climate. Lost productivity from weather-related disruptions \n\nin Atlantic Canada™s marine transportation sector is estimated to total millions of dollars annually \n\n(Catto et al., 2006).PRECIPITATION, EXTREME WEATHER, STORM SURGE, AND SEA-LEVEL RISE\nHurricanes have caused major damage to marine infrastructure and vessels in the past. During \n\nHurricane Juan,  storm surges of 1.5-2 m and wind gusts up to 230 km/h, \ndamaged coastal wharves and other port infrastructure in Halifax Harbour, blew containers off ships, snapped weather buoys, and sank \n\nand damaged vessels (Bowyer, 2003a Bowyer, 2003b).\n ﬁWhite Juanﬂ, a hurricane-force nor™easter in \n\n\ndamaged ports in Nova Scotia (Environment Canada, 2013a). In 1995, during Hurricane Luis, a 30 m \n\nwave struck an ocean liner off the coast of Newfoundland (Environment Canada, 2013b). \nRising sea levels and increased storm surge are also expected to pose greater risks over the course \nof the 21st century (Bush et al., 2014). Sea-level rise in the range of 70-100 cm is projected for many \nkey coastal locations in Atlantic Canada by 2100 (Savard et al., 2016); and in some cases, higher \n\ntides and storm surges could inundate and damage wharves, terminals, and loading equipment in \n\nthe absence of adaptive action (Andrey and Mills, 2003). Figures 12a and 12b illustrate the extent of \n\npossible inundation for Halifax Harbour in 2100, based on two sea-level rise scenarios (high- and low-\nprobability). In some locations sea-level rise could permit the entry of ships with greater drafts and \n\nheavier cargo loads (Andrey and Mills, 2003). \n', ' 242CHAPTER 8: ATLANTIC CANADA\n 242Figure 12b: Flooding extent/depth in Halifax Harbour associated with a 50-year return level event \nand a 1.3 m rise in global sea level (lower probability).  \nFor these projections, it is assumed that \nfrequency and intensity of storms remains unchanged in future.

When combined with \nearlier seasonal break-up and fragmentation of sea ice, winds pose additional navigation hazards. \n\nFor instance, in the winter of 2015, ice blown into the Strait of Belle Isle resulted in lengthy delays and \n\nfrustration for passengers attempting to travel between Newfoundland and Labrador (CBC News, \n\n2015b).

Data generated by SmartAtlantic buoys (Figure 14) is used \n\n\n\nThe technology is currently in use at seven Atlantic ports (see Case Study 4) and allows the \n\nmarine transportation industry, commercial and recreational boaters, researchers, and interested \n\nmembers of the public to access real-time, online data about regarding weather and directional \n\n\n\nnavigational safety, and to enhance the reliability of port operations in a variety of weather and \n\nclimatic conditions (Government of Canada, 2014; New Brunswick Department of Transportation \n\nand Infrastructure, 2015). \n', ' 245CHAPTER 8: ATLANTIC CANADA\n 245CASE STUDY 4: CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION AT PORT \nSAINT JOHNPort Saint John is Atlantic Canada™s largest port by tonnage. It connects global markets to central Canada \nby rail and road, and\n serves regionally-important industries\n such as potash, petroleum, and tourism (i.e. \nthe cruise industry). Climate-related impacts and disruptions to the port™s operations negatively affect \n\n\nnumber of risks to infrastructure and operations related to extreme, variable and/or changing climatic \n\nSea-level rise and storm surges pose increasing risks to port infrastructure, designed for a 100-year lifespan. \n\nIn late 2015-early 2016, Port Saint John experienced an unusually high number of strong wind events, \n\nproducing storm surges in the inner harbour. During one particularly strong event on October 29, 2015 \n\n(the peak of which coincided with an extra high tide), infrastructure sustained approximately $20,000 in \n\ndamages (Chris Hall, Port Saint John, personal communication, 2016).Several actions, implemented and planned by the Port as part of its modernization efforts, are expected to \nmake the port more resilient to variable and changing climatic conditions, and more reliable for shippers \n\nand mariners. For example, the ﬁSmartAtlanticﬂ inshore weather buoy was recently launched, along with a \nwave forecasting tool.\n Figure 15\n provides an example of the forecasting output from Saint John Harbour™s \nSmartAtlantic buoy. This data accurately predicted the storm-surge event on October 29, 2015.\nFigure 15: SmartAtlantic buoy output for Saint John Harbour (October 29, 2015). \n(Source: Chris Hall, Port Saint John) \nCASE STUDY 4–', ' 246CHAPTER 8: ATLANTIC CANADA\n 2467.0 AIR TRANSPORTATION\n7.1 PAST IMPACTS AND FUTURE RISKS\nPractitioners suggest that on the whole, airports in the Atlantic region are well-equipped to function \n\n\n\n\nlosses, and passenger inconvenience. Flight delays are especially problematic for Newfoundland \n\n(CBC News, 2015b, 2015c), which relies on aviation (as well marine transportation) for connectivity. \nAirports aim to keep facilities open in all weather conditions, especially for medical emergency \nservices that require the use of runways and airport facilities. The challenge for airports is to provide \n\n\n\nairports are particularly concerned with rising operating costs accompanying more variable \n\nand severe weather conditions (Helen MacInnis, J.A. Douglas McCurdy Sydney Airport, personal \n\ncommunication, 2015; Andrew Isbill, Fredericton Airport Authority, personal communication, 2015). \nPRECIPITATION AND STORMS\nPrecipitation, including rain, snow, and freezing rain on runways can compromise the friction and \n\n\n\nresponse to freezing rain events and extreme snowfall (Helen MacInnis, J.A. Douglas McCurdy Sydney \n\nAirport, personal communication, 2015). \n\nst century \ncould lead to further losses in revenue due to operational disruptions. These types of delays could also \nincrease operating costs, associated with requirements for more aircraft, facility maintenance and the \n\nimprovement of supporting infrastructure, such as access roads and drainage facilities (Transportation \n\nResearch Board, 2008). \nWhile storm surges, erosion and sea-level rise pose risks to regional coastal infrastructure, most airports \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncreased frequency of lightning storms and hurricanes are also a concern for some airports in Atlantic \nCanada, given their potential to disrupt operations and pose safety risks (for instance, by reducing \n\nvisibility during landing and take-off). While data to support the increasing frequency of these storms are \n\nnot captured in the historical record, Sydney airport has documented an increase in frequency over the \n\nshort term (Helen MacInnis, J.A. Douglas McCurdy Sydney Airport, personal communication, 2015). \nThe Port is also undertaking long-term planning for its infrastructure as part of a port modernization plan. A \npreliminary engineering study in support of these efforts explicitly accounted for future sea level rise, based \n\non high-resolution models for the Upper Bay of Fundy (Dupont et al., 2005). \n\n\n–', ' 247CHAPTER 8: ATLANTIC CANADA\n 247WIND \n\naircraft to safely take off or land (United Kingdom Department for Transport, 2014). Wind can also \n\ndamage equipment on the ground. For instance, in 2012, high winds tipped over an array (part of \n\nthe instrument landing system) at the J.A. Douglas McCurdy Sydney Airport in Nova Scotia, affecting \n\nlanding operations and requiring NAV CANADA to make unexpected and costly repairs (Helen \n\nMacInnis, J.A. Douglas McCurdy Sydney Airport, personal communication, 2015). \nPower outages accompanying windstorms can create major problems for air transportation. For \nexample, when Hurricane Arthur hit the Maritimes in the summer of 2014, Fredericton International \n\nAirport lost power and had to rely on a backup generator (Andrew Isbill, Fredericton Airport Authority, \n\npersonal communication, 2015). The generator allowed the airport to continue with some operations, \n\nalthough operators had concerns about its potential failure. More frequent high-intensity wind events \n\nwould increase risks associated with these impacts, although projections indicate that daily average \n\n\nTEMPERATURE \nAtlantic aviation is also vulnerable to changing temperatures. Increasing freeze-thaw cycles pose \n\nrisks to runway stability, while extreme heat and cold reduce aircraft engine performance and fuel \n\n\nIncreasing turbulence as a result of higher-temperature conditions (increased air density) is expected \n\n\njourneys spent in conditions of ﬁmoderate-or-greater turbulenceﬂ is likely to increase 40-170 percent \n\nby mid-century, resulting in longer trip times, greater fuel consumption, and more greenhouse-gas \n\nemissions (Williams and Joshi, 2013). \n7.2 ADAPTATION PRACTICES\nAdaptation actions at Atlantic airports are not well documented in the public domain. However, \n\nAtlantic aviation faces many of the same climate risks as operators in other Canadian jurisdictions \n\n(including extreme weather events and temperature extremes). Thus, many of the practices outlined \n\nin other chapters of this report apply to Atlantic Canada. General risk avoidance practices include \n\n\n\ninstrumentation systems. \n8.0 MULTI-MODAL RISK ASSESSMENTS AND COST-BENEFIT ANALYSES \nSome initiatives in Atlantic Canada have considered the vulnerability of the region™s transportation \n\n\n\nchange impacts and adaptation options for transportation infrastructure.\n8.1 RISK ASSESSMENTSIn 2012, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) completed an expert-based risk assessment \n\nof infrastructure, waterways, and biological systems in the Atlantic Large Aquatic Basin (LAB), \n\nwhich includes the Newfoundland Labrador Shelf, Scotian Shelf/Slope, and the Gulf of Maine \n\n\n\nrisks based on ﬁrisk exposureﬂ (vulnerability to impacts) on 10- and 50-year horizons. Risks relevant \n\nto transportation include increased demand for emergency services, infrastructure damage, and \n', ' 248CHAPTER 8: ATLANTIC CANADA\n 248changes to the navigability of waterways. Of these, it was determined that the greatest risks are \nposed to infrastructure by changing climate conditions over both timescales. Authors note that this \n\nassessment™s methodology can be applied to smaller-scale risk assessments of ports and coastal \n\ntransportation systems in Atlantic Canada.Public and private institutions are developing tools to assist in the assessment of climate change risks. \nFor example, the ﬁCoastaL Impact Visualization Environmentﬂ (CLIVE) tool, created in partnership \n\nby the University of Prince Edward Island (UPEI) and Simon Fraser University, offers a ﬁvirtual tourﬂ of \n\nlikely coastal erosion and storm-surge impacts on Prince Edward Island. CLIVE is operated by a game \n\n\n\n\n\nland area lost. This tool is useful for assessing transportation infrastructure vulnerability to coastal \n\nchanges in order to better plan for changes in maintenance, structure, or location over the short and \n\n\n8.2 COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS \n\n\n\n\ncosts of direct (damages) and indirect (disruptions and closures) climate impacts on transportation \n\n\n\nexpensive to build, and changing operational practices can cause short-term delays, confusion, and \n\n\n\nand adaptation options for the Chignecto Isthmus.CASE STUDY 5: ADAPTING TO FLOODING AND STORM-SURGE \n RISKS IN THE CHIGNECTO ISTHMUSThe Chignecto Isthmus is one of Canada™s most important transportation corridors, and the sole land \nbridge joining mainland Canada (New Brunswick) with Nova Scotia. Marsh areas within the Isthmus had \n\n\n\narea, including the Trans-Canada Highway, the CN Railway, and electricity-transmission lines serving Nova \n\nScotia.

First, there is an absence of vulnerability assessments and comprehensive data \n\n\n\n\n\nand ports are most and least vulnerable. In addition, for certain important weather conditions such \n\nas fog and wind, there is little relevant, published climate data and literature from which to draw \n\nconclusions. Wind and fog have major impacts on marine and air navigation in the Atlantic region, so \n\nfurther research could better inform planning and operations.  \nThe research conducted for this chapter also suggests that the risks to assets and operations posed \nby extreme weather events are more salient to public and private infrastructure managers than \n\nthose related to long-term changes in climate parameters (i.e. sea-level rise, increased ambient \n\ntemperatures). Greater attention is given by municipalities, practitioners, and infrastructure operators \n\n(i.e. Halifax Harbour, Port Saint John) to the increasing frequency of extreme weather events over \n\nother, longer-term impacts. This is not surprising, given limited public resources and the high costs \n\n\nLikely for this same reason, practitioners and researchers conducting risk assessments and adaptation \nplanning in Atlantic Canada acknowledge challenges in engaging stakeholders. The relevance of \n\n\n\n\nin the transportation sector, just one sector among many in Atlantic Canada considering how to \n\nadapt to emerging climate risks (Atlantic Climate Adaptation Solutions Association, 2016). Climate \n\nchange adaptation is a growing issue on the transportation agenda, and climate risks are spurring \n\ninvestment and planning. Practitioners are aware that the demand for transportation services will \n\nchange in response to physical damages and service disruptions caused by changing climate \n\nconditions, and actions taken to enhance economic access to new or expanded markets will alter \n\n\n\ninfrastructure through collaboration and adaptation will be important to reduce impacts and \n\n\n', ' 252CHAPTER 8: ATLANTIC CANADA\n 25210.0 ANNEXTables A1-A4: \nTemperature and precipitation projections by province for the Atlantic region up \nto 2100 over three time horizons (2016-2035, 2046-2065, and 2081-2100).

Redundancy becomes even more important \n\nin emergency situations (including those arising from extreme weather conditions) as it allows \n\ntravelers to complete trips, and economies to function, even when major service disruptions occur.\n \nEvents with severe socioeconomic impacts demonstrate to municipal decision-makers that human activity, \n\nshort-sighted planning decisions, or failure to act, can exacerbate weather-related damages.  \n\n\n\npolicy changes made in response to extreme weather events in some Canadian cities.\n ﬁLow-regretﬂ or ﬁno-regretﬂ adaptation strategies offer municipalities opportunities to enhance the \n\nresilience of transportation infrastructure at key points in infrastructure lifecycles, at little additional \n\ncost.\n\nprecipitation conditions, when existing infrastructure reaches a renewal period. These strategies \n\nand realized quickly.\n The cost of resilient infrastructure is considered a barrier to implementing adaptive actions. \nIn \n\n\npartnerships could help promote adaptation when addressing Canada™s growing municipal \n\n\n There is a need for structured collaboration among government departments, transportation \n\nagencies, emergency services, municipal councils, engineers, climate change specialists, and \n\ncivil society. Collaboration helps to ensure adaptation is a community-wide endeavour and \nhighlights key interdependencies for the urban transportation sector (for example, with electricity \n\nand telecommunications providers).\n Canadian cities are undertaking a number of resilience-enhancing initiatives. \nExamples from \nWhitehorse, Prince George, Toronto, and Moncton demonstrate the diversity of adaptive \n\nstrategies required to deal with the range of geographic and climatic challenges across the \n\ncountry. These case studies also suggest that, increasingly, urban practitioners are moving beyond \n\nrisk assessment and beginning to implement adaptive practices and build resilient infrastructure. \n', ' 267CHAPTER 9: URBAN 2671.0 INTRODUCTIONUrban transportation systems are vulnerable to both extreme weather events and the incremental \nimpacts of a changing climate. Extreme weather disrupts and delays urban travel by washing out \n\nroadways and transit routes, and by damaging the electrical and communications systems upon \n\nwhich these modes rely. Increased temperatures cause pavement rutting, buckling of rail lines, and \n\ndamage to infrastructure built on permafrost in Northern communities. These and other climate risks \n\n\nIn this chapter, urban transportation refers to all modes of transportation that carry people and \ngoods within cities and, more broadly, metropolitan areas. This includes infrastructure and vehicles \n\n(automobiles, buses), rail transit (including metros, light rail transit [LRT], and commuter rail), and \n\nactive modes, such as walking and cycling. Note that airports, regional and national rail systems, \n\nmarine ports, and ferry services3 are discussed in regional chapters of this report.  \nThe focus of this chapter is on the vulnerability \n\nof urban transportation to the impacts of both \n\ngradual changes in climate and extreme \n\nweather events, taking into account the \n\ninteractions between cities™ concentrated \n\ninfrastructure, services, and populations. The \n\nchapter also explores current efforts Canadian \n\nmunicipalities are making, and those planned \n\nfor the future, to increase transportation \n\nresiliency. While some of these adaptations can \n\n\n\nor ﬁlow-regretﬂ actions Œ strategies which involve \n\n\n\nor prevent higher future costs. Integrating \n\nclimate considerations into decision-making \n\nprocesses (i.e. mainstreaming), for example, \n\n\n\nmanagement processes, and infrastructure \n\ninvestment decisions, makes it easier to identify \n\nthis type of adaptation.Recognizing that research examining climate impacts on urban transportation is limited in Canada, \nthis chapter also draws upon relevant research from the United States, to supplement domestic \n\ncontent where appropriate.\n1.1 TRENDS IN URBAN CANADACanada is growing increasingly urban. In the 2011 national census, 81 percent of Canadians \n\nindicated that they lived within medium or large population centres.  Population trends suggest that \n\nthe nation™s largest urban areas Œ known as Census Metropolitan Areas (CMAs) Œ are growing rapidly, \n\n\n\nand development agencies, and tourists, as well as newcomers to Canada (Filion and Bunting, 2010). \n\nFigure 1 presents the population growth in Canadian CMAs from 2006-2011.\n3  Ferries provide important transit services only in a few urban centres in Canada (e.g., Halifax and Vancouver).\nStatistics Canada has recently replaced the term \nﬁurban centreﬂ with ﬁpopulation centre.ﬂ  There \n\nare three categories, including: \n Small population centres (with populations \n\nbetween 1,000 and 29,000); \n Medium population centres (between \n\n30,000 and 99,000); and, Large population centres (populations \n\nexceeding 100,000) (Statistics Canada, \n\n2011a). \nThis chapter primarily focuses on the last two \n\ncategories, although ﬁurban centresﬂ and \nﬁpopulation centresﬂ are used interchangeably.\n', ' 268CHAPTER 9: URBAN 268Figure 1: Canadian CMAs with the highest growth rates from the 2006 National Census to the 2011 \nNational Census. (Source: Statistics Canada)\nBoth large and mid-sized cities are leading the urbanization movement in Canada. While the greater \nmetropolitan areas of three cities (Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver) now account for 35 percent of \n\n\n\ngrowth as well (e.g., Saskatoon, Kelowna, and Moncton). This is a trend experts expect to continue \n\nwell into the 21st century. Thus, adapting to climate risks in Canadian cities will occur in tandem with \nmanaging urban population growth.\nThe degree to which Canadian cities will be affected by climate change and their capacities to \nadapt varies considerably. ﬁAdaptive capacityﬂ is a function of many factors, including geography. \n\nCMAs are distributed in a number of climate regions, including two in Canada™s north (Whitehorse, \n\n\n\nand thawing permafrost (see Chapter 3).\nCanada™s urban development in the postwar period has been characterized by low-density, \nsprawling suburban development outward from traditional downtown cores, which encourages (and \n\noften requires) the daily use of automobiles (Blais, 2013).  Road congestion is taking an increasingly \n\nheavy toll on Canadian urban regions, accounting for $6 billion to $11 billion in lost economic \n\nproductivity annually in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area, and $500 million to $1.2 billion \n\n\n\nDachis, 2015). However, many Canadian municipalities have begun to recognize the importance of \n\n\n\nenvironments (Ontario Ministry of Infrastructure, 2013; Metro Vancouver, 2011; Haider et al., 2013). \n\nAs a result, there is a general movement to build ﬁupﬂ rather than ﬁout,ﬂ and population density is \n\nincreasing along with population growth: in CMAs, population density increased by an average of 6 \n\npercent from 2006-2011 (Statistics Canada, 2011a; see Figure 2). \n', ' 269CHAPTER 9: URBAN 269Figure 2: Urban density and agglomerations in Canada.\n (Source: Statistics Canada)\nWhen assessing climate impacts on cities, density (of both population and infrastructure) is a \ncomplicating factor. Localized impacts, such as strong winds and heavy rainfall, disrupt a higher \n\n\n\nin urban centres than in less densely-populated areas (Revi et al., 2014; Solecki et al., 2011). \nThe deteriorating condition of municipal infrastructure further complicates the ability of Canada™s \nhighgrowth and increasingly dense cities to accommodate a growing population. The 2016 \n\nCanadian Infrastructure Report Card (CIRC), which assessed the condition of Canada™s municipally-\n\nowned infrastructure, graded 14 percent of sidewalks, roads, and bridges, as ﬁpoorﬂ to ﬁvery poorﬂ, \n\nwith a total replacement value of $50.4 billion. The CIRC provided these same grades to 17 percent \n\nof public transit infrastructure (vehicles, mobile technology, security systems, signalization equipment, \n\nand terminal facilities), with a replacement value of $9 billion (Canadian Infrastructure Report Card, \n\n2016).  The report indicated that under current investment/maintenance conditions, most urban \n\n\n\ninfrastructure presently in ﬁfairﬂ to ﬁvery goodﬂ condition (Canadian Infrastructure Report Card, 2016). \n\nThe pressure placed on this infrastructure by climate change is likely to expedite the need to replace \n\nor upgrade older assets.', ' 270CHAPTER 9: URBAN 270Transit ridership per capita in Canada is also growing annually (Canadian Urban Transit Association, \n2012), while rates of auto ownership in CMAs are decreasing (Perl and Kenworthy, 2010). Transit is \n\nattracting greater attention from all levels of government in Canada, with federal and provincial \n\nspending support for urban transit in Canada growing at a rate of 5.2 percent annually since 2008 \n\n(Transport Canada, 2013). This is consistent with a broader international trend in urban governance to \n\n\n\nhealth (Bradford, 2008). \nFinally, it is worth considering the interactions of multiple infrastructure systems in cities. Vehicles \nand at-grade rail systems rely heavily on drainage infrastructure to manage storm runoff. Rail transit \n\nnetworks in cities such as Calgary, Edmonton, Toronto, and Montreal depend on reliable electricity to \n\npower vehicles and communications networks. Vehicles and bus transit systems also rely on municipal \n\n\n\ncontext for this chapter, as both the public and private sectors in Canada are challenged to maintain \n\nor improve this array of interrelated urban infrastructure while simultaneously enhancing the resilience \n\nof transportation networks to changing climate conditions. \n1.2 ADAPTATION TO A CHANGING CLIMATE\nA number of strategies can be used to reduce the impacts of observed and anticipated changes in \n\nclimate and extreme weather on urban transportation systems. The strategies discussed in this chapter \n\nfall into the following general categories: Investing in more resilient materials, infrastructure, and operational practices for transportation \n\ninfrastructure; \n Improving redundancy within transportation networks Œ this refers to the availability of multiple \n\npaths or modes for urban travel with similar user costs; \n \n\nconditions; \n Improving land use policies and controls (e.g., zoning amendments or construction requirements in \n\nvulnerable areas); and \n Enhancing the resilience of communities to extreme weather and climate effects through social \n\nadaptations.2.0 CLIMATE AND URBAN TRANSPORTATION \nUnderstanding the historical interactions of climate, weather, and geography are important to \n\ndetermine how climate change will affect urban transportation in Canadian cities in the 21\nst century. \nLocation is an important factor in urban vulnerability to climate change, as many cities in Canada are \n\n\n\n\n\ninfrastructure damage as a result of a changing climate and more frequent extreme weather events \n\n(Revi et al., 2014). While today™s planning provisions often restrict development in vulnerable areas, \n\nthis legacy of urban vulnerability persists, and is heightened by increasing population densities. \n\nUnderstanding how cities have dealt with climate impacts in the past helps vulnerable cities make \n\ninformed decisions and investments, in order to adapt to emerging climate conditions. \nThis section provides an overview of climate and weather-related impacts on urban transportation \nin Canada, and projected climate conditions for the 21\nst\nclimate can be found in other chapters of this report.\n', ' 271CHAPTER 9: URBAN 2712.1 CLIMATE SENSITIVITY OF URBAN TRANSPORTATION\nMuch has been learned about how to adapt to severe weather across all modes of urban \ntransportation in Canada. Some examples are explored in this section.  \nREGINA CYCLONE, JUNE 1912The Regina Cyclone, which occurred on June 12\nth, 1912, remains the most destructive tornado in \nCanadian history. It killed 30 residents, left 2500 homeless, and resulted in $1.2 million (approximately \n\n$25 million in 2015 dollars4) in property and infrastructure damage (Environment Canada, 2013a; \n\n\n40 years to pay back the debts it incurred (Saskatchewan Archives Board, 2011). The loss of the \n\n\n\n\n\nand affecting cities across the country that relied on western grain (Martin, 2012;). \nIn the century since this event, emergency management and communication protocols have \n\n\ntravelers of impending threats), and urban building codes and materials are much more resilient to \n\nwind and rain (Martin, 2012). While the damage and disruption associated with a similar event would \n\nlikely be severe, the transportation and other infrastructure impacts of a tornado would not be as \n\ndevastating today thanks to more stringent building codes and improved materials (Martin, 2012).\nFRASER RIVER VALLEY FLOOD, SPRING 1948\nAn unusually rapid warming of a heavy mountain snowpack caused the Fraser River, in British \n\n\n\nhomeless and 10 dead (Robinson and Cruikshank, 2006). The estimated damage was $20 million \n\n(approximately $220 million in 2015 dollars) (Environment Canada, 2010). \nThe network of dykes set up to protect the urban areas of Chilliwack, Mission, and New Westminster \n\n\n\n\nand nearby highways, impeding vehicles, pedestrians, and two rail lines running through the town \n\n\n\n\n\nairports and key segments of highway and railway (Environment Canada, 2010).\n\nBetter regional coordination, emergency planning, and awareness have catalyzed municipal, \n\nprovincial, and federal governments to invest $300 million since 1948 to improve dykes and other \n\n\n\nadaptive capacity and resilience of these communities has been increased (McLean et al., 2007). \n\n\n\nclimate. \n4   All conversions of historical to contemporary dollar values in this chapter have been derived from the Bank of Canada™s \n\n\nhttp://www.\n.', ' 272CHAPTER 9: URBAN 272Figure 3: Flood of the Fraser River at Mission, 1948. \n(Source: Environment and Climate Change Canada)\nHURRICANE HAZEL, GREATER TORONTO AREA, OCTOBER 1954\nHurricane Hazel, which hit the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) in October of 1954, may be Canada™s \nbest-known weather-related urban disaster, and remains one of the most costly storms in the region™s \n\nhistory. A wet autumn season left Ontario™s soils supersaturated (Environment Canada, 2013a), \n\n\n\nkilled 81 people (Toronto and Region Conservation Authority, 2016). Damages totaled $100 million \n\n(approximately $900 million in 2015 dollars), half of which was spent replacing damaged or destroyed \n\ntransportation infrastructure (Robinson and Cruikshank, 2006). \n\n Many train routes were delayed or otherwise affected, and a CNR railcar was overturned \n(Environment Canada, 2013a). \n CNR reported a dramatic increase in train travel during the storm due to widespread road \n\n\n\naverage of 1,000 (Environment Canada, 2013a), demonstrating the importance of redundant \n\ntransportation options in maintaining mobility during extreme events. \n \n\nof these highways, in the storm™s peak, were under approximately 1m of water. \n A total of 40 bridges were damaged and 10 were de-commissioned. Many bridges serving key \n\narterials, including connections over the Don River, York Mills, and Bayview Avenue, were severed, \n\ncausing considerable social disruption (Environment Canada, 2013a).\nThe GTA took adaptive action after Hazel to address the hurricane™s immediate effects and reduce \n\n\n\npolicy and infrastructure decision-making. For example, the proposed location of Toronto™s Gardiner \n\nExpressway route was amended, elevating the roadway and setting it back further from the shore \n\nof Lake Ontario. This busy highway running through downtown Toronto, yet to be built in 1954, would \n', ' 273CHAPTER 9: URBAN 273have been almost entirely washed out by a hurricane of this magnitude if built as initially planned \n(Environment Canada, 2015). In Hazel™s wake, the City also placed greater emphasis on restoring \n\ntransit services in a timely manner to alleviate road congestion during and after emergencies \n\n(Environment Canada, 2015).\nHurricane Hazel also shifted decision-makers™ perspectives in Ontario. They no longer framed natural \ndisasters as ﬁacts of godﬂ Œ rather, an important and transformative link was made between weather-\n\nrelated damage and planning decisions (Henstra, 2011). Hazel prompted the Toronto and Region \n\nConservation Authority to make many policy changes that resulted in greater resilience to extreme \n\n \n\nwatercourses and prevented development in \n\nthese areas; \n Increased the amount of water-absorbing \n\ngreen space in the city; and,\n Improved watercourse management \n\ninfrastructure and techniques (Robinson and \n\nCruikshank, 2006). \nPrior to Hurricane Hazel, volunteer groups \n\ntypically led storm clean-up efforts in Ontario. \n\nHazel gave municipalities the impetus to \n\nleverage provincial and federal governments for \n\nresources to adequately prepare for and recover \n\nfrom extreme weather events (Robinson and \n\nCruikshank, 2006). \nFigure 4: Personnel of the Canadian Army \nclearing away debris in the aftermath of \n\nHurricane Hazel.

Greater than 100 mm \n\nof ice fell in more than 80 hours of precipitation, \n\nleaving over 4 million people without electricity, \n\n\n\ndisruptions. Electrical wires, utility poles and tree \n\nbranches blocked roadways, and power outages \n\n\n\nand public transit services were delayed and \n\ncancelled, while icy conditions caused accidents \n\nand made travel dangerous (Bertin, 1998).\n More \nthan 16,000 Canadian Forces personnel were \n\ndeployed to manage the aftermath; Environment \n\nCanada estimated the initial insurance claims to \n\nbe more than $1.5B, with a total exceeding $3 \n\nbillion (Environment Canada, 2013b).\nFollowing the ice storm, several measures were implemented based on the lessons learned. For example, \nthe province of Quebec adopted legislation requiring all municipalities to prepare emergency plans \n\nand created better communication between the provincial and municipal governments (Institute for \n\nCatastrophic Loss Reduction, 2016). Hydro-Quebec also took measures to prevent power outages such \n\nas reinforcing transmission towers, adding additional hydro lines and burying power lines (The Canadian \n\nPress, 2008). While these measures were largely focused on public health and safety, better emergency \n\nplanning, communications and electricity systems also support the resiliency of transportation systems.\nFigure 5: Fallen tree branches following the \nice storm. \n(Source: Environment and Climate \n\nChange Canada) ', ' 274CHAPTER 9: URBAN 274HURRICANE JUAN, HALIFAX, SEPTEMBER 2003\nCities in Atlantic Canada have also experienced severe impacts from extreme weather events, \nand climate models suggest the frequency of these events will increase in this region in the 21\nst century (AMEC Inc., 2011). Hurricane Juan, that struck Halifax on September 29th, 2003, was the \nmost destructive storm in the city™s history, due to effects of storm surge (temporary sea-level rise), \n\nintense flooding, and strong winds (Environment Canada, 2013a). Sustained wind speeds reached \n\na maximum of 160 km/h. Halifax Harbour experienced wind gusts up to 230km/h and storm surges \n\nof 1.5-2m, leading to severe shoreline erosion and the loss of railway tracks (Bowyer, 2003a). \n\nContainers were blown off ships in the port, and several rail cars were washed into the Atlantic \n\nat the Dartmouth rail yard (Bowyer, 2003c). The storm™s volatility and disruption to transportation \n\nservices contributed to the closure of businesses and schools for five days (Bowyer, 2003b). \n\nThe estimated cost of damages related to Hurricane Juan totaled $200 million (Environment \n\nCanada, 2013a). The event prompted decision-makers in Atlantic Canada to improve planning \n\nand preparation processes for extreme weather events: clearer channels were created for \n\ncommunication and coordination among provincial and local emergency response departments, \n\nand hurricane-specific training for emergency personnel was mandated in the immediate \n\naftermath (Government of Nova Scotia, 2003).\nFigure 6: Storm surge causes wharf damage in Halifax Harbour. \n(Source: Environment and Climate \nChange Canada)', ' 275CHAPTER 9: URBAN 275FLOODING, GREATER TORONTO AREA, JULY 2005 AND JULY 2013\nSeveral extreme summer storm events have caused substantial disruption and damage to the Greater \n\n(insurance covered the additional $500 million in damages) (McLeod, 2011).

These include:\n Greater variation and extremes in seasonal and annual air temperature; \n Changing precipitation patterns; \n Increasing intensity and duration of wind speed, particularly during storm events;\n Changing patterns of sea and lake ice; \n Increasing permafrost degradation; \n Changing water levels, along both coastal and inland waterways; and, Combinations of these changing climate elements. \n', ' 277CHAPTER 9: URBAN 277AIR TEMPERATURE\n\n\n\nextreme heat and decreasing frequency of extreme cold (Bush et al., 2014). In cities, these trends are \n\nexacerbated by the urban heat-island effect, referring to the difference between surface and air \n\n\n\nareas. The heat island effect occurs due to a combination of factors (Figure 9), including: \n The lack of vegetation in cities (which regulates temperature);\n \n The high heat-absorbance of urban materials (e.g., black asphalt) Œ highly-developed areas have \n\nless surface moisture available for evapotranspiration (which cools surrounding air) than natural \n\nground cover, due to impervious surfaces like pavement and concrete (75-100 percent cover in \n\nmost cities); Anthropogenic (human-caused) heat production (e.g., air conditioning, vehicles, industrial \n\nactivities); and, \n Urban topography (e.g., narrow streets limit the capacity of buildings to radiate heat at night and \n\nlimit the passage of cooling winds) (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2008). \nUrban heat islands have implications for the integrity of transportation infrastructure, particularly \n\npavement. Figure 10 provides an example of an urban heat island map for Montreal, Quebec. \n\nThe impacts of heat waves tend to be greater \nin urban, rather than suburban or rural areas, likely owing to the ‚heat island™ effect.

Precipitation is expected to increase in all seasons across most of Canada, with the \n\nexception of a summer decline in the southwest (Bush et al., 2014). Figure 11 shows changes in \n\nprecipitation patterns in Canada over the last 59 years.\nFigure 11: Changes in precipitation in Canada, 1950-2009. \n(Source: Environment and Climate \nChange Canada)', ' 279CHAPTER 9: URBAN 279WINDChanges in patterns of wind relate to temperature and precipitation trends and extremes. One study \nsuggests that the intensity of average daily wind speed will increase by 10-30 percent across Canada \n\nby the late 21st century, compared to baseline conditions in the period from 1955-2009 (Cheng et al., \n2014). However, the extent of these changes remains uncertain. \nLAKE, RIVER, AND SEA ICEChanging patterns of lake, river, and sea ice pose risks to urban regions next to watercourses \n\nand oceans. The extent and seasonal duration of inland ice is likely to decrease as winters warm; \n\n\n\nmanagement on rivers and lakes (Bush et al., 2014). For example, in spring 2015, this phenomenon \n\nprompted the emergency evacuation of Perth-Andover, New Brunswick (see Chapter 8) (Canadian \n\nPress, 2015a).\nFigure 12: Ice jam prompts evacuation order in Perth-Andover in spring 2015. \n(Source: Perth-Andover \nFire Department)\nWATER LEVELS\n\n\n\n\nexperience sea level rise, much of the northern coast will experience relative sea-level decline due \n\nto a phenomenon known as ﬁglacial isostatic rebound,ﬂ in which land formerly covered by glaciers \n\nslowly decompresses and rises (Atkinson et al., 2016).

For example, \nareas traditionally challenged by snowfall may face increased freezing rain and black ice.\n2.3 CLIMATE RISKS TO URBAN TRANSPORTATION\nRoadways, rail transit systems, and active transportation networks are vulnerable to climate risks \n\nand extreme weather in two key ways. First, operations can be disrupted by extreme weather \n\nevents and obstructed rights-of-way, as described in Section 2.1. Second, infrastructure is structurally \n\nand physically vulnerable to the increasing range of some climate variables (i.e. temperature \n\nand precipitation) expected under future conditions. Infrastructure may be exposed to weather \n\nextremes unaccounted for in original engineering designs, which assumed that past climate extremes \n\naccurately represent future conditions (see Box). Severe weather and shifting ﬁaverageﬂ conditions \n\ncan therefore shorten infrastructure life spans, reduce performance, and increase maintenance and \n\noperating costs (McLeod and Stevanovic-Briatico, 2014). The following sections provide an overview \n\nof climate impacts to urban transportation systems summarized in Table 1.\nREGULATORY VULNERABILITIES:  CODES, STANDARDS, AND RELATED INSTRUMENTS (CSRI)\n\nof engineering and land-use standards might be termed ﬁregulatory vulnerability.ﬂ A survey of case \n\nstudies which used the Public Infrastructure Engineering Vulnerability Committee (PIEVC) Engineering \n\nProtocol\n5 considered the role codes, standards and related instruments (CSRI) play with respect to \nresilient infrastructure (Engineers Canada, 2012). The survey found that some jurisdictions apply national \n\n\n\ngeography and risk-tolerance preferences. The report concluded that adopting a ﬁclimate adjustment \n\nfactorﬂ into CSRI at the national level may not revolutionize local practices, but the authors suggest \n\nthat frequent updates based on climate model projections would assist practitioners in adapting their \n\nCSRI. Other inputs to CSRI, including professional judgment and management direction based on local \n\nconditions; accepted practices of the era; maintenance, operability, and procurement considerations; \n\nand other social, environmental, and economic factors, were considered robust in Canada (Engineers \n\nCanada, 2012).5   The PIEVC Engineering Protocol, led by Engineers Canada, was developed as a 5-step process to analyze the \nengineering vulnerability of individual infrastructure systems based on current climate and future climate projections. \n\nFurther information can be found at \nhttp://pievc.ca/. ', ' 281CHAPTER 9: URBAN 281 3.0 URBAN ROAD INFRASTRUCTURE\n\n\ninfrastructure (culverts, ditches, etc.). While per capita vehicle-km travelled (VKT) in Canadian cities \n\nis modestly declining (Perl and Kenworthy, 2010), roadways remain critically important to urban \n\neconomies for the movement of both freight and passengers. This is particularly the case in cities \n\nwithout strong transit links between urban centres and outlying suburban communities. \nPRECIPITATION \nPrecipitation affects urban roads and bridges in a variety of ways. Washouts (due to soil/slope \n\n\n\ndetours, and closures that reduce mobility and increase travel times for both automobiles and bus \n\ntransit (United States Federal Highway Administration, 2015; Andrey and Mills, 2003). High-intensity \n\n\n\nroadway disruptions when runoff volumes exceed the capacity of culverts and runoff ponds, and \n\noverwhelm the permeability of construction materials, reducing road safety (increasing the risk of \n\naccidents), and increasing the risk of bridge scour (Andrey and Mills, 2003; Transportation Research \n\nBoard, 2008; Revi et al., 2014). For example, on May 29, 2012 in Montreal, 45 mm of rain fell in under an \n\n\nWhile the proportion of snow as winter precipitation is likely to decline throughout Canada over the 21\nst century (Bruce, 2011), extreme winter storms producing heavy snowfall will continue to disrupt roadways \n\n\nwhen heavy snowfall caused buses to lose traction and become stuck (CTV News, 2013). Freezing rain is likely to become more frequent in many parts of Canada (Cheng et al., 2011), causing \nice build-up, road blockages, and power outages due to fallen tree branches and utility lines, and \n\nposing risks to road safety in urban areas (Andrey, 2010; Andrey et al., 2013). Increased salt usage to \n\ncombat icy road conditions corrodes concrete infrastructure, and carries negative implications for the \n\nwell-being of roadside ecosystems and urban water supplies (McLeod and Stevanovic-Briatico, 2014).\nTEMPERATURE \nClimate-induced stress to pavement mixtures is a growing issue for road operators. While most asphalt \n\n\n\nprojected temperatures for many Canadian cities in the 21\nst century exceed this range. In extreme \n\n\nincrease in frequency and severity (Mills and Andrey, 2002). Softening and rutting occur when vehicles \n\ndepress hot pavement (Mills et al., 2009). Bleeding refers to asphalt moving above a pavement™s \n\n\n\nmovement of asphalt to the fringe of the surface treatment, though not beyond the aggregate \n\nseal. While bleeding leads to more serious roadway damage, both phenomena reduce pavement \n\nintegrity (Texas Department of Transportation, 2006). Softened pavement also leads to reduced \n\nmaximum loads on municipal roadways, reduced ride quality and vehicle performance, increased \n\nmaintenance costs, and reduced lifespan of roads, bridges, and culverts (McLeod and Stevanovic-\n\nBriatico, 2014). In extreme heat, trucks and buses wear more heavily on roads than automobiles due \n\nto their more substantial chassis and passenger loads, exacerbating pavement rutting and shearing \n\nissues (Savonis et al., 2008). \nExtreme heat also produces heat stress for construction workers (Transportation Research Board, \n2008); on especially hot summer days, it may not be safe or possible to carry out construction work \n\nduring peak daytime hours (United States Federal Highway Administration, 2015).', ' 282CHAPTER 9: URBAN 282Bridge infrastructure is also vulnerable to extreme heat. Bridges are designed to withstand some \n\n\nHowever, as temperatures increase, the limits of these expansion joints can be exceeded, displacing \n\n\n\nlead to substantial bridge deterioration, resulting in closures and lengthy detours (Cohen et al., 2005). \n\n\n\nand Stevanovic-Briatico, 2014). \nAs seasonal temperature patterns shift, the frequency of freeze-thaw cycling is likely to increase \nthroughout Canada, and the timing and onset of freeze-thaw events are likely to change, with \n\nimplications for road infrastructure (Transportation Research Board, 2008). During periods of thaw, \n\nmoisture seeps into small cracks, freezes and expands when cold returns, and melts (causing \n\npavement weakness) during the next thaw (United States Federal Highway Administration, 2015). As \n\na result, pavement is more likely to experience shearing (cracking) and rutting, reducing the strength \n\nand stability of roadways (Transportation Research Board, 2008; United States Federal Highway \n\nAdministration, 2015). In northern climates, freeze-thaw cycling and temperature increases also \n\ncontribute to further permafrost degradation, which poses risks to the stability of urban roads and their \n\nembankments (Woudsma et al., 2007; Transportation Association of Canada, 2010).\nCHANGING WATER LEVELS\nBridge scour, which refers to the removal of supportive sand and rock sediment around bridges \n\nconstructed over waterways (Transportation Research Board, 2008), has affected many Canadian \n\n\n\npose erosion risks to coastal highways Œ this is particularly problematic in Atlantic Canada and British \n\nColumbia (AMEC Inc., 2011). Vancouver was recently named the 15\nth most-vulnerable city in the world \nto sea level rise, with likely impacts to road infrastructure by 2100 (at which point 1.1m of sea level rise \n\nis anticipated).  These impacts include inundation, erosion, and washing-out of low-lying downtown \n\nstreets (Mills, 2016).\nWINDData suggest the intensity of wind gusts (on average and during extreme events) is likely to increase \n\nover the 21st century in Canada (Cheng et al., 2008), although with considerable regional variability \n(Cheng et al., 2014). Fallen debris (i.e. power lines, trees, and branches) from high winds can obstruct \n\nroadways, sidewalks, and cycling pathways (City of Montreal, 2015), while blowing snow disrupts \n\nvisibility in winter months (Andrey et al., 2013). Strong winds may also temporarily close bridges Œ for \n\ninstance, the Burlington Skyway near Hamilton, Ontario is closed when winds reach or exceed 85km/h \n\n(Craggs, 2014). \nWILDFIRE\n\nparticularly in Canada™s drier, western regions (i.e., the Prairies and British Columbia). Recent research \n\n\nst\nagencies in both coastal and temperate areas may need to adapt their planning and response \n\n\n\ntransportation, particularly for emergency response planning. For example, during the catastrophic \n\n\n\nof residents by road, despite the availability of only a handful of exit routes out of the town (which \n\nquickly became congested) and thick smoke. This success was attributed to planning and coordination \n\namongst municipal departments and emergency personnel prior to the crisis (KPMG, 2012).', ' 283CHAPTER 9: URBAN 283OPPORTUNITIES\nThere are also opportunities for road transport associated with climate change. In southern cities, for \ninstance, construction seasons are likely to be longer, and winter road-maintenance costs are likely to \n\nbe lower in warmer winters, despite an increasing proportion of freezing rain (Andrey and Mills, 2003; \n\nFu et al., 2009). It remains to be seen, however, what impact increased freeze-thaw cycling might \n\nhave on these cost savings.4.0 URBAN RAIL TRANSPORTATION \nUrban rail systems include subways, LRT, and streetcars. They also include urban freight systems, \n\nalthough information on the regional and national rail system can be found in the regional chapters \n\nof this report.\n\nwell-used LRT and subway systems in Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Montreal, and Toronto. Other \n\n\n\nrapid transit. For example, the City of London is in the public consultation and mode-selection phase \n\nfor rapid transit, and Victoria is in the planning stages of bringing LRT to its metropolitan area. These \n\nprojects demonstrate renewed public interest in, and support for, rapid transit in general and rail-\n\nbased modes in particular.\n Toronto:\n Eglinton Crosstown LRT and Scarborough subway extension (construction phase);\n Kitchener-Cambridge-Waterloo:\n ION LRT (construction phase);\n The Greater Toronto and Hamilton area:\n\n\nand, Ottawa: Confederation Line LRT (construction phase).\nPRECIPITATION \nMany urban rail systems rely on municipal electricity grids; therefore, locomotives and signals are \n\nvulnerable to power outages in extreme weather conditions (i.e. rainfall and snow). Track beds are \n\nalso subject to a number of the same climate impacts as urban roadways, including reduced stability \n\n\nAs with roads, precipitation can overload the stormwater management infrastructure that protects \n\n\ninundation of rail systems, as was the case in Toronto in the summer of 2013 (Wooler, 2004). Extreme \n\nprecipitation in Montreal during May 2012 (discussed in Section 3) also resulted in tunnel closures and \n\nthe evacuation of several metro stations (City of Montreal, 2015).\nTEMPERATURE \nRail infrastructure is prone to buckling in extreme heat, increasing the potential for sensor \n\nmalfunctions, scheduling delays, speed restrictions, and Œ in extreme cases Œ derailment (Savonis et \n\nal., 2008). Tunnels used in underground rail transit systems can also experience operational challenges \n\nduring extreme heat, including mechanical issues with ventilation. As a result, operators need to \n\n\n\nMeteorological Services and Supporting Research (OFCM), 2002). \n', ' 284CHAPTER 9: URBAN 284Extreme cold also affects urban rail. For instance, the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) subway system \nfaced several extreme-cold power outages in the winter of 2015, due primarily to broken water \n\n\n\nfrozen track signal switches, delaying trains (Canadian Press, 2015b). However, this may become less \n\nproblematic in southern cities if the frequency of cold days and nights decreases as projected (Bush \n\net al., 2014).CHANGING WATER LEVELS AND STORM SURGE\n\n\nmay be inundated, washed-out, or eroded. Bridge scour is also a risk for rail bridges, as suggested by \n\nCalgary™s experience in the summer of 2013 (see Section 2.1).WIND \nHigh-intensity wind events also pose risks to rail infrastructure and operations, such as damage to \n\noverhead cables and tall signalization equipment, and rail-car blow-over (OFCM, 2002). Similar to \n\nroads, rail lines may also be obstructed by fallen debris causing service delays. \nOPPORTUNITIES\nInvestment in rail transit can enhance the redundancy of urban transportation networks, providing mass \n\ntransit options when roads are closed, unsafe, or congested (Box 1).  Rail transit projects could also \n\n\nBOX 1: REDUNDANCY IN URBAN TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS\nRedundancy is one method to enhance the resiliency of transportation networks to extreme weather and a \nchanging climate. A redundant system allows travelers choices so that even when major service disruptions \n\noccur (e.g., extreme congestion or wash-out), other options are available, and travelers can complete \ntheir trips and economies can continue to function. For example, in major cities like Montreal and Toronto, \n\n\non public buses. An opposite example is the nearly singular reliance of travelers in the Greater Toronto and \n\nHamilton Area on Highway 401 for travel between Toronto and points east and west. If Highway 401 were \n\ntimes and reliability. \nImproving redundancy does not mean building additional roads, particularly above the level of current \ndemand in corridors. In North American history, the construction of extra roads has often stimulated latent \n\naddress issues associated with urban sprawl (Duranton and Turner, 2011).  \n', ' 285CHAPTER 9: URBAN 2855.0 ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION\nWalking and cycling networks are critical to the movement of people within Canadian cities. Public \ntransit users, cyclists, and auto travelers are all pedestrians at some stage in their journeys, and \n\npedestrian and cycling facilities provide the most reliable forms of connectivity within cities. Active \n\nmodes have increasingly been a focus of investment at the municipal level in Canada, addressing \n\nclimate change concerns from both mitigation and adaptation perspectives (Younger et al., 2008; \n\n\n\nin municipal planning documents, these modes are also becoming more attractive for short trips as a \n\n\nActive transportation modes also offer an important form of redundancy to urban transportation \nnetworks (Box 1). Walking and cycling offer a ﬁsafety net,ﬂ permitting travel when mechanized \n\n\n\nhealth, relative insensitivity to climate change impacts, and low capital costs and environmental \n\nimpacts, many cities in Canada (and globally) are increasingly investing in these modes.\nPRECIPITATION \nActive transportation systems face many of the same vulnerabilities as roadways in terms of \n\npavement degradation, storm-water management issues related to runoff and permeability, and \n\n\n\nand bicycle lanes next to urban roadways, which make up the majority of active transportation \n\ninfrastructure in Canada (Transport Canada, 2011). \nThere tends to be a modal shift away from walking and cycling during precipitation events Œ all forms \nof precipitation reduce the proportion of trips taken by active modes (Koatse and Rietveld, 2009). \n\nSimilarly, pedestrian safety decreases in bad weather, with the number of outdoor injuries increasing \n\ndramatically in response to winter precipitation (including snow, rain, and freezing rain) (Morency et \n\nal., 2012). However, active transportation remains an important form of redundancy. Travelers are \n\nlikely to walk in poor weather conditions if roads or transit lines are incapacitated, which means the \n\n\n\nRietveld, 2009; Sabir et al., 2010).   \nTEMPERATURE \nExtreme temperatures also affect the use of active modes. Walking and cycling on hot days requires \n\nmore exertion and may pose health risks, particularly to vulnerable populations (such as the elderly) \n\n(Younger et al., 2008), a phenomenon worsened by the urban heat island effect (see Section 2.2).  \n\nSome research (i.e. Sabir et al., 2010) suggests that during extreme cold, cyclists shift to public transit \n\nand walking, while the opposite is true during periods of extreme warm weather. However, other \n\nresearch (i.e. Koatse and Rietveld, 2009) has found that both extremely high and low temperatures \n\nare likely to reduce cycling activity.\nCHANGING WATER LEVELS AND STORM SURGE\nAs with roadways, walking and bicycle paths (especially along coastal roads, or in ocean-side parks) \n\nare at risk of inundation and wash-out due to sea-level rise and storm surge (Mills, 2016). \n', ' 286CHAPTER 9: URBAN 286WIND \nActive transportation infrastructure tends to be less vulnerable to structural impacts than road \n\n\nwalkways and bikeways, as well as signage, can be damaged by high winds during extreme weather \n\nevents (OFCM, 2002). Strong winds are also associated with lower levels of cycling (Koatse and \n\n\n\nfalling debris.OPPORTUNITIES\nWarmer winters with less snow in many Canadian cities will provide longer seasonal access to walking \n\nand cycling infrastructure.

In Canada, federal, provincial and territorial policy \n\nframeworks and funding programs can support municipal adaptation efforts, while both public and \n\n\n\nmore variable weather and climate conditions.\nSharing knowledge about resilient infrastructure and operational practices is also critical. At the \nmunicipal level, there are a number of networks for climate adaptation knowledge-sharing, including \nICLEI Canada (Local Governments for Sustainability). ICLEI Canada™s Building Adaptive and Resilient \n\nCommunities (BARC) initiative (Box 2) is an interactive web-based tool designed to help local \n\ngovernments identify and adopt climate adaptation strategies. Member municipalities receive one-\n\non-one staff support for using the tool (ICLEI, 2010), and transportation is a key aspect of this program.\nBUILDING ADAPTIVE AND RESILIENT COMMUNITIES (BARC) INITIATIVE \n\n Initiate\n Research\n, which involves determination of likely climate changes and risk assessment; \n Plan, in which adaptation objectives, actions, and budgeting are undertaken; \n Implementation\n Monitor/Review, in which the effectiveness of action is determined, successes are communicated, and \nrevisions are made (ICLEI, 2010). \n\nintervention, as per the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (2014).\nDISASTER RISK-MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES\nThese strategies are familiar to municipalities, and have helped many cities successfully reduce \n\nthe impacts of severe weather events in the past (e.g., Halifax and Hurricane Juan, Slave Lake and \n\n\n\nor expected climate-related impacts, and assessing organizational risk through programming and \n\nsoftware applications; and others.

Municipalities increasingly \n\nrecognize that by considering land-use and transportation at the same time, vulnerability to changing \n\nenvironmental conditions may be reduced (Larrivée, 2010).\nSTRUCTURAL AND PHYSICAL ADAPTATIONS \nPerhaps the most tangible adaptation category, these strategies include engineering-based \n\nsolutions to enhance the physical resiliency of urban transportation networks. To adapt to more \n\nfrequent and intense rainfall events, practitioners may widen road culverts, shoulders, and ditches to \n\n\n\nand rails (Savonis et al., 2008). Flood risks due to sea level rise and storm surge can be mitigated by \n\n\n\nareas to protect roads and highways (AMEC Inc., 2011; Mills, 2016).\nTo adapt to changing temperatures, municipalities may employ alternative, more heat- and rut-\nresistant pavement materials, as well as rut-resistant pavement designs (i.e. thinner surfaces) (Andrey \n\nand Mills, 2003; United States Federal Highway Administration, 2015). For example, the Ontario Ministry \n\nof Transportation™s ﬁSuperPaveﬂ system is a materials selection system that uses local weather-station \n\ndata and pavement-performance data to dictate appropriate heat- and rutting-resistant asphalt \n\nmixes for provincial highways and some municipalities in Ontario (Ontario Ministry of Transportation, \n\n\n\nintelligent transportation system (ITS) infrastructure, to reduce risks from heat (City of Toronto, 2011). \nFor transportation infrastructure built on warming permafrost in northern cities, adaptation strategies \ninclude mechanical stabilization of embankments and the removal of permafrost before construction; \n\nhowever these methods are extremely costly (Cheng, 2005; United States Arctic Research Commission \n\nTask Force, 2003). Snow sheds, air ducts, and thermosyphons can also protect roads and rail lines from \n\nwarming temperatures (Reimchen et al., 2009). Dawson City has installed light-coloured pavement \n\n\n\npermafrost (Walsh et al., 2009).\nOther structural/physical adaptations include: Installing backup power infrastructure for overhead electricity (i.e. for trolleybuses, streetcars) and \nsignals (McLeod and Stevanovic-Briatico, 2014). \n \n\n\n\nForce, 2014).\n \n\nsubways (McLeod and Stevanovic-Briatico, 2014).', ' 291CHAPTER 9: URBAN 291 Performing regular maintenance of stormwater management systems, especially culverts, to \nmaintain capacity, and designing drainage systems to direct runoff away from the roadbed \n\n(rather than parallel with the roadway), therefore avoiding erosion of the roadbed and exposure \n\nof utilities (City of Toronto, 2014).\n \n\nculvert/ditch capacities (United States Federal Highway Administration, 2015).

Other impacts to urban transportation include increased frequency of freeze-thaw cycles\n; strain \non the road-maintenance budget in high-snowfall winters; and, greater stress on culverts due to increased \nsummer and winter precipitation.\nTo address these concerns, the City of Whitehorse participated in the development of the community-\nbased Whitehorse Climate Change Adaptation Plan in 2011 (Hennessey and Streicker, 2011). This project \n\ninvolved a diversity of community stakeholders. While not legally-binding (the document is policy-relevant, \nbut not policy-determinate) the plan has helped to ﬁmainstreamﬂ the changing climate into municipal \ndecision-making processes, meaning that climate data and projections are incorporated into investment \n\nand planning decisions.

Suggested \nadaptations for urban transportation include: Establishing annual budgets aimed at managing climate change concerns, including planning for \nincreased snow removal requirements; \n Expanding the use of road monitoring stations; \n Conducting exploratory feasibility studies of automatic road de-icing techniques; and\n Increasing the porosity of road surfaces to improve re-charge following precipitation. \nThese adaptations include both ﬁlow-regretﬂ and ﬁno-regretﬂ measures. For example, when road \nimprovements are required due to the lifecycle or condition of the infrastructure, the Plan suggests that \n\n\nmodest marginal-cost increase to the budget for the project. At the same time, this strategy means only \n\nthose roads nearing the end of their lifespan or in very poor repair will be adapted in the near-term, given \n\nthat the cost of replacing usable infrastructure with larger drainage capacity is prohibitive.

Feedback \n\nfrom practitioners involved in the implementation process highlighted four key areas for attention, with \n\n\n1. Building and maintaining local knowledge and capacity for decision-making around climate \n\nadaptation; \n2. ﬁMainstreamingﬂ or normalizing adaptation into the plans, priorities, and professional practices of local \n\n\n3. Focusing on tangible projects around which the community can rally and easily identify results; and; \n4. Linking adaptation actions to costs and priorities through clear communication to both politicians and \n\nmembers of the public (Picketts, 2014). \nCASE STUDY 4–', ' 301CHAPTER 9: URBAN 301This case study demonstrates how communities can successfully incorporate rigorous climate analysis \n\n\nexplicit actions (Picketts, 2013). Achieving greater teamwork and the adoption of common goals within \n\nthe municipal organization were also considered critical to sustaining the momentum this initiative has \n\ngenerated.1\n1  \n-sion in a forthcoming issue of Regional Environmental Change\n.–CASE STUDY 5:  ACCOUNTING FOR CLIMATE CHANGE RISKS \nAT TRANSLINK\nTransLink is metropolitan Vancouver™s regional transportation authority, with a system of assets and services \nthat incorporates bus, commuter rail, cycling and walking paths, and roads. This network provides about \n1.2 million trips per day.  The organization considers managing climate change risks important to service delivery and infrastructure \n\nmaintenance/development, particularly given that it builds infrastructure to last 100 years. Projected \n\npopulation growth in the region is expected to compound these risks Œ Metro Vancouver is expected to grow \n\nby one million people over the next 30 years, placing greater demand on the region™s transportation system. \nTransLink began considering climate change impacts in 2010 and conducted a climate change \nvulnerability assessment of its assets in 2012 in support of its Asset Management Plan. Through this process, \n\n Sea level rise, that could:   -\n -Reduce clearance under bridges -Impair operations of the SeaBus (ferry) terminal.\n \n\n Warmer temperatures, and more frequent and severe heat waves, that could affect passenger health \nTransLink has also ensured that its Finance department and accountants play a core role in its adaptation \n\n\nin TransLink™s decision-making process.\n TransLink considers this structure effective as it embeds climate \nchange throughout the organization, with links to risk management, strategic sourcing, capital planning \n\nand review processes, and reporting.\n\nCase Study #222  CPA (2015) Adaptation Case Study #2: TransLink Sector: Transportation.

Growing dependence on the electrical grid for urban mobility \n(particularly for LRT and commuter rail systems, but also for automobiles and infrastructure) can \n\ncreate multi-sectoral vulnerability when extreme weather events disrupt the supply and distribution of \n\n\n\nweather is another concern.  \n\nmanagement, also depend upon telecommunications infrastructure that can be affected by extreme \n\nweather (Revi et al., 2014). Without adequate coordination, interactions between water mains and \n\nunderground public transit systems can potentially disrupt both sectors. This is the case under both \n\nslow-onset climate change and during extreme weather events. For example, pipes can freeze \n\nand rupture during freeze-thaw cycles or extreme cold conditions damaging the water distribution \n\ninfrastructure and disrupting the underground public transit systems. This has been experienced by the \n\nToronto Transit Commission™s subway system in recent winters (McLeod and Stevanovic-Briatico, 2014).\nThe ability of transportation agencies to reduce damages associated with severe weather is therefore \naffected by how other municipal divisions and utility providers (e.g., telecommunications and energy \n\nsupply) integrate climate change considerations into their own planning and service delivery. If one \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn locations where infrastructure is at risk of being compromised or failing as a result of climate \nimpacts, Business Continuity Planning becomes important. This refers to planning that ensures services \n\nare not compromised by extreme or unforeseen events. Planning in advance how the workforce can \n\nbe more effectively deployed in emergency and post-emergency situations is critical, particularly \n\nsince climate change is anticipated to bring more frequent extreme weather events. Practitioners \n\ninterviewed for this chapter indicated that interdepartmental coordination can be improved if \n\ndecision-makers work closely with city engineers and technical advisory committees on climate \n\nadaptation strategies for transportation infrastructure and operations. \nFor example, the City of Toronto™s Transportation Services Division (TSD) has collaborated with a \nnumber of other municipal sectors and agencies on climate change adaptation and preparedness \n\n\n\nby TSD include power outages caused by extreme heat, wind, and freezing rain, as well as impacts \n\n\n\nthat a climate change risk assessment of the electricity sector would help to identify areas of the City \n\nmost vulnerable under various climate scenarios. This information would inform the implementation \n\nand spatial deployment of adaptation measures, such as uninterruptable power supply technology to \n\n\nDisruptions to road and transit networks will also affect the ability of staff to travel to work, resulting \nin personnel shortages and, ultimately, impacts to municipal service delivery. Business continuity \n\nplanning for extreme weather events can address these issues, by planning for alternative work \n\narrangements, periodic training,  trial-testing of emergency management procedures, and \n\nmaintaining an emergency contact information database for staff (held by a supervisor and \n\naccessible at all times).', ' 303CHAPTER 9: URBAN 303Table 3: Example of internal and external collaboration in adaptive planning for climate change and \nurban transportation at the City of Toronto.\nPartnershipCoordinated action\nToronto and Region \nConservation Authority \n(TRCA)Flood Warning System:  \n \n\nCommunications Unit (RESCU) for the Don Valley Parkway expressway \n\nand Bayview Extension. This real time monitoring, using cameras and \ncommunication protocol, helps TSD implement road closures and manage \n\n \n\nand real time response to events, and to establish a more comprehensive \n\n\nEnvironmental assessment: \n TRCA is undertaking an in-house environmental assessment and collaborating \n\nwith TSD to identify risks and possible mitigation actions to enhance current \n\n\nAvenue (Don Valley Corridor).\nConsultation with City of Toronto Energy \n\nand Environment \n\n\nCommission and Engineering and \nConstruction Services; \nand other agencies, \nboards, commissions, \nand divisions Climate Change Risk Assessment (CCRA)  (See Case study 1):   \neffect of climate change on the delivery of services, management of \ninfrastructure and protection of the natural environment.\n  The CCRA enables service and infrastructure providers to identify and \n\n\nrisk mitigation or adaptive actions. \nToronto Transit \n\nCommission (TTC)Examples of some collaborative initiatives include:a) TSD developed a harmonized process for implementing concrete bus bays \nand stops; asphalt pavement surfaces at bus stops generally exhibit severe \ndistortion (e.g., rutting) due to bus loads and extreme heat conditions;  \nb) Installation of concrete bus pads on the roadway as part of resurfacing \n\nprojects. These are typically applied only in situations where the existing \n\nasphalt surface is shoving or rutting moderately (>25mm) or more;\nc) \n\nuninterruptable power supply (UPS) devices, including signals at railroads, \n\nmajor intersections and expressway ramp terminals. A pilot program was \n\nd) A second-phase review is underway to identify UPS needs for critical \nintersections located on emergency routes; and \ne) TSD established contracted services for mobile diesel and gas trucks; third \n\nparty fuel cards are available when supply of fuel is affected during extreme \n\nweather events. \n', ' 304CHAPTER 9: URBAN 304Outside of municipal departments, there is also a need to fully engage urban civil society and provide \ninformation about the importance of adaptation to the public (Larrivée, 2010). Practitioners suggest \n\nthat public engagement on adaptation tends to yield conversations about climate mitigation (the \n\nreduction of carbon emissions). The task of municipal agencies is to emphasize the importance of \n\nboth policies in tandem to maximize social value from infrastructure investments. Public engagement \n\nis also necessary to prepare society to function Œ access jobs, health care and other activities Œ when \n\ntransportation systems or infrastructure systems are performing at lower levels.  \n8.0 GAPS AND BARRIERSPractitioners suggest that without buy-in from the executive to operational levels on the severity of \n\nclimate change risks, adaptation planning efforts often fail to be fully implemented. In some instances, \n\n\n\n\n\ndecisions, by helping practitioners prioritize infrastructure-upgrade investments and demonstrate the \n\nvalue of actions taken to reduce future vulnerability (Feltmate and Thistlethwaite, 2012). As more cities \n\nachieve and communicate long-term cost savings and economic competitiveness from adaptation \n\nmeasures, barriers to the widespread introduction of these measures are reduced.\nCoordinating actions among multiple levels of government, agencies, and sectors is another \n\n\ncoordinate emergency-response with other orders of government, in addition to dealing with the \n\n\n9.0 CONCLUSIONThis chapter has demonstrated many ways in which urban transportation networks are vulnerable \n\n\n\nto manage these risks. While municipalities have historically taken adaptive action in the wake of \n\n\n\ntheir partners are working to proactively adapt both infrastructure and operations in advance of \n\nclimate impacts. Case studies in the chapter provide examples of Canadian urban regions engaging \n\nin vulnerability assessments, structural and physical improvements, and organizational change to \n\n\n\nadditional adaptation approaches that may be applied by transportation professionals in Canada, \n\nas appropriate. It is clear that solutions will involve an appropriate mix of proactive and reactive \n\nadaptations.  \nThis chapter has also highlighted the importance of redundancy (of both routes and modes) to \nenhance resiliency, as well as the importance of ﬁlow-regretﬂ adaptation strategies in building \n\nsupport for adaptation efforts within governments and communities. The high up-front costs of \n\nmany adaptation strategies (particularly structural solutions) may be a deterrent, and the complex \n\n\n\nincreasingly important for transportation practitioners to work in collaboration with other municipal \n\nsectors towards common adaptation goals. With strong cooperative efforts, Canada™s multimodal \n\nurban transportation networks can more successfully meet the challenges of a changing climate.\n', ' 305CHAPTER 9: URBAN 305REFERENCESAMEC Inc.
