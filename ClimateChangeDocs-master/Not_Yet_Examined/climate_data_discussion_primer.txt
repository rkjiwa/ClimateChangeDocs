This Primer outlines concepts, principles and language terms used across disciplines that have led to communication issues on climate change vulnerability-risk assessment projects.  This Primer is not intended to be a glossary of technical expressions and terms but indicates where misunderstanding in communication can occur and where definitional clarity may be required.  We anticipate that the list will grow over time as practitioners continue to work together on assessing climate change vulnerability risks.    Practitioner teams are encouraged to openly discuss the use of concepts, principles and language by the various professionals on the team as early in the project as possible.  Furthermore, as interdisciplinary teams expand to include additional professional groups such as architects, accountants, lawyers, asset managers and others, we recommend expanding this document to include concepts, principles and language used by these professionals in their execution of vulnerability-risk assessments.  Over the course of an assessment it is common for communication issues to arise amongst team members.  In our experience, much of this can be resolved by examining how the team members involved may be applying concepts, principles and language in differing ways.  This Primer is intended as a resource in discussions, and to be consulted as to individual topics, when situations arises that require understanding where communication may require clarity.  Teams must be comfortable to challenge each other to define the meaning of their concepts, principles and language as applied within the context of the assessment.  Many generalizations are used to simplify and accentuate communication contrasts that may be encountered with multi-disciplinary teams involved in climate vulnerability risk work.    ! !',

engaged in a number of projects to determine vulnerability-risk to transportation infrastructure in BC from future changes in climate.  The intent of these projects is to understand potential risks to the \ntransportation system and develop adaptation measures to address potential issues.  During these projects, misunderstanding sometimes arose when communicating information because of cross \ndiscipline use of concepts, principles and language.  These sometimes have differing interpretations depending on the practitioner, profession and discipline involved. This project benefited from partnering with Natural Resources Canada under their Adaptation Platform intended to advance adaptation to climate change in Canada.  One element of this initiative was to develop a guideline to help communicate effectively when working on climate change engineering vulnerability-risk assessments.  Experience has shown that individuals may understand concepts, principals and language differently across disciplines.  While individuals may be comfortable with the use of concepts, principals and language within their own discipline, issues can arise without an understanding of how these concepts, principles and language may be used by others.  Understanding these differences can improve discussions, \nteamwork and results.    Previous experience has shown that misunderstandings in concepts and language can lead to delays, scope creep and other issues.  While it can be a challenge for risk assessment participants to develop communications early in a project, it is critical that those involved develop an understanding of each otherÕs concepts, principles and language, as this is a key ingredient for a successful project.  Once parties understand the vernacular of other participants, progress is easier to achieve.  To facilitate this, we have developed this document to help focus discussions and come to a common understanding of concepts, principles and language used by various \ngroups engaged in a climate change vulnerability-risk assessment.  \nIt is clear that many players are required to execute a climate change vulnerability-risk assessment.  For example, the engineering professional brings experience in designing, \nmanaging, operating and maintaining infrastructure systems under various climate conditions especially extreme weather conditions.  They know how a particular facility will respond to extreme weather events and they have a fundamental knowledge of what kind of climate and weather information they need to evaluate infrastructure responses to these events.  \nAnother group, the climate scientists, have expertise in working with climatic data and the various models and statistical approaches that are necessary to ensure that robust climate projection information is applied within an assessment.  They are key players in ensuring that climate data integrity is maintained throughout the project leading to robust and scientifically defensible assessment outcomes.  Clearly groups must learn to communicate their needs and approaches to each other in a timely and efficient manner.  We have no expectation that disciplines change their internal use of concepts and language.  However, we suggest that practitioners must be sensitive to the nuances ', 'E6=68-1\'(9!F..65*\'=6!E\'08-946!G6*H66(!:+05*\'*\'-(6+)!-.!%8\';0*6!%I0(96\n!J48(6+0G\'8\'*,\n"<\')K!L))6));6(*)\n!! <6=!\n>!M!?4(!@\nA!BCD\n@!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:096!\nO!-.!\nNN of how others may use similar concepts, principles and language and how these nuances may lead to differing interpretations and meanings.  \nThis Primer attempts to address these issues and offer concepts, principles and language and approaches to clarify and streamline communication for vulnerability-risk assessment teams. ? @#&2#(/#4.*A!3\'/$\'*1&\n! Each discipline operates under its own unique set of professional expectations.  These may or may not be codified in standards and guidelines, but they are nonetheless very real and place upon the professions cultural demands that translate into accepted behaviours, jargon and standards.  To individuals within these areas of practice, these cultural values are transparent and \nthey may consider them to be the very definition of professionalism, not only within their own profession, but generally.  In the following sections we outline the underlying cultural values that can operate within different groups involved in a climate change vulnerability-risk assessment process.  With a clearer understanding of the cultural milieu within which individuals within disciplines operate, it will be easier for practitioners on climate change vulnerability-risk assessments to better cope with the diverse sets of pressures and expectations that may apply.  ?=;\n C46#411*#46\n! Engineers, for the most part, are applied scientists.  Applied scientists use the results from basic research to develop practical solutions for identified problems.  Engineers work in a world where \nalmost everything must be translated into pragmatic application of:  ! Science;  ! Management; and ! Social, environmental and economic analysis.    \nThey are very practiced at balancing competing pressures but uppermost in their mind is assurance of the public welfare.    Engineers Canada defines the practice of engineering as follows:  The Òpractice of professional engineeringÓ means any act of planning, designing, composing, evaluating, advising, reporting, directing or supervising, or managing any of the foregoing, that requires the application of engineering principles, and that concerns the safeguarding of life, health, property, economic interests, the public welfare or the \nenvironment.1                                                 1 Canadian Engineering Qualifications Board, \nGuideline on the Practice of Professional Engineering in Canada\n, Engineers Canada, 2012\n ', 'E6=68-1\'(9!F..65*\'=6!E\'08-946!G6*H66(!:+05*\'*\'-(6+)!-.!%8\';0*6!%I0(96\n!J48(6+0G\'8\'*,\n"<\')K!L))6));6(*)\n!! <6=!\n>!M!?4(!@\nA!BCD\n@!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:096!\n>!-.!\nNN  These factors have a significant bearing on the way engineers practice their profession and the language that they use to communicate with each other.    As members of a regulated profession, engineers must adhere to a written code of ethics.  Engineers Canada provides guidance on the content of this code and the provinces and territories adopt the code, sometimes with modifications to accommodate regional considerations.  The Engineers Canada Guideline on professional practice provides the code presented in Table 2.1.  9.:/1!\n?=;]!!9%1!C46#411*^&!3)51!)+!C$%#2&\n?  1. Hold paramount the safety, health and welfare of the public and the protection of the environment and promote health and safety within the workplace;  2.

Act as faithful agents of their clients or employers, maintain confidentiality and \navoid conflicts of interest;   4. Keep themselves informed in order to maintain their competence, strive to advance the body of knowledge within which they practice and provide opportunities for the professional development of their subordinates;   5. Conduct themselves with equity, fairness, courtesy and good faith towards \nclients, colleagues and others, give credit where it is due, and accept, as well as give, honest and fair professional criticism;   6. Present clearly to employers and clients the possible consequences if engineering decisions or judgments are overruled or disregarded;   7. Report to their association or other appropriate agencies any illegal or unethical engineering decisions or practices by engineers or others;  8. Be aware of and ensure that clients and employers are made aware of societal and environmental consequences of actions or projects and endeavor to interpret engineering issues to the public in an objective and truthful manner; and  9. Treat equitably and promote the equitable treatment of all clients, colleagues \nand coworkers, regardless of race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, age, physical or mental ability, marital or family status, and national origin.                                                  2 Canadian Engineering Qualifications Board, \nGuideline on the Code of Ethics\n, Engineers Canada, 2012\n ', 'E6=68-1\'(9!F..65*\'=6!E\'08-946!G6*H66(!:+05*\'*\'-(6+)!-.!%8\';0*6!%I0(96\n!J48(6+0G\'8\'*,\n"<\')K!L))6));6(*)\n!! <6=!\n>!M!?4(!@\nA!BCD\n@!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:096!\nP!-.!\nNN  EngineersÕ formative training included many sessions on the code of ethics.  They are required to complete written examinations on these matters as part of their registration into the profession.  As a consequence, the average engineer fundamentally believes that every professional, regardless of their discipline, must adhere to the same standards of practice.  Engineers are very comfortable with the concept of peer review.  However, as applied scientists, they are not as interested in the purity of the science, that is, getting the precisely correct answer.  Within engineering practice, peer review is generally applied in the sense of improving the \nquality of a design or report, assurance of compliance with codes and standards, or providing certification.  This is much more a process of assessing the professional practices applied to a project and much less one of proving a scientific principle.  It is common for engineers to go over each otherÕs work and sign-off on the professional integrity of the process.  When they do so, they are staking their license on their opinion and are therefore very careful about what they offer as professional judgement.  In essence, engineers are looking for a scientific foundation that is good enough to support their activities and assure public wellbeing.  As long as they understand the strengths and weaknesses of a particular scientific fact, or have assurance from others who are qualified to offer these judgements, engineers are very comfortable with proceeding on an initiative while adding appropriate safety margins and \ncontingencies.  These processes are ingrained in the professional culture.  In day-to-day practice some engineers may not immediately identify that other professionals may be operating within \ncompletely different professional/cultural environments.  Ultimately, engineers are driven by a number of principles that can be simply stated.  Engineering initiatives should be:  ! Safe; ! Environmentally sound; ! Functional; ! Reliable; ! On time; and  ! On budget.  \n  While \nthe engineerÕs practice is founded on science, the fundamental characteristic of the profession is application and, provided that appropriate safeguards are employed, they will \naccept less than perfect information to advance a project to completion.    ', 'E6=68-1\'(9!F..65*\'=6!E\'08-946!G6*H66(!:+05*\'*\'-(6+)!-.!%8\';0*6!%I0(96\n!J48(6+0G\'8\'*,\n"<\')K!L))6));6(*)\n!! <6=!\n>!M!?4(!@\nA!BCD\n@!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:096!\nQ!-.!\nNN ?=?\n 3/#\n,.$1!D2#1421\n! Climate scientists, for the most part, are pure or basic scientists.  They pursue development and establishment of information to aid understanding.  In essence, their primary mission is the \npursuit of truth.  Climate scientists work in a world where everything must withstand the scrutiny of their colleagues, not only within their own institutions, but also throughout the entire community of climate experts. They are very practiced at balancing competitive or alternative \ninterpretations of their data and comfortable with processes that scrutinize every nuance of their work.  In the end, they are pursuing the right answer to the questions they are evaluating.  Timelines and budgets, although a normal part of their institutional culture, will often take a back seat to the pursuit of truth and correctness. \n As a result, peer review for a climate scientist is a very different process than it would be for an engineer.  For a climate scientist, peer review is the process of subjecting an author\'s scho\nlarly \nwork, research, or ideas to the scrutiny of others who are experts in the same field, before a paper describing this work is published in a journal.  The review evaluates the basic, fundamental, correctness of a piece of work based on differing perspectives throughout the community of experts.  The process does not evaluate, to the same extent, the overall veracity of the scientific method applied or the economic and social implications of the findings.  It is sufficient to prove that the findings are generally correct.  \n Generally, climate scientists do not work within a regulated profession.  For example, there are strict codes of conduct for a scientist regarding plagiarism, but they are not generally codified in an overarching standard that applies uniformly across the entire discipline.  More commonly, codes of conduct are stated as policies of the institutions for which they work.    \nClimate scientists develop information to aid understanding, prediction and perhaps explanation of phenomena in the natural world as opposed to engineers who develop interventions to alter events.  In essence, scientists deal with concepts while engineers deal with the material word. Ultimately, climate scientists are driven by a number of principles that can be simply stated.  \nClimate information should be:  ! Correct; ! Defensible; ! Reproducible; ! Scientifically based; ! Robust in peer review; and  ! Conceptually sound.   The climate scientistÕs practice is based on scientific method.  They work in a world where \nnew discoveries or theories can fundamentally change the interpretation of their results \nand, for the most part, they are comfortable with this possibility, provided that they have \nfollowed a process that\n is founded on pure science and peer review.\n  ', 'E6=68-1\'(9!F..65*\'=6!E\'08-946!G6*H66(!:+05*\'*\'-(6+)!-.!%8\';0*6!%I0(96\n!J48(6+0G\'8\'*,\n"<\')K!L))6));6(*)\n!! <6=!\n>!M!?4(!@\nA!BCD\n@!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:096!\nR!-.!\nNN ?=F\n D)\'*21&!)+!3)4+/#2$!.45!G#&\'451*&$.45#46\n! The cultures within disciplines can sometimes lead to conflict and misunderstanding among vulnerability assessment team members.   Engineers will bring to bear on any project a sense of urgency based on schedules and budgets.  They are willing to make concessions on the overall correctness of climate information provided that they receive information that is sufficient for the purposes of the assessment at hand.  That is, they do not see climate information as a universal \nset of results that all meet the highest standards of precision and accuracy.  They may sacrifice a certain amount of precision in aid of getting to reasonably accurate information that is of sufficient quality for the present project.   Experience has shown that some climate scientists may not appreciate the engineerÕs approach towards data and vice versa.  Given time and resources climate scientists can provide much higher quality information that may be much more scientifically defensible.  It can be a mystery to them that engineers on the team, operating under different drivers and circumstances, may not view this with the same level of enthusiasm. Engineers, for their part, may struggle with the climate scientistÕs approach to schedules and budgets.  They want the climate information within a very strict project schedule and it can be a mystery to them that the climate scientist is seemingly unwilling or unable to provide it in that fashion.   \nThe result can be a bit of a push and pull regarding development and delivery of information and can create issues between team members. \nThese tensions can be avoided by encouraging teams to initially discuss concepts, language, principles, practices and timelines as applied to their project.  The teams will operate better if there is an understanding of overall expectations and project requirements.    For the benefit of the project, it is helpful if early on, the team discusses these issues and establishes project guidelines that are explicitly understood by everyone on the team.\n   ?=>\n I)\'45.*A!3)45#$#)4&\n! This document identifies the communication boundary conditions often encountered within \ngroups of professionals.  Obviously, generalizing the use of language and behaviors attributed to a group as a whole may not be accurate when attributed to individuals, who are all unique in their use of language, behaviors and attitudes. There are engineers who will exhibit attributes more like the characteristics we attribute to pure scientists.  This may often be the case for engineering scientists, researchers or academics that work in professional environments within research institutions.  Conversely, some climate ', 'E6=68-1\'(9!F..65*\'=6!E\'08-946!G6*H66(!:+05*\'*\'-(6+)!-.!%8\';0*6!%I0(96\n!J48(6+0G\'8\'*,\n"<\')K!L))6));6(*)\n!! <6=!\n>!M!?4(!@\nA!BCD\n@!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:096!\nDC!-.!\nNN scientists may be much more applied in their approaches to their discipline.  This may be observed with meteorological specialists, who must generate daily weather forecasts within limited timeframes and within very tight budget constraints.   In this regard, the behaviors described within this document represent the boundaries of a continuum.  This continuum is illustrated in Figure 2.1.  The professionals that come together to form a vulnerability assessment team, may come from anywhere across the continuum outlined in Figure 2.1.  Often, the use of language, concepts and approaches will overlap between members of the team, but this does not mean that every member of the team is fully conversant with these approaches.  For example, individuals on the more applied end of the continuum may \nhave very little difficulty communicating key technical issues with each other, but they may encounter significant difficulties fully communicating nuances of their technical activities with individuals on the more theoretical end of the continuum.

We do this because many engineers tend to work on the more applied end of the continuum, while many scientists tend to work on the more \ntheoretical end of the continuum.   These generalizations may or may not apply to the behaviour of individual practitioners within each group.  Furthermore, we have observed that individuals may unintentionally shift from formally correct technical language to looser more common language dependent on the tasks they are performing.   The language described in the following sections may appear somewhat loose or informal to some readers.  This looseness of language is driven by the phenomenon we are describing.  We must describe how the language is used during informal conversation or differently between disciplines and this drives us to outline definitions that are not, in the strictest sense, correct.  \nCommon, informal, language often lacks the precision of strict, technical definitions.

For each term we provide a thumbnail sketch of how the terminology may commonly be used and the potential sources of confusion and conflict.  We stress that these thumbnails are generalizations and that them may not reflect the actual technical definitions applied within professional groups.  Not every practitioner may use the terms the way described and, when speaking formally, the actual definitions applied within a profession may be quite consistent.

In practice, an engineer may choose to use data on the extreme ends of a data set to cover worst-case scenarios while the scientist may choose data from the mid range to ensure that the value they provide is defensible within the overall range of data.   One major source of confusion is the scientistÕs tendency to exclude information where they have high levels of uncertainty or lack a precise basis for an estimate.  For example, if the general consensus is that there will be sea level rise, engineers will almost always include a \nsafety factor to accommodate that consensus within their design work.  If they lack a clear basis for this factor, they will assign a value to account for the uncertainty based on professional \njudgment.  On the other hand, the scientist having judged that there is insufficient evidence for an adjustment may simply be silent on the matter, as based on their expert judgment; the lack of sufficient evidence may preclude the use of such data in an analysis of Òbest estimateÓ.

On the other hand, the scientist may be quite uncomfortable with this process and may express concern that the process is being compromised with subjective, and untested, inputs.  \nThe scientist may press for more work to confirm and measure the inputs while the engineer may be perfectly comfortable pursuing the project to completion without further data analysis.  This can lead to conflict on assessment teams.  It is important that both parties understand that professional judgment is not subjective and must only be applied within the bounds of the experience and training of the professionals who are offering their opinions.   One other outcome of this confusion is the tendency of the scientist to ask the engineer to provide a published reference for the basis of the judgment.  While this is sometimes a possibility, in many more cases the judgment is based on a combination of schooling, on-the-job training and hands-on experience that is filtered through years of professional practice.  This is \nnot often simply reported in the literature.  \nWhile it may be foreign to some scientists, it is the basis for higher levels of compensation being afforded to senior members of the profession.  Companies and clients are willing to pay a premium to professionals with a solid history of successfully applying professional judgment.  Professional engineers can face disciplinary action for mistakes in professional judgment.  As a \nresult, the professional engineer will tend to be very careful in applying this judgment to situations where they do not have robust professional experience and training.

The scientist may wish to broaden the discussion to include many other factors that may be well outside of the engineerÕs direct control.  Both approaches are equally valid.  The issue in this case is that the engineer and scientist must agree on the overall scope of the assessment prior to entering into the debate.    Figure 3.3 provides a description of how the engineer would view resiliency and vulnerability.  In the engineerÕs definition, a system will be considered to be resilient when there is sufficient capacity in the system to absorb the affects of anticipated weather events.  Conversely, the system would be deemed to be vulnerable if the system did not have sufficient built-in capacity to absorb anticipated impacts.

It is not uncommon to quote risk as a numerical, or economic value, or as unitless numerical values such as High, Medium or Low. !Unless a scientist has worked with risk management processes, they may have a more generic definition of risk.
