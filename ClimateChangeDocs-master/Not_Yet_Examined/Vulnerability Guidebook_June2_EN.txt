Canada:  \n vi  Contents\n A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making\n', 'Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Management in Canada:\n A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making\n Foreword  \nviiCanada has 397 million hectares of forests and other woodlands, representing 10% of \nthe world™s forest cover. Our forests constitute a world-class natural treasure providing \n\necological, economic, social, and cultural bene˛ts to all Canadians, regardless of whether \n\nthey live in small northern communities or large urban centres. Canada is committed \n\nto sustainable forest management, which aims to maintain and enhance the long-term \n\nhealth of forested ecosystems while providing ecological, economic, cultural, and social \n\nopportunities for present and future generations.\nOne of several factors that pose both opportunities and challenges in terms of e˚ectively \nand e˝ciently meeting our sustainable forest management goals is climate change and \n\nits inherent uncertainties. The Canadian Council of Forest Ministers (CCFM) identi˛ed \n\nclimate change as one of two priority issues for Canada™s forest sector. In its \nA Vision for \nCanada™s Forests: 2008 and Beyond\n, the CCFM stated, ﬁConsideration of climate change \n\nand future climatic variability is needed in all aspects of sustainable forest management.ﬂ \n\nIn addition, to minimize the risks and maximize the bene˛ts associated with a changing \n\nclimate, Canada™s provincial and territorial premiers asked their Ministers responsible for \n\nforest management to collaborate with the federal government on adaptation in forestry \n\nthrough the CCFM™s Climate Change Task Force. Phase 1 of this work, completed in 2010, \n\ninvolved a comprehensive assessment of the vulnerability of various tree species and \n\nidenti˛ed management options for adaptation. Phase 2 has gone beyond the level of \n\ntrees to look at climate change adaptation within forest ecosystems and the broader forest \n\nsector. The goal of phase 2 was to equip members of the forest sector with a suite of tools \n\nand state-of-the-art information to enable them to make better decisions about the need \n\nfor adaptation and the types of measures that may be most bene˛cial.\nOver a period of 2 years, nearly 100 individuals from a wide range of organizations have \ncontributed to achieving this goal. The fruits of their labour have been captured in the \n\nCCFM™s Climate Change Adaptation series, which comprises several technical reports and \n\nreview papers. This current workbook draws upon information from all the previously \n\npublished papers and reports in this series. It is a highly practical and user-oriented \n\nworkbook that will enable forestry professionals to conduct evaluations of climate change \n\nvulnerability and potential adaptation options in a comprehensive and structured manner \n\nas a means of making informed investment and management decisions. \nIt is our sincere hope that these documents, which will be used in conjunction with \nworkshops, seminars, and presentations, will bene˛t Canadian forest practitioners \n\nfrom coast to coast to coast as they seek innovative ways to adapt sustainable forest \n\nmanagement policies and practices for a changing climate.\nDave Peterson\n Kelvin Hirsch\n Co-Chair\n Co-Chair\n CCFM Climate Change Task Force\n CCFM Climate Change Task Force\n British Columbia Ministry of Forests, Lands,\n Natural Resources Canada\n and Natural Resource Operations\n Canadian Forest Service\n Victoria, British Columbia\n Edmonton, Alberta\nFOREWORD\n', '', '0.1  \nAdapting to Climate Change: \n The Need and the Challenge\nDepending on the region, climate change may result in productivity changes, \nmaladaptation of trees, changes in forest land cover or species composition, increases \n\nin the frequency and intensity of biotic and abiotic disturbances, and a host of other \n\nbiophysical e˚ects. In some cases forest productivity will be enhanced by climate change. \n\nHowever, it is expected that the overall net e˚ect of climate change on Canada™s forest will \n\nbe negative, particularly in the absence of early adaptation (Johnston et al. 2009). \nThe potential e˚ects of climate change on forests will likely have important implications \nfor Canada™s ability to achieve sustainable forest management (SFM) objectives and goals \n\nas currently de˛ned. Consequently, climate change was identi˛ed as one of two strategic \n\nissues of national importance for Canadian forest management, and the Canadian Council \n\nof Forest Ministers (CCFM) has recommended that consideration of both climate change \n\nand future climatic variability is needed in all aspects of SFM (CCFM 2008).  \nThe CCFM has identi˛ed six de˛ning criteria that must be met for forests in Canada to \nbe considered as being managed sustainably (see sidebar \nWhat is Sustainable Forest \n\nManagement?\n). SFM is a moving target to which many managers aspire but which they \n\noften ˛nd di˝cult to achieve because of dynamic environmental, economic, cultural, and \n\nsocial conditions. As a consequence, SFM demands continuous monitoring, improvement, \n\nand adjustment. With the additional stresses and pressures caused by changing climate \n\nconditions, it is now widely acknowledged that forest managers may face unprecedented \n\nchallenges in reaching this common goal of sustainability.\nCurrently, SFM policies and practices are often based on an assumption that future \nenvironmental processes and conditions shaping forests will be within the range of \n\nvariability that shaped the current forest. Under a changing climate, however, this \n\nassumption may no longer be valid. Recognition that future climate (and hence growing \n\nconditions, the rate and severity of natural disturbances, conditions for forest harvest \n\noperations, etc.) will be di˚erent from the climate of the recent past and that of the \n\npresent calls for a fundamental rethinking about approaches and assumptions used \n\nin forest management. Failure to acknowledge the new reality of climate change may \n\nresult in widespread impacts, many of which could be reduced or avoided if appropriate \n\nadaptation actions were identi˛ed, planned, and implemented today. Information about \n\nthe vulnerability of forest management systems is needed to determine how best to \n\nincorporate climate change considerations into de˛nitions of SFM and into the norms, \n\nstandards, practices, and policies that are used to implement and monitor SFM.\nAdaptation o˚ers a path forward for forestry practitioners to meet the demands of \nthe forest sector within the context of complex socioecological systems and a rapidly \n\nchanging climate. Adaptation seeks to ensure that the breadth of ecosystem services \n\nprovided by forests and underpinning the competitiveness of Canada™s forest sector is \n\nmaintained under future climates. In other words, the purpose of adaptation is to identify \nINTRODUCTION\nClimate Change and Sustainable Forest Management in Canada:\n A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making\n Introduction\n', 'What is Sustainable Forest Management? \nand implement the measures necessary to reduce vulnerability to climate change and \nthus to increase the likelihood that SFM objectives will be achieved. Therefore, the \n\nfundamental goals of adaptation and SFM are the same.  \nAdaptation is often implemented at a local or regional scale, and it can be enabled by \ninstitutions and policies that support adaptation actions. The need for adaptation within \n\nforest management varies across ecosystems and is related to the vulnerability of SFM \n\nsystems relative to their ability to achieve SFM objectives under a changing climate. Tools \n\nand knowledge that allow forest resource professionals operating at various scales to \n\nunderstand climate change and to e˚ectively and e˝ciently adapt to potential impacts \n\nare required. The CCFM has addressed this need, in part, through its ﬁAdapting Sustainable \n\nForest Management to Climate Changeﬂ report series (see Edwards and Hirsch 2012), \n\nwhich outlines a comprehensive approach to understanding and adapting SFM to climate \n\nchange. The current guidebook is part of the series and provides a ﬁhow toﬂ tool for \n\napplying the CCFM adaptation framework described by Williamson et al. (2012). \nForests provide signi˜cant ecological, economic, \n\nsocial, and cultural bene˜ts to Canadians. As \n\ndevelopment pressures on forest resources have \n\nmounted over time, the need for a concept of forest \n\nmanagement that ensures conservation of healthy \n\nforests for future generations, while allowing \n\nfor a balanced, equitable, and e˚cient ˛ow of \n\necological, economic, social, and cultural bene˜ts \n\nfor current generations, has become apparent. The \n\nconcept of sustainable forest management (SFM) \n\nwas developed in response to this need. SFM has \n\nnow been embraced by forest managers across \n\nCanada. Furthermore, demonstrating adherence to \n\nthe principles of SFM has become an international \n\nrequirement, both through international \n\nagreements, such as the Montréal Process \n \n(see www.montrealprocess.org\n), and through \n\nvarious forest management processes, such as \n\ncerti˜cation. \nTo implement SFM and to ascertain whether it was \nbeing achieved, a clear de˜nition of the concept \n\nand a mechanism or tool to monitor and measure \n\nprogress toward it were required. The Canadian \n\nCouncil of Forest Ministers (CCFM) therefore \n\ndeveloped a national framework of criteria and \nindicators to meet these dual requirements (CCFM \n\n2006). This framework sets out six criteria for \n\nachieving SFM: \nCriterion 1.\n Biological diversity \nCriterion 2.\n  \nEcosystem condition and \nproductivity\nCriterion 3.\n Soil and water\nCriterion 4.\n Role in global ecological cycles \nCriterion 5.\n Economic and social bene˜ts\nCriterion 6.\n Society™s responsibility \nManaging forests according to these six criteria is \n\nfar from the largely timber-focused management \n\napproach of the past. Instead, SFM works to address \n\nand balance a wide range of ecological, economic, \n\nsocial, and cultural considerations so that the \n\nneeds and expectations of all forest users may be \n\nmet today and in the future. This comprehensive \n\napproach requires more than just dealing with \n\nthe immediate challenges of the day; it also \n\nrequires working to predict long-term trends so \n\nthat Canadians can plan how best to maintain the \n\nhealth and well-being of the country™s forests and \n\nforest economy. \nClimate Change and Sustainable Forest Managment in Canada:  \n 2  Introduction\n A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making\n', 'Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Management in Canada:\n A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making\n Introduction  \n30.2  \nOverview of the CCFM Framework for \n Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming \n \nClimate Change into SFM\nThe CCFM has developed an SFM adaptation approach that can be used by forest \nresource professionals across Canada to identify how best to incorporate climate change \n\nconsiderations into their SFM policies, plans, and practices. At the center of the CCFM \n\nSFM adaptation approach, and the foundation for this guidebook, is a framework for \n\nidentifying sources of vulnerability to climate change that are important to sustainability \n\nand developing adaptation options to reduce these vulnerabilities. \nThe framework, which provides a structured decision-making approach to adapting \nSFM to climate change, is explained in detail in the CCFM report ﬁAdapting Sustainable \n\nForest Management to Climate Change: A Framework for Assessing Vulnerability \n\nand Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Makingﬂ (Williamson et al. 2012). The \n\nframework outlines the following four stages for adaptation, which in turn encompass six \n\ncomponents (or steps) (see Figure 0.1): \n  \nStage 1 Œ Organizational readiness:\n The aim of stage 1 is to explore the organization™s \nreadiness to undertake an SFM vulnerability and adaptation assessment (see Gray 2012). \n\nThis guidebook assumes that this stage has been completed and that the organization \n\nis prepared to initiate an SFM vulnerability assessment and potentially to change SFM \n\npolicies and practices if required.\n  \nStage 2 Œ Pre-vulnerability analysis:\n The aim of stage 2 is to develop the context \n\nof the assessment, describe the current climate and climateŒforest relationships, and \n\ndevelop future climate and forest impact scenarios.\n  \nStage 3 Œ Detailed vulnerability analysis:\n The aim of stage 3 is to identify where SFM \n\nis vulnerable to climate change (and therefore where adaptation is needed) and where \n\nopportunities or positive e˚ects could occur (which could be enhanced by adaptation). \n  \nStage 4 Œ Identify, implement, and monitor adaptation:\n The aim of stage 4 is to \n\nevaluate, implement, monitor, and mainstream adaptation measures into SFM decision \n\nmaking. \nThe adaptation framework is somewhat general in nature and nonprescriptive in terms of \n\nconcrete steps required for adaptation of SFM. This guidebook provides an approach to \n\nmoving the framework from general theory into practice.  \n', 'Explore organizational\nreadiness\nPhase 1Organizational\nreadiness\nPhase 2Pre-vulnerability\n\nanalysis\nPhase 3Detailed vulnerability\n\nanalysis\nPhase 4Identify, implement\n\nand monitor adaptation\n1Provide Context\n2Current Climate \nand Forest Conditions\n4Assess\nVulnerability\n5Identify and Evaluate\nAdapation\n6Implement and\nMainstream Adaptation\n3Future Climate and \nForest Scenarios\nFigure 0.1.  \n The four stages and six components (indicated by green boxes) of adaptation to climate change in the \ncontext of sustainable forest management (adapted from Williamson et al. 2012).\nClimate Change and Sustainable Forest Managment in Canada:  \n 4  Introduction\n A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making\n', 'Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Management in Canada:\n A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making\n About This Guidebook  \n50.3 About this GuidebookGoal and Objectives\nThe intent of this guidebook is to provide practical guidance to forest resource \nprofessionals (practitioners and policy makers) who are applying the CCFM approach \n\nto vulnerability assessment and adaptation planning for SFM. This guidebook has the \n\nfollowing attributes:\n   \nprimarily targets forestry practitioners (at the operational and planning levels) but also \nrecognizes the importance of supporting policy makers in mainstreaming climate \n\nchange adaptation (see sidebar De˜nitions)   \nfocuses on how to assess the vulnerability of SFM objectives to climate change and \n\nidentify options for mainstreaming adaptation into decision making  \n   \nis relevant to both practice and policy but is not prescriptive\n   \nrecognizes that there is no single best method for implementing the framework \n\nthat will be suitable in all situations, given that capacity, resource availability,  \n\nmanagement, and climate change impacts all di˚er widely from region to region \n\nwithin Canada\n   \nshares key ˛ndings and lessons learned from early attempts at forestry-related \n\nvulnerability assessments in Canada (case studies)\n   \nprovides a structured decision-making process for acquiring climate impact \n\nknowledge to help guide SFM adaptation decisions and actions  \n   \nprovides a framework for maintaining a record of decision making, prompting users \n\nto document the reasoning behind changes to management policies and practices.\nOverview\nEach chapter in the guidebook corresponds to one of the components of the CCFM \n\nframework for assessing vulnerability and mainstreaming adaptation, as described in \n\nWilliamson et al. (2012) and illustrated in Figure 0.1 (referred to as the framework). The \n\nframework is a general approach that can be used by forest resource professionals across \n\nCanada to identify how best to incorporate climate change considerations into SFM \n\npolicies and plans. Each chapter is structured around a series of worksheets (presented in \n\nchapter 7) that are designed to assist users through the methodologies presented herein \n\nand to help them document the results and discussions of each assessment stage. A \n\nglossary is included to ensure common understanding of the terms used throughout this \n\nguidebook (see Appendix 1).Each chapter contains the following elements:\n\n  Purpose and expected outcomes\n  Worksheets:\n   -  \nTheory\n Œ provides background, based on the literature and practitioners™ experience, \nand theory for the guidance being provided \nDe˜nitionsForestry practitioners: \nForestry practitioners \nare those responsible \nfor operational activities \nand for developing forest \nmanagement plans to \nachieve directions set \n at the strategic level.\nPolicy makers: \nPolicy \nmakers are those \nresponsible for high-level \nor strategic-level plans \nto develop policies and \nprograms that both facilitate \nand guide the work of \n forest practitioners.\n', '  -  \nPractice\n Œ provides practical guidance for completing the worksheets, along with \nsuggested alternative methods (a basic approach and a more comprehensive \n\napproach) for tailoring the guidance provided to each project™s unique \n\ncircumstances  \n   Case studies\n to demonstrate how some of the vulnerability assessment concepts \n\nhave been put into practice across Canada\n   Strategic and operational considerations\n for implementing methodologies \n\ndescribed herein, drawn from the literature and practitioner™s experiences \nThe purpose of each chapter and its associated worksheets are described in Table 0.1. \nAlthough a sequential approach is recommended, it is not essential, and an iterative \nprocess may be required as the assessment project unfolds. In addition, not all worksheets \n\nwill be useful for all projects, and it will be up to each assessment team to determine \n\nwhich will be the most helpful for their project and to identify the best available method \n\nfor completing them, given the resources available.  \nThroughout the guidebook several methodological approaches, ranging from basic \nto more comprehensive, are provided to help the user understand how to approach \n\nthe framework steps and worksheets. The approach selected will often depend on the \n\nassessment resources available and the scope and scale of the assessment. \nUsers of the guidebook should seek to understand  and investigate the trade-o˜s inherent in selecting \n \none approach over another. \nFor example, selecting a basic approach may provide an easier and quicker route to the \nnext step in the vulnerability assessment process but may mean that critical aspects of \n\nthe SFM system are not considered. Conversely, a more comprehensive approach may \n\nmean that more information and more aspects of the SFM system are considered, but \n\nmore resources and time may be required to gather the data, information, and knowledge \n\nrequired to complete the assessment stage.  \nThe steps in the CCFM adaptation framework, and the guidance presented within this \nguidebook, are based on principles of structured decision making (identify objectives, \n\nde˛ne problem, identify and assess options against objectives; see sidebar \nStructured \n\nDecision Making\n), principles of adaptive management (plan, act, monitor, evaluate, \n\nadjust), and decision making under uncertainty (e.g., employ scenarios to explore possible \n\nfutures). \nUsers are encouraged to treat every step of this guidebook \nas an ongoing and iterative process, and to understand that \n\neach step can be revisited once new knowledge is gained. \nAlso, although the worksheets provided represent a suggested approach to applying the \nframework, users of this guidebook are encouraged to adapt them as required. However, \n\nusers should try to adhere to the concepts within the framework even if such adjustments \n\nare made.\nClimate Change and Sustainable Forest Managment in Canada:  \n 6  About This Guidebook\n A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making\n', 'Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Management in Canada:\n A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making\n About This Guidebook  \n7Structured Decision Making \nA process to plan for climate change adaptation \nmay bene˜t from the application of concepts \n\ndeveloped for decision analysis. A structured \n\ndecision-making approach represents a useful \n\nway to guide the development, evaluation, \n\nimplementation, monitoring, and mainstreaming \n\nof adaptation recommendations and strategies. \n\nStructured decision making provides a useful \n\nframework to assess when and where a particular \n\nadaptation option may be suitable. In relation to \n\nadaptation to climate change, structured decision \n\nmaking involves establishing management \n\nobjectives for the future forest;  determining \n\nthe vulnerability of forest ecosystems, forest \n\ncommunities, local economies, and human \n\npopulations;  developing alternative adaptation \n\noptions;  evaluating alternative options against \n\nmanagement objectives;  implementing desired \n\nadaptation policies and practices;  monitoring \n\nthe e˝ectiveness of climate change adaptation \n\ne˝orts in achieving management objectives; \n\nand  modifying management practices when \n\nadaptation e˝orts are unsuccessful in meeting \n\nmanagement objectives (e.g., adaptive \n\nmanagement).  Articulating speci˜c objectives \n\nmay increase the success of planning processes in \n\naddressing long-term concerns within short-term \n\ndecisions. This approach is consistent with the \n\napproach adopted in the CCFM report ﬁAdapting \n\nSustainable Forest Management to Climate \nChange: A Framework for Assessing Vulnerability \n\nand Mainstreaming Adaptationﬂ (Williamson et al. \n\n2012).Structured decision making has many similarities \nto the adaptation policy framework process \n\nsuggested by the United Nations Development \n\nProgramme. Both involve assessing current \n\nvulnerability, formulating adaptation strategies, \n\nand then implementing, monitoring, and \n\nimproving the initiatives launched. Structured \n\ndecision making places more emphasis on the \n\narticulation of management objectives and the \n\nevaluation of alternative options and strategies \n\nagainst these objectives. The adaptation policy \n\nframework process places more emphasis \n\non who is involved in making the evaluation \n\n(strong stakeholder engagement), on the careful \n\nscoping of a project to ensure that it is well \n\nintegrated into a policy and planning process \n\n(to foster implementation of results), and on \n\nenhancing adaptive capacity. Neither approach \n\nrequires high-quality data or extensive modeling \n\nexpertise, and both approaches encourage \n\nthoughtful assessment and a structured process.\nThe following sources provide helpful information \non structured decision making: Lim and Spanger \n\nSiegfried (2005); Ogden and Innes (2007); Ohlson \n\net al.

The focus is to develop an understanding of the \n\nneed to address climate change and thus undertake an SFM vulnerability assessment, and \n\nto clearly de˛ne the goals of the assessment.\nThis chapter also helps users of the guidebook to de˛ne the SFM system of interest by \ndescribing the spatial extent and scope of the assessment, identifying the actors and \n\ndecision makers, understanding both the decision-making context (e.g., governance) and \n\nthe policy context, and determining if the required resources are available to conduct the \n\nassessment as de˛ned. Taking appropriate time at the beginning of the assessment to \n\nclearly de˛ne the system of interest is important to success. \nThis chapter is structured around three worksheets that are designed to facilitate an SFM \nvulnerability assessment:\nWorksheet 1.1.\n  De˛ne the problem or challenge\n\nWorksheet 1.2.\n   Describe the SFM system and de˛ne the scope of the vulnerability \nassessmentWorksheet 1.3.\n  Con˛rm the scope of the assessment \nFrom the assessment \nframework–\nﬁA description of the context is \nneeded for three reasons.

The scoping step can be strengthened by explicitly considering \n\nthe question, ﬁWhat might be the consequences of not undertaking a vulnerability \n\nassessment and not adapting proactively to climate change?ﬂ (Williamson et al. 2012). \n\nThis type of localized information can also provide concrete examples of why a climate \n\nchange vulnerability assessment is needed. These examples can be valuable when seeking \n\nresources and commitment for the assessment.\nIf clear factors have prompted a vulnerability assessment of SFM and some bene˛ts of an \nassessment have been de˛ned, it may also be useful to clearly de˛ne why you wish to \n\nproceed with the assessment and what you hope to achieve. Developing well-de˛ned \n\npurpose and outcome statements at this early stage can help focus the scope and \n\nparticipation level of the assessment. \nThe outcome of de˛ning the problem or challenge should be a direct statement that \nspeci˛es the problem to be addressed, the purpose of the vulnerability assessment, and \n\nthe expected outcomes of the assessment. \n1.2.2     The Practice\nAlthough de˛ning the climate change problem or challenge is crucial at the initiation of \n\nan e˚ective climate change vulnerability assessment, this step is often not taken seriously. \n\nAs a result, the focus for the assessment may be unclear, and relevant decision makers \n\nor interested parties may be omitted from the process. Lack of clear problem de˛nition \n\nmay also lead to an ever-expanding assessment, which may in turn result in a fatigue of \n\nresources, in terms of both ˛nancial support and participants™ attention. \n', 'Worksheet 1.1 (De˜ne the problem or challenge)\n guides you in preparing the \nstatements of purpose and expected outcome after identi˛cation of the factors that have \n\ntriggered the assessment and exploration of the anticipated bene˛ts of a vulnerability \n\nassessment or the potential consequences of not doing so.\nA basic approach\nBring together your colleagues to brainstorm and complete \nWorksheet 1.1 (De˜ne the \nproblem or challenge)\n. If possible, include one key decision maker. \nA comprehensive \n\napproach\nInvite representatives from all departments in your organization, as well as from other \n\norganizations and agencies with SFM roles for your area. Work together to explore possible \n\ntriggers and a˚ected decisions and decision-makers, keeping an open mind to the diversity \n\nof views. Try to avoid seeking consensus at this stage and instead simply record the diversity \n\nof views, as this re˜ects the reality that you will likely encounter during the assessment. \nOperational \n\nconsiderations\n  Be mindful of the possible implications of triggers on operational factors such as length of \n\nthe harvest season or the need for unexpected salvage harvesting. Consider which decisions \n\nare actually made by operations personnel, including contractors and forest workers.\nStrategic considerations\n  At the strategic scale, challenges related to climate change can a˚ect several decisions. \n\nFor example, an increase in the area burned by wild˛res can necessitate increased salvage \n\nharvesting, change reforestation success, shift timber supply, and alter wildlife habitats, all of \n\nwhich may a˚ect strategic decisions. \nVulnerability\n1.3 De˜ne the SFM System of Interest  \n1.3.1     The Theory\nThe concept of vulnerability (see sidebar \nVulnerability\n) that has been adopted in the \nassessment framework (Williamson et al. 2012) focuses on a de˛ned climate-sensitive \n\nﬁsystem.ﬂ SFM is carried out through a complex, integrated socioecological system, with \n\nelements that are more or less sensitive to climate. \nDe˛ning the SFM system of interest entails choosing and describing an appropriate \ngeographic (spatial) scale for the vulnerability assessment, listing the actors (i.e., those \n\ninvolved in making decisions and those a˚ected by the decisions), and describing the \n\nlarger decision-making context (e.g., policies and regulations) within which the system \n\nresides. Clearly de˛ning the SFM system of interest early in the vulnerability assessment \n\nand adaptation process can help reduce barriers to adaptation later on (Moser and \n\nEkstrom 2010). \nCanadian SFM systems encompass a de˛ned land area and include two types of elements: \n\n  natural biophysical elements (e.g., ecosystems, forest types, streams, wildlife)\n   \nhuman elements (e.g., individuals and organizations, institutions, built infrastructure \nsuch as roads).\nThe SFM system also includes management objectives, which de˛ne the outcomes \n\ndesired from the system, and indicators used to measure achievement of these objectives. \n\nClimate change is likely only one of several factors in˜uencing the SFM system. Other key \nﬁThe degree to which \n\na system is susceptible \n\nto, and unable to cope \n\nwith, adverse e˝ects of \n\nclimate change, including \n\nclimate variability and \n\nextremes. Vulnerability is a \n\nfunction of the character, \n\nmagnitude, and rate \n\nof climate change and \n\nvariation to which a system \n\nis exposed, its sensitivity, \n\nand its adaptive capacity.ﬂ \nŠ(Parry et al. 2007) \nClimate Change and Sustainable Forest Managment in Canada:  \n 16  Chapter 1\n A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making\n', 'Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Management in Canada:\n A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making\n Chapter 1  \n17factors of change, such as local land-use trends and global economic trends, should also \nbe included in your description of the SFM system.  \nExplicitly describing your SFM system ensures that the vulnerability assessment addresses \nall the climate-sensitive dimensions of the system and takes into account the nonclimatic \n\nfactors that may exacerbate or lessen climate vulnerabilities. The following sections \n\nprovide background information on describing your SFM system.\nDe˜ning the Spatial Scale\nThe factors prompting a vulnerability assessment and adaptation planning project can aid \n\nin de˛ning your assessment area, as they may indicate the spatial scale at which the issue \n\nis best examined. The appropriate spatial scale is often related to the decision context \n\n(or contexts) within which the issue is best addressed. Generally, the greater the scale of \n\nthe issue, the more complex the assessment (with more stakeholders [interested parties], \n\nmore policy linkages, etc.). Many climate change issues operate across multiple scales, a \n\nconsideration that should be taken into account within any vulnerability assessment and \n\nadaptation planning project. For more information, see Theme 1: Spatial and Temporal \n\nContext in Gray (2012).\nLocal area Œ \nA smaller area provides the opportunity to explore vulnerability and \nadaptation to climate change in a very speci˛c biogeographic and political context \n\n(e.g., a community forest or woodlot). Such assessments tend to be more operational in \n\nnature and the local management objectives may be more clearly de˛ned compared \n\nwith regional or national scales (see ﬁCase study Œ Local area: Site prescriptions for fuel \n\nabatement and biodiversity conservation in Jasper National Parkﬂ). \nA lesson learned from \nforestry vulnerability \nassessment case studies \n(Johnston and \n \nEdwards 2013):\nDe˚ning the SFM system of interest, \nthe scale, the scope, and the level of \n\nparticipation are the most critical \n\nsteps in a vulnerability assessment. \nAn assessment that is well matched \nto available resources and has the \n\nappropriate level of engagement \n\nfrom interested parties is likely to be \n\nmore successful in implementing \n\nadaptation options and reducing \n\nbarriers to new approaches and \n\npractices.\nCase Study Œ Local area: \nSite prescriptions for \n\nfuel abatement and \n\nbiodiversity conservation \n\nin Jasper National Park\nFor communities located at the wildlandŒurban interface, climate change may be of \n\nincreasing concern because of anticipated changes in the forest ˛re regime. The FireSmart \n\nmanual (Partners in Protection 2003), developed by the Partners in Protection program \n\nto support fuel abatement around communities, has been adopted and implemented \n\nby many communities across Canada, including Jasper National Park. Consistent with the \n\nprinciples of SFM, Jasper National Park has successfully integrated the management of other \n\nvalues, such as biodiversity and visual esthetics, into its site prescriptions for fuel abatement. \n\nWhile this example does not explicitly deal with climate change, it is an example of the \n\noperational nature of local risk and vulnerability assessments. \nSource: Westhaver (2007). \nRegional area\n Œ Regional assessments (e.g., for a watershed, timber supply area, or forest \ndistrict) represent a level of complexity above that of local studies. Assessments at this \n\nscale tend to demand more integration between di˚erent decision-making contexts, \n\ninvolve a larger number of stakeholders (or interested parties), and require more careful \n\nexamination of trade-o˚s in the exploration of adaptation options. Regional assessments \n\noften address both strategic and operational considerations. Examples of regional area \n\nvulnerability assessments are highlighted in Johnston and Edwards (2013), and one \n\nexample is summarized in ﬁCase study Œ Regional area: Southwest Yukon.ﬂ\n', 'Case Study Œ Regional \narea: Southwest Yukon\nThe southwest Yukon has provided an ideal location for examining climate change \n\nvulnerability and adaptation. Accumulating evidence suggests that the Champagne and \n\nAishihik First Nations (CAFN) Traditional Territory (CATT) in southwest Yukon is already \n\nexperiencing the impacts of climate change. Warmer winters and warmer, drier summers \n\nbeginning in the early 1990s have contributed to a severe spruce beetle outbreak a˚ecting \n\nalmost 400 000 ha of white spruce forest (of an estimated 600 000 ha) in the CATT. This \n\nis the largest and most intense recorded outbreak of spruce beetle in Canada. Climate \n\nchange played a critical role in increasing the population of beetles to epidemic levels, \n\na phenomenon exacerbated by the large tracts of mature white spruce characterizing \n\nthe forests in this region. Also, since the mid-1990s, the spruce beetle outbreak has been \n\ndriving forest management and planning e˚orts in the a˚ected region. In December 2004, \n\na Strategic Forest Management Plan (SFMP) for the CATT was jointly approved by the \n\nCAFN and the Government of Yukon. The plan identi˛es reduction of ˛re hazard, renewal \n\nof beetle-killed forests, provision of economic bene˛ts, and preservation of wildlife habitat \n\nas priorities. In April 2006, the CAFN and the Government of Yukon jointly set a salvage \n\nharvest level for this zone of up to 1 million cubic meters of beetle-a˚ected timber over 10 \n\nyears. Climate change impacts are likely to a˚ect whether the community-directed SFMP \n\ngoals, which include having functioning forest ecosystems and providing community \n\nsustainability and bene˛ts, can be achieved. Although planning has been driven by a \n\nclimatically induced outbreak, climate change adaptation was not an explicit consideration \n\nin the planning process. To explore the possibilities for such adaptation further, 30 \n\nlocal forest practitioners engaged in a participatory process to identify climate change \n\nvulnerabilities and evaluate alternative adaptation options. A structured decision-making \n\napproach was used to frame the assessment. The existence of regional management \n\nobjectives greatly facilitated the evaluation of over 80 adaptation options. Practitioners \n\nidenti˛ed 24 of these adaptation options as being important to implement to achieve the \n\nregional goals and objectives of sustainable forest management in light of climate change.\nSource: Ogden and Innes (2009). \nNational or provincial/territorial area\n Œ Not all issues lend themselves to assessment \nlocally or regionally, and some climate change vulnerabilities and opportunities are \n\nbest addressed at a larger scale. An example of a larger-scale project is the assessment \n\nexamining the risk of the mountain pine beetle spreading beyond British Columbia \n\nto eastern pine forests. The National Forest Pest Strategy facilitated this assessment, \n\nwith input being required from jurisdictions in both western and central Canada (see \n\nﬁCase study Œ National area: National Forest Pest Strategyﬂ). The outcome of a provincial, \n\nterritorial, or national assessment may include the establishment of broad policies \n\nproviding guidance and support for adaptation planning at regional and local scales. \n\nThese studies tend to be more strategic in nature.\nIn many cases, successful adaptation processes combine policy making with proactive \nrisk management. In this way, key adaptation priorities are identi˛ed and addressed at the \n\nappropriate level. \nClimate Change and Sustainable Forest Managment in Canada:  \n 18  Chapter 1\n A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making\n', 'Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Management in Canada:\n A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making\n Chapter 1  \n19Case Study Œ National \narea: National Forest Pest \n\nStrategy\nThe provinces, territories, and federal government agreed to collaborate on developing \n\nthe National Forest Pest Strategy (NFPS), which would enable forest managers across the \n\ncountry to manage forest pests in a more proactive, integrated way through more e˝cient \n\nuse of knowledge and technology. In 2007, forest managers and scientists tested the risk \n\nassessment approach of the NFPS on a real-world question: Would the mountain pine beetle \n\noutbreak, already spreading beyond British Columbia, present a threat to Canada™s boreal and \n\neastern pine forests? Combining biological evidence, climate change trends, and computer \n\nsimulations, the researchers concluded that the beetle does pose a real risk to the boreal \n\nforest. This assessment has led to calls for attempts to slow the beetle™s spread eastward, to \n\ngive resource industries and governments time to address the susceptibility of their forests. \nSources:\n Canadian Council of Forest Minsters Forest Pest Working Group: \n \nhttp://www.ccfm.org/english/coreproducts-forestpests.asp\nNatural Resources Canada National Forest Pest Strategy: \n http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/forests/insects-diseases/13409\nBiophysical Elements of the SFM Area\nThe natural biophysical elements of SFM vulnerability assessments most often focus on \nforested ecosystems. A detailed description of forest ecosystems and their existing natural \n\ndrivers of change (e.g., ˛re dynamics, forest pest dynamics) is a useful starting point for a \n\nvulnerability assessment. Nonforested ecosystems (e.g., wetlands, grasslands) may also be \n\nincluded, as climate change is likely to a˚ect these ecosystems and may in˜uence SFM \n\npractices and adaptation options. \nHuman Elements of the SFM System\nSFM systems include a variety of human elements (e.g. individuals, organizations, \n\ngovernance structures, institutions) that in˜uence how decisions are made and \n\nimplemented. It is essential to account for these human elements in an SFM vulnerability \n\nassessment. For example, it may be useful to consider individuals, agencies, organizations, \n\nor governments with the following characteristics:\n  involved in overall land management or partnered in the management of the area\n  involved in reviewing or approving plans or in regulatory compliance or enforcement\n  holding land-use tenures\n   in a position to a˚ect decisions for the area\n   in a position to be a˚ected by decisions for the area.\nIndividuals within the SFM system will include personnel from these organizations, \nincluding managers and professional and operational sta˚, as well as individuals who are \n\nnot a˝liated with any particular organization but who are interested in the area for other \n\nvalues, such as recreation users and the general public.\n', 'SFM Management Objectives\nDe˛ning management objectives is a key task within the SFM vulnerability assessment \nframework, as it is these objectives that form the basis of the assessment. \nThe central question of an SFM vulnerability assessment is \nwhether SFM objectives can be met with current policies and \n\npractices, given the current climate and a range of potential \nfuture climates. \nMost forest management plans in Canada include clearly stated management objectives \nthat de˛ne the desired future forest conditions or economic and societal outcomes of \n\nmanagement actions, with criteria and measurable indicators to report progress toward \n\nmeeting those objectives (see sidebar \nCanadian Council of Forest Ministers™ Criteria \n\nand Indicators Framework\n). For many forest management plans with third-party \n\ncerti˛cation, these objectives and indicators may already be well de˛ned. \nKey Nonclimatic SFM Factors\nClimate change vulnerability assessments should not be conducted in isolation from other \n\nkey management factors that already have in˜uenced SFM (or may in˜uence SFM over \n\ntime). Today, many Canadian forest-sector operations must contend with competition for \n\nworkers, an aging workforce, severe ˛nancial pressures, and shifts in land use and public \n\nvalues. Climate change is a cross-cutting issue that should be considered along with other \n\nfactors of change. The impacts of climate change may inhibit or enhance the e˚ects of \n\nthese other factors. Likewise, these other factors may a˚ect the ability to successfully \n\nimplement adaptation options.\nCanadian Council of Forest Ministers Criteria and Indicators Framework\nThe Canadian Criteria and Indicators Framework of the Canadian Council of Forest Ministers (CCFM) is a \n\nscience-based framework used to de˜ne and measure Canada™s progress in SFM. The criteria represent \n\nforest values that Canadians want to enhance or sustain, with the indicators identifying scienti˜c factors \n\nthat can be used to assess the state of the forests and measure progress over time (see Appendix 3 for the \n\nlist of current CCFM SFM Criteria and Indictors). \nThe framework was created in 1995 and was most recently updated in 2003 (CCFM 2003). \n A national status report was prepared in 2005 (CCFM 2006). \nFor additional information on the CCFM Criteria and Indicators see \n http://www.ccfm.org/english/coreproducts-criteria_in.asp.\nClimate Change and Sustainable Forest Managment in Canada:  \n 20  Chapter 1\n A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making\n', 'Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Management in Canada:\n A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making\n Chapter 1  \n211.3.2     The Practice\nIn practice, a number of issues may drive adaptation, thus in˜uencing the aspects of \nthe SFM system that should be assessed. Consider the problems or challenges that you \n\nidenti˛ed in Worksheet 1.1 as having prompted this assessment, to aid in de˛ning the \n\nscale, boundaries, and elements of the SFM system to be considered in the assessment. \n\nDescribe the SFM system in enough detail to give all assessment participants a good \n\nunderstanding of the biophysical aspects (i.e., the forest ecosystems) within the de˛ned \n\ngeographic scale, the bene˛ts and values derived from the forests within this area, and \n\nthe decision contexts and the stakeholders or interested parties within the de˛ned \n\nassessment scope. \nWorksheet 1.2 (Describe the SFM system and de˜ne the scope of the vulnerability \nassessment)\n provides guidance on describing the SFM system of interest and de˛ning \n\nthe scope of the SFM vulnerability assessment.\nA basic approach\nA local-level, single-driver assessment tends to be the simplest approach. You may wish to \nconstrain the boundaries of your assessment to something at this scale, particularly if you \n\nhave limited resources and/or a desire to gain some experience in vulnerability assessment \n\nand adaptation planning before taking on a more complex and challenging assessment at a \n\nbroader level.\nA comprehensive \n\napproach\nA more comprehensive approach depends on your unique situation. Scoping the most \n\nappropriate SFM area to address your needs, given available resources, is the ideal approach. \n\nAlso, no matter the scale at which your SFM area is de˛ned, it is essential to pay attention to \n\ncross-scale issues and considerations. \nOperational \n\nconsiderations\n  Keeping your decision-making context in mind may help in determining the SFM system \n\nfor the assessment. Matching your SFM system to the decisions that you wish to inform \n\nmay help to enhance the uptake of the vulnerability assessment and its relevance to the \n\ndecision-making process.\nStrategic considerations\n  Is your vulnerability assessment and adaptation planning process being driven by a single \n\nissue or vulnerability? Or is there a desire to perform a comprehensive assessment that \n\nexamines all potential vulnerabilities? Consider these questions as you decide upon the \n\nSFM system for the assessment. Having a clear notion of your SFM system will help you \n\nto target your assessment and information-gathering process and to more clearly de˛ne \n\nthe interested parties, stakeholder groups, and/or assessment partners. Also, keep in mind \n\nthat climate change may interact with other drivers of change, such as changes in markets \n\nconditions or workforce availability and new technologies.\nYou may want to build a \nteam work plan and a team \n\ncharter to outline each \n\nmember™s commitments \n\nand tasks for the \n\nvulnerability assessment. \n\nYou may also wish to \n\nconsider a communications \nplan that de˛nes the key \n\nparticipants and interested \n\nparties and how you plan \n\nto involve them in the \n\nassessment process and \n\ncommunicate to them the \n\nprogress and results of the \n\nassessment.HINT', '1.4 Con˜rm the Scope of the Assessment \n1.4.1 The Theory\nAt this early stage, vulnerability assessments can be complex and time-consuming. They \ncan also be frustrating and unproductive if the scope does not match the resources \n\navailable, leading to the withdrawal of participants from the climate change adaptation \n\nprocess. One important rule of thumb is to start with the simplest representation of the \n\nproblem, increasing the complexity only as required (Ohlson et al. 2005).\nScaling an assessment to realistically match the resources available is essential at this early \nstage of climate change adaptation. E˚ectively exploring one aspect of the identi˛ed \n\nproblem that leads to proactive adaptation and ongoing learning may be much more \n\ndesirable than not initiating assessment and adaptation at all. Other aspects of the \n\nidenti˛ed problems and challenges can then be assessed over time as part of an adaptive \n\nmanagement approach, keeping in mind that the adaptation process is ideally an \n\nongoing and iterative process (i.e., it is mainstreamed into day-to-day decision making).\nAchieving buy-in and support from all organizations and interested parties involved in \nthe SFM system of interest is important for the success of the vulnerability assessment. \n\nIdentifying a strong champion is another key aspect of success (Johnston and Edwards \n\n2013).1.4.2     The Practice\nWorksheet 1.3 (Con˜rm the scope of the assessment)\n guides you in examining the \n\nresources required to undertake the assessment as de˛ned. If you are unable to secure all \n\nof the necessary resources, you may need to prioritize and focus on speci˛c aspects of the \n\nproblem identi˛ed in\n Worksheet 1.1\n. If the scope changes, a new purpose and outcome \n\nstatement should be prepared.\nIt may be necessary to garner further support, both ˛nancial and political, to conduct the \nvulnerability assessment as de˛ned. Creating a short, clear summary of the vulnerability \n\nassessment project may be useful for presenting the assessment concepts to decision \n\nmakers and other interested parties in e˚orts to gain support. \nA lesson learned from \nforestry vulnerability \nassessment case studies \n(Johnston and \n \nEdwards 2013)\nIdentifying a strong champion \nof the vulnerability assessment is \n\none key aspect to success. \nClimate Change and Sustainable Forest Managment in Canada:  \n 22  Chapter 1\n A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making\n', 'Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Management in Canada:\n A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making\n Chapter 1  \n23A basic approach\nIf you are doing a quick or cursory assessment that involves only in-house resources, focus \nthe scope by identifying and securing those resources that are available in-house, and keep \n\nthe spatial scale of the assessment small.\nA comprehensive \n\napproach\nDevelop an inventory of internal and external resources that is as comprehensive as \n\npossible. The scope and complexity of an assessment is often dictated by the resources \n\navailable, so be as thorough as possible in preparing your inventory.\nOperational \n\nconsiderations\n  Regularly revisit your inventory of available resources. The availability of resources may \n\nchange over time, so review resource requirements regularly and be on the lookout for \n\nopportunities to take advantage of additional resources.\nStrategic considerations\n  If resources are limited, do not be dismayed. Although having more resources may increase \n\nthe information available to serve as a basis for the assessment, there will remain many \n\nirreducible uncertainties related to climate change. Focusing available resources into a \n\nﬁsmartﬂ process may pay more dividends than throwing a lot of resources at an ill-conceived \n\nprocess. Resource constraints can help to focus e˚orts, prioritize activities, and stimulate the \n\ndevelopment of innovative methods for assessing vulnerability and adaptation options.\nChapter 1\n Completion Check-in\nHas the assessment team:  \n  Understood the reasons for doing an SFM vulnerability assessment?\n   Developed a clear statement of purpose for the assessment and a statement of \nexpected outcomes?\n  Described the spatial extent and forest structure of the area of interest?\n  Described the decision-making scope and actors within the SFM system of interest?\n   Assessed whether the available resources match the purpose and expected \noutcomes?\n  Con˛rmed the scope of the assessment?\n   Made an explicit decision to go forward with the vulnerability assessment and \nadaptation process?\nThe assessment team may also wish to:\n   Develop a team charter and work plan detailing responsibilities and timelines for \nindividuals and organizations participating in the assessment\n   Develop a communications plan to ensure that decision makers and other \ninterested parties (e.g., stakeholders) are kept informed of the purpose and progress \n\nof the assessment ', '1.5 Literature Cited\n[CCFM] Canadian Council of Forest Ministers. 2003.

As such, changes in \n\nclimate have not been considered as a major factor a˚ecting long-term decisions (see \n\nsidebar Climate terms\n).  The climate measures that are important to document are those that might a˚ect the \n SFM system.

Climate trends are \n\nderived from statistical analysis of historical climate data.\n2.2.2     The Practice\nIn most places in Canada, the climate has changed during recent decades. A national \n\nassessment of climate change impacts reported by Lemmen et al. (2008) provided \n\nnational- and regional-scale information about historical climate changes, known as \n\nﬁtrendsﬂ (see section for national information in Information Resources box, below). More \n\ndetailed regional or local information may be available for speci˛c areas from national \n\nor regional climate information centers (see sections for western and eastern Canada in \n\nInformation Resources box, below).\nThe climate information that has been collected by the Meteorological Service of Canada \nat weather stations across the country has been analyzed to generate ﬁclimate normalsﬂ for \n\nthese station locations. Climate normals describe the average conditions over a 30-year \n\nperiod. Normals are available for three overlapping 30-year periods from 1961Œ1990 up \n\nto the most recent period of 1981Œ2010 (1961Œ1990, 1971Œ2000, 1981Œ2010). Comparing \n\nselected climate variables for the three climate normal periods may help to illustrate \n\nchanges in climate. \nIt can also be helpful to \n\ncollect climate measures \n\nfor recent extreme weather \n\nevents (e.g., heavy rain or \n\nsnow, drought, windstorm). \n\nRecent global analyses by \n\nField et al. (2012) provide \n\naccepted methodologies \n\nfor describing the \n\nfrequency and severity \n \nof these events.\nHINT', 'In addition, detailed historical climate data can be downloaded and analyzed for individual \nstations across Canada. Graphs of annual mean temperature and precipitation are helpful \n\nto illustrate local climate variability and trends. Analysis of these data should be conducted \n\nwith the advice of a climate specialist. \nObservations by individuals who have spent a lot of time (e.g., several decades) in your \nSFM area are also valuable for describing changes in local climate conditions or extreme \n\nweather-related events (see sidebar \nHow important are local observations?\n). These \n\nindividuals are likely to have observed e˚ects of climate change or extreme weather \n\nevents that may not be obvious from analysis of climate data. Human memory is not \n\nalways reliable, however, so climate data should be sought to corroborate any changes \n\nthat are thought to have created signi˛cant ecological, economic, cultural, or social \n\nimpacts. This sharing and linking of local, traditional, and scienti˛c knowledge can foster \n\nongoing exchanges, facilitate continuous learning, and provide momentum for e˚ective \n\nand practical adaptation responses (Gray 2012). \nHow Important are Local Observations?\nPeople who work day-to-day in climate-sensitive resource industries (e.g., \n\nforestry or agriculture) tend to have an intimate understanding of their local \n\nsurroundings and of how the current local climate a˝ects their respective \n\nmanagement systems. They often understand the local climate and have some \n\nsense of their vulnerability to climate and climate variability. \nFor example, forest managers will likely know when the most recent severe \n˜re years occurred and will recall what combination of high-temperature days \n\nand periods without rainfall contributed to them. When such relationships are \n\nestablished, it becomes easier to answer questions such as, What would happen \n\nif conditions become hotter and drier?  What would happen if the hot and dry \n\nconditions that contributed to a severe ˜re year become ﬁnormalﬂ conditions at \n\nsome point in the future?\nLong-time residents from the SFM area who spend much of their time on the \nland (e.g., hunters, backcountry recreationists, First Nations people) can also \n\nprovide valuable observations of climate and environmental changes. E˝orts \n\nto combine these observations with climate data through events such as \n\nworkshops can often lead to rewarding discussions between local residents, \n\nforest managers, and researchers. \nClimate Change and Sustainable Forest Managment in Canada:  \n 28  Chapter 2\n A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making\n', 'Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Management in Canada:\n A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making\n Chapter 2  \n29Worksheet 2.1 (Describe climatic conditions and trends)\n provides a format for \nrecording climate trends, climate normals, and sources of information about climate \n\nvariability.\nA basic approach\nAt the Government of Canada climate website (\nhttp://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_\nnormals/index_e.html\n), ˛nd climate data for at least one location that is near your SFM \n\nsystem of interest.

The forest \nsector has adapted to recent changes in markets by innovating new products for market, \n\nincreasing e˝ciency of operations, and developing new forest management practices \n\nin response to new societal values (e.g., biodiversity). Given this inherent adaptability \n\nof forest management systems in Canada, it is likely they have already adapted to any \n\nrecent changes in the climate (i.e., over the past decade or two) and any impacts these \n\nchanges may have had on forests or forest operations, and it may be helpful to identify \n\nany such adaptations. For example, have forest policies or practices been adapted in \n\nresponse to outbreaks of mountain pine beetle or other pests associated with changes in \n\nclimate? Have any changes been made to duration of winter harvest because of changes \n\nin frozen soil conditions or lake ice-in conditions (i.e., for winter roads)? Have there been \n\nany changes to the wild˛re season (e.g., earlier start dates or later end dates) that have \n\nincreased the length of time that wild˛re crews are required on active duty?

This activity can be done by a smaller assessment team or by engaging a \n\nbroader audience in a workshop setting to gather tacit knowledge of changes that might \n\nnot be well documented. You may want to start by identifying a recent unanticipated \n\nevent (e.g., a large wild˛re or insect outbreak, an extreme precipitation event, a market \n\ndownturn) and then describing how that event a˚ected your ability to manage forests \n\nsustainably and what changes to management practices or policies were made to \n\naccount for the impacts of this event.\nRecord these observations in \nWorksheet 2.3 (Describe how recent climate trends or \nchanges in forest conditions have led to changes in forest management practices)\n.', '2.5 Key Uncertainties and Knowledge Gaps\n2.5.1     The Theory\nClimate change is characterized by substantial uncertainty. You will likely encounter a \nnumber of knowledge gaps and uncertainties (e.g., concerning the relationship between \n\nforest conditions and climate) while completing the previous worksheets on climate and \n\nforest conditions. Key knowledge gaps and uncertainties are often a barrier to successful \n\nadaptation, as they can cause the vulnerability assessment process to stall or stop.

As \n\nwell, climate change has the potential to cause multiple, interacting impacts that occur \n\nsimultaneously. For example, changes in the risks of drought, ˛re, insect and disease \n\ndisturbance, and extreme weather, as well as changes in growth and yield, may all occur at \n\nthe same time. As a result, foresters must be able to recognize, understand, and adapt to the \n\ncumulative impacts of climate change.\nSource: Williamson et al. (2009).

The third \n\ncomponent of the vulnerability \n\nassessment framework therefore \n\ninvolves the development of \n\nscenarios of future climate and \n\nforest conditions.ﬂ\nŠWilliamson et al.

Weather and climate conditions a˚ect \n\ngrowing conditions and tree, stand, and landscape processes, as well as infrastructure \n\nstability (e.g., roads and bridges) and human activities. Climatic change will modify future \n\nweather conditions and therefore can be expected to modify forest structure, species \n\ndistribution, productivity, and disturbance patterns. Climate change will also a˚ect \n\nphysical attributes of the landscape such as permafrost, soil stability, and water regimes. \n\nSuch modi˛cations have important implications for the ability to achieve SFM objectives \n\nin the long run and for decision making today.\nThe Need for Scenarios \nFuture climate change and the e˚ects that such change may have on forest ecosystems \n\nare highly uncertain, in part because of limited, though ever-growing, knowledge of \n\nclimate systems and forest ecosystems, but also because of the impossibility of predicting \n\nfuture human behaviors and values. In this situation of uncertainty, one option is to \n\ncreate a single prediction or forecast for the future (e.g., ﬁthis is what will happenﬂ), using \n\ninformation generated by models or based on scienti˛c knowledge and inference, \n\nand then to use this prediction to make decisions. Exclusively relying on this option, \n\nhowever, has a number of limitations, including the fact that model results are subject to \n\nassumptions and inherent uncertainty, especially over the time scales relevant to forest \n\nmanagement planning. In fact, it is not possible currently, and may never be possible, to \n\ncreate a single accurate prediction of climate and SFM impacts for decades into the future, \n\nespecially at time scales relevant to operational decision making. \nClimate Change and Sustainable Forest Managment in Canada:  \n 36  Chapter 3\n A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making\n', 'Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Management in Canada:\n A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making\n Chapter 3  \n37Inability to predict future impacts with con˛dence can be a signi˛cant barrier to \nvulnerability and adaptation assessment. An alternative approach is to develop a number \n\nof plausible scenarios (e.g., ﬁthis is what might happenﬂ) describing a range of possible \n\nfutures and to use these scenarios as a foundation to guide the exploration of climate \n\nchange impacts and the implications of adaptation decisions (see ﬁCase study Œ Forest \n\nFutures projectﬂ). \nScenarios De˜ned \nThe creation of scenarios is a well-developed technique for planning under uncertainty \n\n(see sidebar The Power of Scenarios in Climate Change Adaptation\n). A scenario is \n\nnot a single prediction or forecast, which would imply that a particular outcome is likely \n\nto occur. Rather, a scenario represents one of any number of possible futures. As such, \n\nscenarios are constructed stories about conditions that could occur in the future. It is \n\nessential that scenarios be logical, internally consistent, and believable portrayals of \n\npossible future conditions. \nBerkhout et al. (2002) described approaches for scenario development in the context of \nclimate change assessment with four underlying principles for scenario analysis: \n (1)  \nrecognizing that past trends do not provide a basis for projecting the future\n (2)  \naccepting that the future cannot be predicted with certainty but that ﬁexploringﬂ \npossible futures can inform decision making\n (3)  \naccepting uncertainty and recognizing that any one of a number of di˚erent \n\nfutures could occur \n (4)  \nacknowledging that local knowledge is fundamentally important for successful \n\nscenario development.\nThe Power of \nScenarios in Climate \nChange Adaptation\nBy illustrating possible future \nsettings, scenarios can be \n\nused as a tool for long-\n\nterm planning and decision \n\nmaking in the present. They \n\nshift the analytical focus \n\naway from estimating the \n\nmost likely path, which is \n\nunknown in a changing \n\nclimate, toward determining \n\nthe range of consequences \n\nof potential changes and \n\nthe most appropriate \n\nadaptations across these \n\ndi˝erent situations (i.e., robust \n\nadaptation options).

The Forest Futures project used a structured process to develop \n\nscenarios for ﬁplausibleﬂ futures across a range of uncertain conditions, including climate change, \n\nand to explore the implications of those scenarios for the many bene˛ts that Canadians derive \n\nfrom forested lands. \nCentral to the project were a series of national and regional workshops used to identify the \ndrivers of future change, to de˛ne plausible scenarios, and to analyze those futures from various \n\nperspectives. The process was designed to involve a large number of people from many forest \n\nstakeholder groups and to integrate their expertise and insight into the project™s outcomes. \nThe overall objective of the Forest Futures project was to produce a set of documents that inform \nthe scenarios and analyses, which can in turn be used to inform decision making by industry, \n\ngovernments, and other groups interested in Canadian forests. \nThe products of the Forest Futures projectŠscenario descriptions, research papers describing \ndrivers, workshop proceedings, and analysis documentsŠare available online at: \n \nhttp://www.sfmn.ales.ualberta.ca/en/Research/ForestFutures/ForestFuturesDocuments.aspx\n. ', '3.2 Develop and Describe Future Climate Scenarios\n3.2.1     The Theory\nClimate change scenarios are derived from climate models, which are in turn driven \nby projections of changes in atmospheric greenhouse gases (primarily carbon dioxide) \n\nresulting from alternative scenarios of future socioeconomic development. There are many \n\nplausible future climate scenarios because there are a number of di˚erent climate models \n\nand many possible scenarios of socioeconomic development. \nThe resolution of most global climate models is too coarse for use in vulnerability \nassessments of SFM. Methods such as downscaling can be used to produce climate \n\nscenarios at a scale more useful for assessing SFM vulnerability. Price et al. (2011) \n\npresented a series of high-resolution interpolations of climate scenarios for Canada. Many \n\nregional climate centers (e.g., Paci˛c Climate Impacts Consortium, Ouranos) are excellent \n\nsources of climate information and scenarios. Additionally, Price and Isaac (2012) have \n\npresented a summary of scenario development processes for SFM. \n3.2.2     The Practice\nThe ˛rst step in developing scenarios is to decide on a small number of climate change \n\nscenarios (e.g., two to four) representing a range of plausible climate futures for your SFM \n\nsystem. There are several ways to create climate change scenarios for the SFM system:\n   \nUse ﬁo˚-the-shelfﬂ climate projections for the area encompassing the SFM unit, which \nare available from research centers such as the Paci˛c Climate Impacts Consortium \n\nand Ouranos. The Canadian Forest Service and some provincial and territorial forest \n\nservices have signi˛cant resources available to project climate changes and impacts \n\non forests (see the description of the Canadian Forest Service™s Forest Change \n\ninitiative, in section 2.3.2). \n   \nInvolve analysts who can work with the available datasets of climate change \n\nprojections to create information for the SFM area.\n   \nInclude climate experts on the assessment project team to explore and expand on \n\nthe available data. \nE˚orts should be made to align the timeframes for reporting within the climate change \n\nscenarios with the timeframes for assessing SFM impacts. The following two approaches \n\nhave been used in practice: \n (1)  \nAssess a short-term and a long-term timeframe (e.g., 20 years, using the climate \nchange results for the 2020s, and the end of the century, using results for the \n\n2080s).

You might select more \n\nscenarios, but as a general rule the analysis should have a minimum of three scenarios, \n\none of which might be current climate (as a ﬁstatus quoﬂ scenario). \nIt is suggested that scenarios be described by simple names, such as low, moderate, \nand high change to represent an exploration of di˚erences in the rate of change (e.g., \n\nthe change in mean annual temperature). You may choose to explore di˚erences in \n\ncombinations of temperature and precipitation change (such as warmer and wetter, \n\nwarmer and drier) or combinations re˜ecting di˚erent rates of change in temperature and \n\nprecipitation (such as faster warming over time; slower warming over time).\nCon˜dence and Uncertainty\nUncertainties have always been a factor in forest management decisions in Canada, in part because of the long \n\nlifespan of the country™s common tree species. The pace and scale of climate change simply increases the scope and \n\nimplications of these uncertainties. \nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (Parry et al. 2007) de˜ned uncertainty as ﬁan expression of the \ndegree to which a value (e.g., the future state of the climate system) is unknown.ﬂ Uncertainty can result from lack of \n\ninformation or from disagreement about what is known or even knowable. Uncertainty is a reality in vulnerability \n\nassessments, given that no one knows exactly how the climate may change or how ecological, infrastructure, or \n\nhuman systems will respond to change in a particular location (Glick et al. 2011).\nVulnerability assessments aim to understand and manage, rather than overcome, as much of the full range of \nuncertainty related to climate change as is practicable. At the end of the assessment, uncertainty may appear \n\nto have expanded, but this impression may relate largely to a better understanding of the underlying factors \n\n(Parry et al. 2007). In the case of vulnerability assessment of SFM, it is likely that the nature of the SFM systemŠits \n\ncomponents and the types of interactions among themŠwill be better understood. \nExplicitly characterizing the level of con˜dence in a speci˜c information source and in assessment outcomes \nclari˜es where uncertainties are greatest.  However, when it comes to future climate change scenarios, remember \n\nthat ﬁall models are wrongﬂ and that the ﬁoutlierﬂ may be the most accurate.\nDespite uncertainties about the timing and magnitude of climate change, several authors (Lemmen et al. 2008; \nGlick et al. 2011; Peterson et al. 2011) have concluded that su˚cient information exists to begin to adaptŠwe \n\nneed not be paralyzed by lingering uncertainties. Opportunity now exists to explore these uncertainties in a \n\nstructured manner, such as suggested within this guidebook, and to proactively mainstream adaptation into forest \n\nmanagement plans, practices, and institutions. \nFor more information on uncertainty and vulnerability assessment, see chapter V, ﬁAddressing uncertainty in \nvulnerability assessments,ﬂ in Glick et al. (2011). \n', 'A basic approach\nUse the practitioner and local knowledge existing within your assessment team to describe \na range of possible climate scenarios for the future. You may want to focus on the same \n\nchange in climate (e.g., warmer and drier) over time, with variation in the degree or rate of \n\nchange over time (e.g., minor change, moderate change, large change). Alternatively, you \n\nmay want to look at a range of potential changes in climate (e.g., warmer and drier, warmer \n\nand wetter). The scenarios you choose should be relevant to your local or regional area. The \n\nidea is not to be predictive in your estimates of change but to describe a range of future \n\nclimates. You will assess the sensitivity of SFM objectives to these changes in chapter 4.\nA comprehensive \n\napproach\nInclude a climate expert on the project team, who will prepare locally focused climate \n\nchange projections and information. Expand the climate variables in the projections \n\nbeyond temperature and precipitation to include factors that participants identify as being \n\nimportant to SFM, such as wind speed, frequency of freezeŒthaw cycles, changes in seasonal \n\ntemperature and precipitation, ˛re weather index (FWI\na) values, and climate moisture index \n(CMI\nb).Operational \n\nconsiderations  \nSeasonal conditions are crucial to operational decisions, making it important to report \n\nseasonal as well as annual projections. If possible, include in the climate scenarios seasonal \n\nclimate variables that a˚ect operational decisions. \nStrategic considerations  \nIt is essential to encourage reasonable expectations about the certainty of future climate \n\nchange projections. Some participants may expect to receive detailed projections for \n\nlocalized situations (e.g., a community forest area) and others may be discouraged by what \n\nthey perceive as large uncertainties in the projections. In either case, it is important to \n\nremind participants that the purpose of the assessment is to explore what could happen if \n\nany of the projected range of climates were to occur in the future.\na For information on the Fire Weather Index (FWI) see http://cw˛s.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/background/summary/fwi. Many provincial and territorial departments \nresponsible for wild˛res maintain FWI data records.\nb The Climate Moisture Index (CMI) was originally described by Hogg (1994, 1997) as a method for assessing di˚erences in moisture regimes using simple \n\nclimate data (temperature and precipitation).\nClimate Change and Sustainable Forest Managment in Canada:  \n 40  Chapter 3\n A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making\n', 'Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Management in Canada:\n A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making\n Chapter 3  \n413.3 Develop and Describe Forest Impact Scenarios\n3.3.1     The Theory\nForest ecosystems are sensitive to climate and will be a˚ected, both directly and indirectly, \nby changes in temperature, precipitation, and frequency of extreme weather and weather-\n\nrelated events (e.g., droughts, ˜oods, wild˛res, pest outbreaks, tree diseases). Potential \n\nforest impacts will depend on the extent of climate change (i.e., exposure) and the \n\nsensitivity of the forest to such change. Additionally, forest ecosystems are complex and \n\nconsist of many interactions and feedbacks that make it di˝cult to predict the impacts \n\nof future climate change, particularly given the uncertainty in the rate and amount of \n\nfuture climate change. One approach to dealing with this uncertainty is to develop a \n\nrange of potential forest impacts based on multiple future climate scenarios (see sidebar \n\nCon˜dence and Uncertainty\n).Williamson et al. (2008) summarized the potential impacts of climate change on Canada™s \nforests and forest ecosystems at a broad scale. However, for many SFM vulnerability \n\nassessments, a ˛ner-scale analysis of climate change impacts on forests may be required. \n\nThe scienti˛c literature is rich with information about the impacts of climate change on \n\nforest ecosystems. Also, numerous modeling approaches and tools are available that can \n\nbe used to estimate climate change impacts on forests. \nMany of the vulnerability assessment case studies highlighted by Johnston and Edwards \n(2013) used both detailed modeling e˚orts and forest impact scenarios generated by local \n\nforest practitioners to develop a range of potential impacts to di˚erent future climates. \n\nHalofsky et al. (2011) and Swanston et al. (2011) have also provided relevant examples of \n\nhow to develop forest ecosystem impact scenarios for use in vulnerability assessment.\n3.3.2.     The Practice\nUse Worksheet 3.2 (Develop and describe forest impact scenarios)\n to record \n\nthe range of potential impacts on forests, given the climate scenarios developed in \n\nWorksheet 3.1 (Develop and describe future climate scenarios)\n.Potential forest impacts will depend on the extent of climate change (i.e., exposure) and \nthe sensitivity of the forest that is a˚ected by climate change. Williamson et al. (2008, \n\nFigure 2) outlined a method to map the potential impacts of climate change on forests. \n\nAdditionally, the Canadian Forest Service™s Forest Change initiative (described in section \n\n2.3.2) is producing knowledge products and tools related to forest impacts from climate \n\nchange across Canada. These knowledge products and tools are being developed with \n\nforest practitioners in mind, with the goal of assisting them in developing forest impact \n\nscenarios. Many provincial forest services, climate consortiums (e.g., Paci˛c Climate \n\nImpacts Consortium, Ouranos, ClimateWNA), and universities also have forest impact \n\nmodeling resources available for forest practitioners to use when considering climate \n\nchange. Use these products in conjunction with practitioner knowledge and expert \n\nopinion to develop scenarios of forest impacts. You may also wish to consult or partner \n\nwith academic researchers to investigate potential climate changeŒrelated forest impacts.\nFrom the assessment \nframework–\nﬁThe second step in developing \nforest impact scenarios is to \n\nevaluate the response of forests \n\nand forest ecosystems to each \n\nclimate scenario (i.e., the climate \n\nchange impacts). This response \n\n(i.e., the e˜ects on the forest) will \nbe a function of the magnitude of the change in climate under a \nparticular scenario (i.e., exposure) \n\ncombined with the degree to \n\nwhich the forests are able to \n\ntolerate or adapt to the \n \ndegree of change in climate \n \nunder a particular scenario \n \n(i.e., sensitivity).ﬂ\nŠWilliamson et al.

The scenarios you choose should be relevant to your local or regional area. The \n\nidea is not to be predictive in your estimates of change but rather to describe a range of \n\npossible futures. \nA comprehensive \n\napproach\nA more comprehensive approach would be to include on the vulnerability assessment team \n\na number of forest resource and modeling experts who can examine a range of potential \n\nclimate change impacts on the forests within the SFM area of interest and beyond. The \n\nuse of multiple forest impact models combined with tacit or expert knowledge is a useful \n\nmethod for exploring potential future forest conditions.\nOperational \n\nconsiderations  \nThe impacts of climate change on forests may have implications for forestry operations. \n\nSuch implications may include reduced access to forest resources (e.g., shorter winter \n\nroad conditions), increased salvage operations, reduced timber or ˛ber quality for mills, or \n\nreduced tree-regeneration success. Consider forest planning, harvesting, and regeneration \n\npractices when developing forest impact scenarios.\nStrategic considerations  \nKeep in mind that no model or expert can accurately predict the future climate and forest \n\nconditions in that climate. Exploring a range of possible futures is a method for developing \n\nmanagement options that are robust across a range of future forest conditions. Changes \n\nto forests and forest conditions in the future may present new opportunities for the SFM \n\nsystem of interest. It is therefore important to consider potential positive impacts of climate \n\nchange as well.\nSeveral technical aspects should be considered in the creation of forest impact scenarios. \nThe amount of scienti˛c analysis and modeling required will often depend on how \n\nmuch information (data) exists for the SFM area of interest, the availability of resources to \n\nmodel forest ecosystems and their responses to changes in climate, and the degree of \n\nﬁevidenceﬂ required for making decisions. Keep in mind that scenarios are not predictions, \n\nbut possible futures; therefore, possible future forest impact scenarios can be developed \n\nsimply through discussion with colleagues, detailed models, or a combination of the two. \nThe forest impact scenarios developed here will be used in the next step of the \nassessment to assess the consequences of these impacts on the ability to achieve SFM \n\nobjectives.\nClimate Change and Sustainable Forest Managment in Canada:  \n 42  Chapter 3\n A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making\n', 'Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Management in Canada:\n A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making\n Chapter 3  \n433.4 Literature Cited\nBerkhout, F.; Hertin, J.; Jordan, A. 2002.

Adaptive capacity can \n\nmoderate impacts to reduce the vulnerability of a system to climate change. \nAdaptive capacity is a crucial element of climate change vulnerability assessment. A \nsystem with high adaptive capacity can identify adaptation requirements and implement \n\nadaptation actions to reduce its vulnerability to climate change and to nonclimatic \n\nstressors and to take action on opportunities. \nAssessment of Adaptive Capacity \nAssessment of adaptive capacity remains one of the more challenging aspects of \n\nvulnerability analysis. The measurement and analysis of adaptive capacity is a relatively \n\nnew and evolving area of study in general and a new area of consideration in forestry-\n\nrelated assessments. The relevance of ﬁadaptive capacityﬂ in the day-to-day operations \n\nof Canadian SFM systems is increasing, in part because management environments \n\nare becoming more complex, uncertainty is increasing, and the pace of changes \nClimate Change \nAdaptation and \nAdaptive Capacity\nIn a climate change \nvulnerability assessment, \n\nadaptive capacity and \n\nadaptation are not \n\nequivalent.\nAdaptation\n describes the \naction taken to reduce \n\nnegative impacts related \n\nto climate change and to \n\nincrease the magnitude \n\nand likelihood of positive \n\nimpacts (e.g., research and \n\ntraining to learn more about \n\nclimate change). \nAdaptive capacity\n is the condition of the system \n\nbeing assessed (e.g., low \n\nawareness of climate \n\nchange or limited ˜nancial \n\nresources).\nClimate Change and Sustainable Forest Managment in Canada:  \n 48  Chapter 4\n A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making\n', 'Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Management in Canada:\n A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making\n Chapter 4  \n49a˚ecting forest management seems to be rising (see Case Study Œ ﬁNational assessment \nof adaptive capacity and sustainable forest managementﬂ). The combined e˚ect is \n\nincreasing recognition of the need to be adaptive and to understand and develop the \n\nsystem™s inherent capacity to adapt. Adaptive capacity can be assessed a number of \n\nways. Williamson and Isaac (2013) summarized the current literature on adaptive capacity \n\nrelevant to SFM and presented a framework of the dimensions of adaptive capacity along \n\nwith relevant assessment approaches.\nCase Study - National \nassessment of adaptive \n\ncapacity and sustainable \n\nforest management\nBased largely on insights from extensive discussions and interviews with Canadian forest \n\nmanagers and other practitioners, Johnston et al. (2010) reported the following key \n\n˛ndings:     \nAwareness of the issue and perception of urgency\n Œ Awareness of climate change \nas an important issue for forest management is increasing in Canada, although site-\n\nspeci˛c impacts and adaptation options are not yet well understood. \n      \nRange of technological options available to decision makers\n Œ The availability of \n\ntechnological options for adaptation is variable, and cost is often a limiting factor. \n      \nEconomic resources\n Œ Investment in innovation in the Canadian forest sector is \ngenerally low, which limits the ability to develop innovative solutions to address \n\nclimate change impacts. In addition, resources are often lacking to support \n\nvulnerability assessments and adaptation planning. \n      \nInstitutional factors\n (e.g., design and structure, ˜exibility, ability to e˝ciently \nallocate resources to adaptation, degree of autonomy in making adaptation choices) \n\nŒ Institutional barriers are an important limitation to implementing adaptation \n\noptions. Analyses of current policy could help in identifying features likely to hinder \n\nadaptation. Canadian forest management has a number of institutions that increase \n\nadaptive capacity (e.g., Forest Products Association of Canada, the model forest \n\nnetwork, forest certi˛cation programs, the national forest strategy, and professional \n\nassociations).      \nHuman and social capital of adaptors\n (e.g., skills, education, experience, networks) \n\nŒ Although the adaptive capacity of the forestry profession is generally high, a lack of \n\nscienti˛c capacity is an important constraint to planning for climate change. In some \n\nlocations, the lack of human capacity is seen as a constraint.\n      \nKnowledge and access to information\n Œ Research capacity related to forest \n\nmanagement is high in Canada, but to date researchers have not addressed climate \n\nchange comprehensively. Also, there is a lack of scienti˛c capacity relative to \n\nunderstanding and dealing with climate change in the Canadian forest sector, and \n\na lack of information at spatial and temporal scales relevant to forest management \n\nplanning and decision making. New modeling tools will assist in developing a \n\nbetter understanding of the impacts of climate change and the role of potential \n\nmanagement interventions in adaptation activities.\n      \nAbility to manage risk\n Œ Forestry companies, like any other type of business, engage \n\nin risk management as part of normal business practice. However, some aspects of \n\nforest management, such as long-term commitments favoring certain tree species \n\nduring reforestation, make risk management more di˝cult. \n', 'Case Study - Kamloops \nFuture Forest Strategy\nThe Kamloops Future Forest Strategy emphasized ﬁmanagement adaptive capacityﬂ in a \n\nvulnerability assessment for a forest area of 2.7 million hectares in central British Columbia. \n\nManagement adaptive capacity was de˛ned as encompassing current legislation, policies, \n\nadministrative structures, and other factors that shape the way forest management functions \n\nin the area, including its in˜uence on the management actions that forest managers are willing \n\nand/or able to implement.  \nFollowing the identi˛cation of possible management actions to reduce the sensitivity of \necosystems, adaptive capacity was considered by evaluating barriers to implementation. The \n\nfollowing ˛ve broad themes or general barriers emerged: \n(1) lack of a comprehensive strategic planning process \n\n(2) more costly reforestation \n\n(3) more costly or break-even harvesting \n\n(4) need for ongoing stand management (e.g., beyond free growing) \n(5) requirement for government to take on increased management risk. \nSource: Details on the Kamloops Future Forest Strategy can be found at \n http://k2project.˛les.wordpress.com/2010/01/kamloops-future-forest-strategy-june25-09.pdf\n4.3.2     The Practice\nAdaptive capacity assessments rely largely on interviews, discussions, and surveys \nduring which individual practitioners and policy specialists share their views about their \n\nindividual and collective adaptive capacity, based on a list of assets or determinants taken \n\nfrom the literature. Assessment of adaptive capacity is highly contextual and details of \n\nthe assessment will vary depending on the focus of the assessment (see ﬁCase study Œ \n\nKamloops Future Forest Strategyﬂ).\nWorksheet 4.2 (Evaluate adaptive capacity of the SFM system)\n provides guidance \non assessing adaptive capacity characteristics, based on the framework proposed by \n\nWilliamson and Isaac (2013). The worksheet consists of a series of questions that users can \n\nask themselves and their organizations to help understand their capacity to adapt both \n\ngenerally and speci˛cally in relation to climate change.  \n4.4 Assess Current and Future SFM Vulnerability\n4.4.1     The Theory\nAccording to the IPCC, vulnerability ﬁis a function of the character, magnitude, and rate of \n\nclimate change and variation to which a system is exposed, its sensitivity, and its adaptive \n\ncapacityﬂ (Parry et al. 2007). Systems that experience relatively low level of impacts, either \n\nbecause they are not exposed to signi˛cant climate changes or variability or because they \n\nare insensitive to these changes (or a combination of these factors) have low vulnerability. \n\nWhere there is potential for large impacts on a system because of high exposure or high \n\nsensitivity (or both), high adaptive capacity can reduce the degree to which the system \n\nis vulnerable. However, in cases where an impact critically a˚ects the ability to meet \nClimate Change and Sustainable Forest Managment in Canada:  \n 50  Chapter 4\n A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making\n', 'Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Management in Canada:\n A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making\n Chapter 4  \n51objectives and there is no potential adaptive capacity, the system has high vulnerability. \nA high level of vulnerability may lead to signi˛cant adverse e˚ects on natural and human \n\nsystems. \nThe outcomes of a vulnerability assessment consist of relative vulnerability rankings and \na documented understanding of the speci˛c factors contributing to this vulnerability. \n\nGlick et al. (2011) emphasized that a vulnerability assessment is not an end point; rather, \n\nit is a source of information to be incorporated into planning and decision making. They \n\ndescribed vulnerability rankings as an intermediate step, used in setting management and \n\nplanning priorities and crafting adaptation options, including monitoring and allocating \n\nscarce resources. \n4.4.2     The Practice\nAssessing the vulnerability of SFM objectives is a subjective practice based on the best \n\navailable information and knowledge of potential impacts on the objectives and the \n\nassessment of general adaptive capacity. There is no exact science for this process, and it \n\nis best to work in a group or to conduct a workshop to estimate the vulnerability of your \n\nSFM objectives.\nWorksheet 4.3 (Assess current and future vulnerability)\n combines the impacts on \nSFM objectives determined in \nWorksheet 4.1 (Assess current and future impacts on \n\nSFM)\n and the assessment of adaptive capacity from \nWorksheet 4.2 (Evaluate adaptive \n\ncapacity of the SFM system)\n to determine the vulnerability of SFM objectives under \n\ncurrent forest conditions and future forest impact scenarios. For example, if the impacts of \n\nclimate change on achieving a speci˛c SFM objective are ranked as high and the adaptive \n\ncapacity of the system for this objective is ranked as low, vulnerability would be ranked as \n\nhigh. It is also useful to step back from the level of individual SFM objectives and examine the \nSFM system as a whole, considering the question, ﬁUnder current forest conditions and \n\nthe range of potential future climate and forest impacts, is the SFM system vulnerable \n\nto climate change?ﬂ Use \nWorksheet 4.4 (Assess overall SFM system vulnerability)\n to \n\nsummarize your conclusions.\n4.5 Decision Point: Is Adaptation Required?\nAt this stage, the detailed vulnerability assessment is now complete.

There is little theory available on the development \n\nof adaptation options (see ﬁCase study ŒCapabilities approach to identifying adaptation \n\noptionsﬂ for one approach). The key is to develop as wide a range of options as possible, \n\ngiven the scenarios developed earlier in the vulnerability assessment process. The \n\nadaptation options can focus on a range of policy, practice, or capacity changes. The \n\noptions will be prioritized and the feasibility of implementing them assessed in chapter 6. \n5.2.2     The Practice\nAn inventory of adaptation options was compiled to aid in the development of this \n\nguidebook (see Appendix 5). This inventory was based on a review of the literature \n\n(drawn largely from Ogden and Innes 2007 and Innes et al. 2009) to identify adaptation \n\noptions previously suggested by researchers as ways of incorporating climate change \n\nconsiderations into forest management and planning. \nClimate Change and Sustainable Forest Managment in Canada:  \n 54  Chapter 5\n A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making\n', 'Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Management in Canada:\n A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making\n Chapter 5  \n55Case Study Œ Capabilities \napproach to identifying \n\nadaptation options\nAlberta™s Climate Change Adaptation Framework Manual (ESRD 2010) uses a capabilities \n\napproach to identify adaptation options. The premise behind this approach is that an \n\norganization™s capabilities for adaptation depend on options in four critical areas, each of \n\nwhich should be considered when developing a list of potential adaptation options:\n Governance\n Œ These options address management, policies, and processes to direct \nthe organization™s activities and cover policy, resource decisions, and facilitation of cross-\n\norganization relationships.\n People\n Œ These options improve the capacity and capabilities of individuals within \n\nthe organization and also look beyond the organization to external stakeholders \n\nthrough training, recruitment and retention strategies, updated job descriptions, and \n\nperformance management.\n \n Technology\n Œ These options involve the application of science for adaptation to the \n\nenvironment, such as climate modeling software, geographic information systems, ˛eld \n\nequipment, monitoring equipment, and infrastructure.\n Process\n Œ These options address how work is done within the organization. Processes \n\nfor climate change adaptation include developing and deploying strategies, identifying \n\nand assessing risks, responding to risks, designing and testing measures, monitoring and \n\nre-evaluating progress, and continuous improvement.\nThe ˛eld of forest management adaptation is rapidly evolving, and this inventory of \nadaptation options should therefore not be considered de˛nitive or comprehensive; \n\nrather, it should be revised and updated as new knowledge is gained or as innovative \n\nideas are proposed. The inventory of potential adaptation options and the worksheets \n\nassociated with this step are categorized according to relevant CCFM SFM criteria.   \nIn addition to these suggestions and any that have been collected during the vulnerability \nassessment process, the assessment team should also explicitly consider options to \n\nstrengthen adaptive capacity to achieve each of the SFM objectives. The team should \n\nrevisit the adaptive capacity assessment \n(Worksheet 4.2. Evaluate adaptive capacity \n\nof the SFM system)\n and identify adaptive capacity de˛cits that are speci˛c to achieving \n\nindividual SFM objectives. For example, a knowledge de˛cit that can be ˛lled by ongoing \n\nsupport from a climate specialist through analysis of future extreme rainfall to understand \n\npotential impacts on soil erosion could be recorded as an adaptation option under \n\nyour SFM objective related to maintaining soil productivity. Referring back to the key \n\nuncertainties and knowledge gaps identi˛ed throughout the vulnerability assessment \n\nprocess \n(Worksheet 2.4. Identify uncertainties and knowledge gaps)\n can also be a \ngreat starting point for generating adaptation options.\nWorksheet 5.1 (Develop potential adaptation options for SFM objectives)\n involves \nidentifying all potential adaptation options for your SFM system of interest. At this stage, \n\nadaptation options should not be evaluated; rather, e˚orts should be directed toward \n\nidentifying all possible options.   \n', 'A basic approach\nGather a group of interested parties to review the adaptation options listed in Appendix 5 \n(the inventory of potential adaptation options) and to brainstorm additional options to add \n\nto the list. You may also use the knowledge gaps and uncertainties identi˛ed throughout \n\nthe vulnerability assessment as a starting point. Engaging with others who are working on \n\nvulnerability assessment of SFM may also be useful; for example, see the Forestry Adaptation \n\nCommunity of Practice \n<http://www.ccadaptation.ca/facop>\n. A comprehensive \n\napproach\nA more comprehensive approach might include a review of the relevant literature, keeping \n\nin mind that adaptation is a ﬁlocalﬂ activity and that adaptations identi˛ed in the literature \n\nmay not ˛t with the speci˛c ecological or institutional context of your assessment area.\nAnother approach to eliciting adaptation options is to conduct the ˛rst round of a Policy \nDelphi process (see, for example, \nhttp://www.climateontario.ca/LakeSimcoeDelphi.php)\n. Operational \n\nconsiderations  \nWhat options exist for adapting forest management policies and practices to reduce \n\nvulnerability to climate change? When identifying potential adaptation options, keep the \n\nfollowing guidance in mind\n Be creative and innovative. Climate change adaptation is a newly expanding area, and not \nall options are on the table yet. \n Encourage the identi˛cation of new approaches to adaptation by brainstorming. Don™t \n\nevaluate options at this stage, because doing so can limit creativity.\n Engage a variety of perspectives in this process, and consider a broad range of potential \n\nmanagement intensities and viewpoints.\nStrategic considerations  \nKeep in mind that the ultimate goal of adaptation planning is to reduce vulnerability to \n\nclimate change and thereby increase the likelihood that management objectives will be \n\nachieved. Because of the profound uncertainties associated with many of the adaptation \n\noptions, it may be important to build ˜exibility and ﬁlearning by doingﬂ into your list of \n\nadaptation options.\nSome of the identi˛ed impacts may be cross-cutting, in˜uencing several or all of the SFM \nobjectives (e.g., lack of awareness of climate change impacts among senior managers is \n\nlikely to a˚ect many objectives). A separate worksheet \n(Worksheet 5.2. Develop potential \n\nadaptation options for the overall SFM system of interest)\n is provided to develop and \n\nassess options with a view to reducing cross-cutting impacts on the SFM system.\nChanging current policies, practices, and strategies (i.e., adapting) to reduce climate \nchange vulnerabilities can focus on many areas of forest management. Two good places \n\nto start are developing options to address potential impacts on forests and to increase \n\nadaptive capacity.\nClimate Change and Sustainable Forest Managment in Canada:  \n 56  Chapter 5\n A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making\n', 'Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Management in Canada:\n A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making\n Chapter 5  \n57From the assessment \nframework–\nﬁOnce a suite of potential \nadaptations has been identi˚ed, \n\nthe next step is to assess them \n\nand select those that have \n \nthe greatest potential bene˚t \n \nfor SFM or that o˜er the \n \ngreatest promise in terms of \n\nachieving SFM (however it is \n\nde˚ned for the management \nsystem of interest), given the \n\nrealities of climate change.ﬂ\nŠWilliamson et al.

It is essential to focus on the \n\nimportance of implementing adaptation options at this stage in the adaptation process \n\nand not on the feasibility of implementing the adaptations. Assessing feasibility and \n\necological and social suitability will be addressed in chapter 6.\nOptions that support achievement of SFM objectives across the range of possible future \nscenarios are known as ﬁrobustﬂ options. Other categories of important options are ﬁno-\n\nregret,ﬂ ﬁwinŒwin,ﬂ and ﬁmust-doﬂ options. No-regret options make sense today and for \n\nall potential futures. For example, increasing awareness of climate change and climate \n\nchange impacts within your organization is likely to be a no-regret option, and very \n\nlittle will be lost if the projected climate change and impacts do not materialize. WinŒ\n\nwin options are those that can reduce vulnerability to climate change while improving \n\nor positively a˚ecting other priorities. For example, the use of assisted migration to \n\nincorporate new tree species may present the opportunity to use tree species that are \n\nmore productive, which could (hypothetically) lead to increased carbon capture. Must-do \n\noptions are those that ought to be  undertaken immediately to achieve SFM objectives \n\nunder current climate conditions and regardless of projected future climates. \n5.3.2     The Practice\nGuidance for completing the option assessment steps in \nWorksheet 5.1 (Develop \n\npotential adaptation options for SFM objectives)\n and Worksheet 5.2 (Develop \n\npotential adaptation options for the overall SFM system of interest) \nis provided \n\nbelow.\nImportance of implementing adaption option to achieve management objectives\n Œ A good starting point for climate change adaptation in the forest sector is to proactively \n\nidentify management policies and practices with a higher likelihood of achieving SFM \n\nobjectives across a wide range of potential climate futures (see ﬁCase study Œ Southwest \n\nYukonﬂ). Considering climate change vulnerabilities, how important (or bene˛cial) is it to \n\nimplement each of the adaptation options to achieve management objectives in your \n\narea? Perform this assessment both for current climate conditions and for each of the \n\nscenarios you have described. \nﬁImportantﬂ adaptation options\n Œ Determine which adaptation options can be \nconsidered robust, no-regret, winŒwin, and/or must-do (i.e., options that are important to \n\nimplement across all scenarios to achieve management objectives in your area and thus \n\nmost bene˛cial for SFM).

Although you may not wish to \n\nconsider these options for the remaining assessment steps, it is wise to keep them on \n\nyour list of potential adaptation options for use as a starting point for future reassessment \n\nof vulnerability. In addition, although these options may not be ranked as important \n\nfor addressing climate change, they may represent important views and opinions of \n\ninterested parties that can be addressed through other planning processes.\nCase Study Œ Southwest \nYukon\nA good starting point for climate change adaptation in the forest sector is to proactively \n\nidentify policies and practices with a higher likelihood of achieving management \n\nobjectives across a wide range of potential climate futures. This step should be followed by \n\nimplementation of these options and monitoring of their success in achieving objectives \n\nwithin an adaptive management context.\nA study in southwest Yukon identi˛ed locally appropriate adaptation options by tapping \ninto the experiential knowledge base of local forest practitioners while concurrently building \n\ncapacity within this community to implement the options. Thirty forest practitioners \n\ninvolved with implementation of a regional forest management plan were engaged in \n\nidentifying climate change vulnerabilities and evaluating alternative adaptation options. \n\nA structured decision-making approach was used to frame the assessment. Practitioners \n\nidenti˛ed 24 adaptation options that they considered important to implement for achieving \n\nthe regional goals and objectives of SFM in light of climate change.  \nSource: Ogden and Innes (2009). \nClimate Change and Sustainable Forest Managment in Canada:  \n 58  Chapter 5\n A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making\n', 'Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Management in Canada:\n A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making\n Chapter 5  \n59Informed Judgements\nPublic perceptions of climate change have been widely documented and have been the focus of considerable \nresearch in recent years. In addition, expert judgments (generally de˜ned as those of well-recognized researchers) \n\nhave been used to forecast and assess probabilities and risks and have provided useful insights for decision \n\nmakers, particularly in situations characterized by complexity and deep uncertainty. Although some e˝orts have \n\nbeen made to document the judgments of members of the professional and practitioner communities on matters \n\nrelated to climate change, research in this area has received considerably less attention. A notable gap is research to \n\ndocument the informed judgments of forest practitioners on priorities and mechanisms for adaptation.  \nIt may be useful for forest managers to gain experience in developing and evaluating alternative adaptation \noptions. Integrating considerations related to climate change adaptation into existing decision-making processes \n\nis called ﬁmainstreamingﬂ and can lead to ﬁwinŒwinﬂ policies, i.e., those that reduce vulnerability to climatic change \n\nwhile simultaneously addressing other priorities. It is also important for key local actors and institutions to be \n\ninvolved in mainstreaming, because they play signi˜cant roles in knowledge transfer and policy development. \n\nInterventions will be more successful if they are identi˜ed and developed by local actors, as they (the interventions) \n\nare more likely to be consistent with local priorities, goals, norms, and institutions. Conversely, a recommendation \n\ndeveloped without consultation with local communities and/or government institutions is far less likely to be \n\nadopted.\nForest practitioners play a critical role in adaptation planning. They are involved with the planning and \nmanagement of forest-based resources and frequently collaborate with ecological, economic, social, and cultural \n\nexperts, as well as holders of local, traditional, and/or scienti˜c knowledge of forest-based resources. Practitioners \n\nare well-informed, highly knowledgeable individuals whose employment or livelihood is tied to the forest sector \n\nand who are typically employed by key decision-making agencies; alternatively, they may be stakeholders who \n\nare instrumental in driving forestry decision making. Documenting the informed judgments of practitioners \n\ncould therefore provide useful insights into the state of knowledge and practice on climate adaptation and the \n\nreadiness of practitioners to engage in adaptive strategies. The applied knowledge held by forest practitioners can \n\nalso provide useful insights for decision makers while research to produce more de˜nitive results is in progress, \n\nparticularly in situations characterized by complexity and deep uncertainty (see Walker et al. [2013] for more on \n\nadaptation under deep uncertainty). \nForest practitioners work at the con˛uence of government, scienti˜c, and community knowledge and priorities \nand as such are experts in the local context. They also play an important role in developing, implementing, and/\n\nor reviewing operational forest management plans to ensure that community-directed goals and objectives \n\nof forest management are achieved. Within the experiential knowledge base of local practitioners rests an \n\napplied understanding of local priorities, goals, norms, and institutions. There are many trade-o˝s involved in \n\nforest management decision making, trade-o˝s that are well understood by those who are experts in the local \n\ncontext. This expertise is incredibly useful to an assessment of climate change vulnerabilities and the regional \n\nappropriateness of adaptation options and strategies. An exploration of practitioners™ viewpoints on adaptation \n\nmeasures in a local context also creates the opportunity to build a collective understanding of locally appropriate \n\nmeasures that might be taken to adapt to climate change. In addition, raising awareness of the range of alternative \n\nadaptation options within this community can facilitate changes in policy and practice. In this way, exposing \n\npractitioners to adaptation-related questions might help to build the necessary foundation for their incorporation \n\ninto longer-term forest management and planning-related decisions.  \nSources: Ogden and Innes (2007); Ogden and Innes (2009); Walker et al.

Of the many methods \n\navailable for prioritizing options, the most useful will depend on the decision-making \n\ncontext of your SFM system and the actors involved in the vulnerability assessment. One \n\nmethod for prioritizing adaptation options is a Policy Delphi process (as described in \n\nﬁCase study Œ Lake Simcoeﬂ in section 6.2.2), which involves the use of multiple rounds of \n\nexpert opinion, solicited through an anonymous process, to generate and re˛ne the list \n\nof potential adaptation options. Conversely, some prioritization may have already been \n\ncompleted when you assessed the importance of each adaptation option in \nWorksheet \n\n5.1 (Develop potential adaptation options for SFM objectives)\n and Worksheet 5.2 \n\n(Develop potential adaptation options for the overall SFM system of interest)\n.Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Managment in Canada:  \n 62  Chapter 6\n A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making\n', 'Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Management in Canada:\n A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making\n Chapter 6  \n63The main consideration throughout the prioritization and recommendation stages is \nwhether the adaptation helps in achieving SFM objectives across a range of potential \n\nfutures. \nInformation Source \nLim and Spanger-Siegfried (2005) identi˛ed four main methods for prioritizing adaptation \noptions:1.   CostŒbene˜t analysis\n Œ This method uses one criterionŠeconomic e˝ciencyŠto \nassess and provide an absolute measure of the desirability of alternative adaptation \n\noptions. It can identify optimal options and priorities, albeit based on a single criterion. \n\nCostŒbene˛t analysis has relatively heavy data requirements.\n2.   Multicriteria analysis\n Œ This method is suitable when more criteria are thought to be \n\nrelevant and it is not possible to quantify and evaluate the criteria in monetary terms. It \n\nis typically used to rank options. If a ﬁdo-nothing optionﬂ is one of the alternatives being \n\nevaluated, a multicriteria analysis can help to clarify whether the adaptation measure is \n\nbetter than the status quo.  Subjective judgment plays an important role in multicriteria \n\nanalysis, making its outcomes more arbitrary than those of costŒbene˛t analysis. \n3.   Cost-e˚ectiveness analysis\n ŒThis method is a form of economic analysis that compares \n\nthe relative costs and outcomes (e˚ects) of two or more courses of action. It is distinct \n\nfrom costŒbene˛t analysis, in that it does not assign a monetary value to the measure \n\nof e˚ect. Cost-e˚ectiveness analysis lies somewhere between costŒbene˛t analysis \n\nand multicriteria analysis in terms of subjectivity; it is similar to multicriteria analysis in \n\nproviding only a ranking.\n4.   Expert judgment\n Œ Expert judgments have been used to forecast and assess \n\nprobabilities and risks and have provided useful insights for decision makers, particularly \n\nin situations characterized by complexity and deep uncertainty and where limited \n\ninformation is available. See box\n Informed Judgments\n in chapter 5 for a more detailed \n\ndiscussion of this approach. \nOnce the prioritization step is complete, the priority adaptation options should be \nassessed for ecological and social suitability and for feasibility of implementation. If the \n\noptions are deemed suitable and feasible, the adaptations are ﬁupgradedﬂ from options \n\nto recommendations. Ste-Marie (2014) has summarized the facets to consider when \n\nassessing assisted migration as an adaptation option, but the points presented in that \n\nsummary are relevant to any adaptation options being considered. \n6.2.2     The Practice\nFew forest management adaptation planning processes have reached the stage of \n\nprioritizing adaptation options, so limited guidance is available as to what will work in \n\nvarious contexts. One recent experience, the Lake Simcoe Vulnerability Assessment, is \n\ndescribed in the case study below. \nCase Study Œ Lake Simcoe\nThe vulnerability assessment for Lake Simcoe, Ontario, involved a Policy Delphi process to \nboth elicit a wide range of adaptation options and to assess and re˛ne the list of potential \n\noptions. The original list developed during the assessment process presented over 900 \n\npotential adaptation options. Use of the Delphi process allowed participants to reduce \n\nthe number of options to a more feasible number (see \nhttp://www.climateontario.ca/\n\nLakeSimcoeDelphi.php\n). ', 'The ˛rst step in \nWorksheet 6.1 (Prioritize adaptation options)\n is to describe the process \nthat will be used to prioritize the options created in chapter 5. This process will likely \n\ndepend on the existing decision-making context. The second step is to list the prioritized \n\nadaptation options by SFM objective and describe why these adaptation options are \n\npriorities for implementation.\nWorksheet 6.2 (Recommend priority adaptation options for implementation)\n provides \nguidance for assessing and selecting priority adaptation options to be implemented. \nPotential barriers and con˛icts\n Œ For all of the adaptation options selected as having \npriority, potential con˜icts with implementation must be assessed. This process involves \n\nconsidering the ecological suitability, social acceptability, and economic and institutional \n\nfeasibility of the adaptations. In some cases, feasibility may be limited by identi˛able \n\nbarriers or constraints to adaptation (see Moser and Ekstrom 2010). For example, the \n\nuncertainty of adaptation success may be too high to justify implementation without \n\nfurther research. Such constraints should be noted and described, because the preferred \n\nadaptation option in such a case might be to remove or reduce the barriers and \n\nconstraints. Infeasibility could also result from the social unacceptability of a potential \n\nadaptation option (e.g., introduction of exotic tree species at a large scale). \nIf an adaptation option is deemed infeasible, it may be worth determining whether the \noption can be changed in a way that would make it feasible. If that possibility exists, then \n\nthe adaptation option can be adjusted; otherwise, the adaptation option is rejected and \n\nalternatives should be sought. Priority adaptation options should also be assessed for \n\ncon˜icts with the achievement of other SFM objectives. \nRecommended adaptations\n Œ Once it has been determined that a particular \nsuite of adaptation options will bene˛t SFM objectives, yield acceptable outcomes, \n\nand be feasible, then the adaptation options can be upgraded from ﬁoptionsﬂ to \n\nﬁrecommendations.ﬂ Keep in mind that adaptation options ranked as very important \n\nfor achieving an SFM objective in a changing climate may not be the most suitable \n\nor the most feasible options. You may need to weigh the importance, or bene˛t, of \n\nimplementing the option against the ease or di˝culty of implementation. \nTimeframe for implementation\n ŒDetermine the timeframe for implementation of the \nrecommended option. Implementation timeframes may be related to existing opportunities \n\n(e.g., the start of a new forest management planning cycle), the status of the option as \n\na ﬁmust-doﬂ adaptation, the impending disappearance of a funding source to support \n\nthe implementation, or other factors. Certain adaptation options may not need to be \n\nimplemented immediately but can be delayed until the timing is right.\nﬁAchievabilityﬂ of SFM objectives\n  Œ Keep in mind that it may not be possible to reach \nall management objectives through adjustments to forest management policies and \n\npractices. Climate change will likely result in some impacts to forests which, regardless \n\nof the intensity of forest management e˚orts, will preclude the achievement of certain \n\nobjectives. In these cases, the forest management objectives themselves should be \n\nrevisited by asking the question, ﬁWith implementation of the recommended adaptations, \n\ndo we expect to be able to achieve our SFM objectives?ﬂ If the answer is ﬁno,ﬂ you should \n\nconsider either identifying additional adaptations or revising your SFM objectives. \nClimate Change and Sustainable Forest Managment in Canada:  \n 64  Chapter 6\n A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making\n', 'Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Management in Canada:\n A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making\n Chapter 6  \n65A basic approach\nHave the vulnerability assessment team assess the options on the basis of their experience \nand knowledge, with the understanding that the team represents only a small proportion of \n\nthe interested parties within the SFM system of interest.\nA comprehensive \n\napproach\nSeek participation of and perspectives from a diverse group of interested parties (e.g., \n\nstakeholders, public, other government departments) in assessing potential con˜icts and \n\nprioritizing adaptations.\nOperational \n\nconsiderations  \nIndividuals responsible for forest planning, harvesting operations, and mill operations should \n\nbe included in the assessment of suitability and feasibility. Individuals who work on these \n\ntasks daily often know the details required to implement new approaches and techniques. \n\nThis step in the adaptation process can also be an opportunity for all interested parties to \n\nbring forward creative solutions and new opportunities. \nStrategic considerations  \nDon™t become overwhelmed by a lack of data or tremendous uncertainties. Use the \n\ninformation that is available, but also plan to rely on expert judgments and/or the informed \n\njudgments of local forest practitioners to develop recommendations and priorities. Look for \n\nﬁno-regretﬂ adaptations (i.e., actions that make sense now and in the future, regardless of \n\nwhat the climate might be).\nFrom the assessment \nframework–\nﬁAdaptation means a \nchange in the way of doing \n\nbusiness. Implementation \n\nof an adaptation may \ntherefore require changes in \n\nplanning, procedures, policies, \n\nregulations, legislation, \n\ninvestments, protocols, \n\nguidelines, standards, and \n\noperational methods. However, \n\nimplementation does not \nencompass any change \n \nin SFM objectives.ﬂﬂ\nŠWilliamson et al. (2012)\n6.3 Mainstream Adaptation Priorities\n6.3.1     The Theory\nNow that you have developed a list of adaptation priorities, it is time to transform \nthem into actions by incorporating them into the day-to-day operations of relevant \n\norganizations. Integrating adaptations into regular business practice is known as \n\nﬁmainstreaming.ﬂ This process also encourages all members of an organization to become \n\nknowledgeable about climate change and its potential impacts. \nFundamentally, adaptation is about doing things di˚erently. Implementation may require \na change in ways of doing business, such as alterations in planning, procedures, policies, \n\nregulations, legislation, investments, protocols, guidelines, training, and operational \n\nmethods. The changes may be minor and easily implemented, or they may be more \n\nsigni˛cant and require careful planning and monitoring. Implementation will require \n\nmobilization of ˛nancial and human resources, as well as ongoing, e˚ective partnerships \n\nwith agencies and other organizations that may be involved in, or a˚ected by, \n\nimplementation of the adaptation measures.\nIf the individuals who will be responsible for and involved in implementing the \nadaptations have been engaged in the earlier stages of vulnerability assessment, they \n\nshould already know the reasons why adaptations are needed. If they have not had an \n\nopportunity to learn about climate change impacts or how and why speci˛c adaptations \n\nwere chosen, they will need to be brought up to speed, to facilitate their support and \n\nensure e˚ective implementation of the adaptations. Moser and Ekstrom (2010) have \n\nsummarized the barriers to implementation of adaptation options and some options for \n\novercoming them. \n', '6.3.2     The Practice \nMainstreaming adaptation into day-to-day operations requires integrating priority \nadaptations into ongoing planning and operational procedures. This can be accomplished \n\nby developing a mainstreaming plan for each priority adaptation. If appropriate, \n\nindividual plans can be combined into a comprehensive mainstreaming plan with \n\nstrategic, operational, and adaptive capacity components. \nWorksheet 6.3 (Implement \n\n[mainstream] recommended adaptations)\n provides a template to aid you in preparing \n\nyour mainstreaming plans. For each recommended adaptation, the follow actions are \n\nsuggested: \n   \nAssess the \njurisdiction\n within which the adaptation actions fall and the roles and \nresponsibilities of various agencies and individuals in implementation.\n   \nIdentify the \nactions\n required to implement the adaptation (e.g., changes in planning, \nprocedures, policies, regulations, legislation, investments, protocols, guidelines, \ntraining, and operational methods).\n   \nIdentify opportunities to mainstream\n the adaptation into regular business \nprocesses.\n   \nIdentify roles and responsibilities\n (i.e., the speci˛c person or department that will \nlead implementation and other individuals or departments that should be involved). \n\nSet deadlines for implementation progress.\n   \nAssess the \ninternal support\n required for implementation to proceed (e.g., \noperational sta˚, specialists, senior management, political leaders). \n   \nAssess the \nexternal support\n required for implementation to proceed (e.g., \ninvolvement or buy-in from other organizations).\n   \nIdentify the \nhuman resources\n required for implementation to proceed and assess \nwhether these resources are available or if they must be secured.\n   \nAssess \ninformation and/or training needs\n that may be required to implement the \nadaptation.   \nIdentify the \n˜nancial resources\n required for implementation to proceed and assess \nwhether these resources are available or if they must be secured. \n   \nDescribe what successful implementation would look like (e.g., all planning and \n\noperations sta˚ are knowledgeable about climate change impacts and adaptation; \n\nsilvicultural operations re˜ect changes in precipitation). \n   \nIdentify the \noverall schedule\n, the timing of speci˜c events\n, and the milestones\n associated with implementation.\n   \nDetermine if there is a need to \ncommunicate\n with decision makers, other sta˚, or \n\ninterested parties about the adaptation and its potential implications.\n   \nDetermine if there is an\n existing monitoring or tracking plan\n into which this \n\nadaptation should be incorporated. \n   \nConsider whether the adaptation can help to achieve other non-SFM objectives or \n\ngoals. \nClimate Change and Sustainable Forest Managment in Canada:  \n 66  Chapter 6\n A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making\n', 'Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Management in Canada:\n A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making\n Chapter 6  \n67Ideally, the adaptations will be mainstreamed into regular business processes and \nincluded in regular business reviews and improvements over time. If not, consider \n\ncreating a separate implementation plan and a team to monitor implementation and \n\ne˚ectiveness. The ˛rst tasks of the implementation team should be to review and ˛nalize \n\nthe implementation plan and to secure the necessary internal and external support from \n\nkey agencies.\nA basic approach\nIntegrate the adaptations into your existing strategic plans (e.g., strategic forest \nmanagement plan), operational plans (e.g., annual work plan), and day-to-day decisions. \n\nAdd the priority adaptations when you update each plan, or undertake a review to identify \n\nwhether existing plans should be updated immediately. \nA comprehensive \n\napproach\nE˚ective communications and good working relationships will be extremely important to \n\nsuccessful implementation of adaptations. In addition, implementation provides a great \n\nopportunity to work cooperatively and collaboratively with land management partners and \n\nother interested parties. Work with these stakeholders to secure needed resources, identify \n\nbusiness process requirements, prioritize activities, agree on responsibilities, and identify \n\nfeasible milestones. Working together to mainstream adaptations will help to create buy-in \n\nand should result in adaptations that are realistic and achievable.\nOperational \n\nconsiderations  \nTo support buy-in and e˚ective implementation, it will be essential to share the reasons for \n\nthe adaptations with anyone who will be involved in implementing them (e.g., planners, \n\ngovernment approvals sta˚, operations personnel, contactors, and forest workers). \n\nRemember that this will take time and resources. \nStrategic considerations  \nEnsure that you have done everything you can to garner support from the various \n\nindividuals and organizations that may be a˚ected by the adaptation, both internal \n\npersonnel (such as senior managers) and external interests (such as communities and \n\nneighboring land users).\n6.4 Evaluate Adaptation Performance\n6.4.1     The Theory\nInsights and recommendations about management policies and practices gained \nby working through the worksheets in this guidebook represent a starting point for \n\nvulnerability assessment and adaptation. Con˛dence in the feasibility and e˚ectiveness \n\nof some adaptations and in projections for future climate change may be low, so it is \n\nessential that individual adaptations and the entire SFM system be closely monitored \n\nand re˛ned once recommendations for adaptation options have been made (see \n\nWilliamson and Edwards 2014). As well, regardless of the acceptability and feasibility \n\nof the recommended adaptation actions, some vulnerability is likely to remain after \n\nimplementation. Therefore, monitoring is an essential part of the vulnerability and \n\nadaptation assessment framework. The aim of monitoring is to track whether adaptations \n\nhave been implemented, whether SFM objectives are being met under a changing \n\nclimate, and whether residual vulnerability necessitates re˛nement of objectives or \n\nactivities.\n', 'To be e˚ective, monitoring should be part of a systematic process in which information \ngained by monitoring is used to improve decisions, re˛ne practices, or change \n\nmanagement objectives (e.g., adaptive management or continuous improvement). \n\nThe monitoring results can help to identify areas where implementation is progressing \n\nand objectives are being met but also areas of concern. For each measure that raises \n\na concern, adjustments to current practices (e.g., changes to operational practices, \n\nre˛nements to plans, enhanced research) should be identi˛ed and implemented. If SFM \n\nis not being satisfactorily achieved, the manager, agency, or organization responsible \n\nfor forest management should determine a new course of action, such as modifying \n\nthe adaptation, modifying relevant SFM objectives, or acknowledging (and ideally \n\ndocumenting) that the residual vulnerability to SFM is acceptable and that no further \n\nchanges to current activities are needed (see the decision-analysis framework for \n\nadaptation to climate change, presented as Figure 4 in Williamson et al. [2012]). \nAll interested parties involved in or a˚ected by the management and adaptation activities \nbeing evaluated should be included in, or at least informed about, the monitoring and \n\nevaluation of SFM and implementation of adaptations.\nIn an adaptive management context, there is a number of reasons for establishing \na monitoring or tracking program, in addition to monitoring the performance of \n\nadaptations:   \nto determine whether the context of your management objectives and vulnerabilities \nhas changed    \nto assess if any of the underlying research is out of date\n   \nto track implementation progress\n   \nto communicate accomplishments through regular reporting\n   \nto support adaptive management\n   \nto highlight areas requiring management attention\n   \nto indicate where changes or revisions may be required to the adaptation plan.\n6.4.2     The Practice\nWhere adaptations are mainstreamed into existing planning and practices, such as SFM \n\nplans, existing monitoring approaches should be reviewed to ensure they account for \n\nthe adaptations. Additional monitoring should be considered to adequately track the \n\nsuccess of adaptations and catch any concerns early in the adaptation process. As well, \n\nit may be necessary to re˛ne existing indicators to integrate the new information from \n\nthis process. A recent report by Steenberg et al. (2013) provides guidance on adjusting \n\nCCFM SFM indicators to re˜ect climate change adaptation (see ﬁCase Study Œ Review of \n\nSFM indicators for climate changeﬂ). Williamson and Edwards (2014) have suggested that a \n\nnational conversation may be required to address the potential impacts of climate change \n\non the national CCFM criteria and indicators.\nIf existing planning and practices do not include monitoring and evaluation, the \nimplementation of climate change adaptations may create an opportunity to integrate \n\nthese important management phases into the organization™s day-to-day operations, \nClimate Change and Sustainable Forest Managment in Canada:  \n 68  Chapter 6\n A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making\n', 'Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Management in Canada:\n A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making\n Chapter 6  \n69Case Study Œ Review of SFM \nindicators for climate change\nSteenberg et al. (2013) have assessed the potential impacts of climate change on the \n\nexisting CCFM criteria and indicators and made recommendations for maintaining, \n\nadjusting, or removing individual indicators. They also made recommendations for new \n\nindicators.\nagain in support of mainstreaming. As a last resort, a separate monitoring and evaluation \nplan could be developed that outlines resource requirements, roles of contributing \n\norganizations, and individual responsibilities and milestones for monitoring SFM indicators \n\nand implementation of adaptation actions. \nA basic approach\nKeep it simple. Your list of indicators should be kept to a realistic, practical number. When \nformulating your monitoring plan, consider the human and ˛nancial resources that \n\nare available for monitoring, and prioritize the list of indicators to those that are most \n\nmeaningful for reporting on implementation progress and trends toward achieving SFM \n\nobjectives. \nA comprehensive \n\napproach\nIn the face of uncertainty, forest managers should take an approach that emphasizes ongoing \n\nlearning, whereby management adaptations are treated to some extent as ﬁexperiments,ﬂ and \n\nnew information collected through monitoring is evaluated to determine next steps. Adaptive \n\nmanagement recognizes the lack of knowledge about ecosystem function and climate \n\nchange and integrates continual learning. \nMonitoring and evaluation should go hand in hand. Monitoring alone is useless if the \ninformation it generates is not analyzed in a formal evaluation process. By quantitatively or \n\nqualitatively describing status and trends over time, indicators provide the basis for before-\n\nand-after analyses.\nOperational \n\nconsiderations  \nRegardless of how monitoring and evaluation are accomplishedŠby mainstreaming into \n\nexisting activities, by adding these important steps to ongoing activities, or by creating \n\nseparate implementation and monitoring/evaluation plansŠthe roles and responsibilities \n\nfor these tasks must be clear, with de˛ned reporting timelines. Including everyone who is \n\ninvolved in implementing adaptations in the monitoring and evaluation phase will expedite \n\nadaptation, promote continuous learning throughout partner organizations, and produce \n\nmore realistic re˛nements to adaptations when needed. \nStrategic considerations  \nMonitoring provides the information needed to improve plans and take timely corrective \n\naction. Success depends on a long-term commitment to integrate monitoring and \n\nevaluation into ongoing operations, both during implementation and over the lifespan \n\nof the adaptations. The selection of indicators for monitoring and the frequency of \n\nmonitoring may evolve over time. You might also consider coordinating indicators and their \n\nmeasurement with other organizations and undertaking appropriate research initiatives to \n\nmaximize the value of the information collected.\nUse Worksheet 6.4 (Evaluate adaptation performance)\n to describe how you plan to \nevaluate adaptation performance. \n', 'Chapter 6\n Completion Check-In\nHas the assessment team:\n   Developed a list of prioritized adaptation options?\n   \nDeveloped a list of recommended adaptation options for implementation?\n   \nIntegrated implementation planning into existing SFM processes, or created an \nimplementation plan outlining the human resources, ˛nancial resources, business \n\nprocesses, and partnerships required for successful implementation of your \n\nadaptation priorities?\n   Outlined a plan for continuous evaluation of the implementation of adaptation \nactions and for continuous monitoring of the SFM system?\n6.5 Literature Cited\nLim, B.; Spanger Siegfried, E., editors. 2005.

Description of the managed forest\nDescribe the spatial extent of the managed forest area selected for the vulnerability \n\nassessment. Provide details about factors relevant to forest management (e.g., types and \n\ndistribution of ecosystems, species, age classes, timber volumes, disturbances), as well as \n\nthe timber and nontimber bene˛ts and values derived from the forest (e.g., wood values, \n\nrecreational use, wildlife-related bene˛ts, intrinsic forest values).\nClimate Change and Sustainable Forest Managment in Canada:  \n 76  Chapter 7\n A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making\n', 'Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Management in Canada:\n A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making\n Chapter 7  \n77Description of the managed forest \nTable 1.5.

De˛ning the planning timeframes (e.g., detailed operations plans, timber supply \n\nplan horizons, SFM plans) at this stage of the process can help to determine the relevant \n\ntimeframe for the assessment.\nClimate Change and Sustainable Forest Managment in Canada:  \n 78  Chapter 7\n A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making\n', 'Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Management in Canada:\n A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making\n Chapter 7  \n791.2-C.     \n Human elements of the SFM system (actors and their \ndecision-making scope)\nList the organizations and individuals involved in planning and operations in your SFM \nsystem and describe the role of each individual (e.g., prepares plans, approves plans, \n\nprovides advice, supervises operations, monitors operations).  \nDecisions about managing forest resources will a˚ect a wide range of other values that \nsociety derives from the forest. Therefore, you may also want to consider who will be \n\na˚ected by these decisions, so you can invite them to participate in the assessment or \n\nkeep them informed of progress and outcomes. Having other interested parties (e.g., \n\nstakeholders) involved or kept informed from the outset can be of assistance if you wish to \n\ntry new SFM options.\nThe human elements of an SFM system may include (but are not limited to) the following: \n\n   \nagencies involved in overall land management or organizations that partner in the \nmanagement of the area\n   \nagencies involved in reviewing or approving plans for compliance and enforcement\n   \norganizations holding land-use tenures \n   \nany organization that can a˚ect decisions for the area\n   \nany organization or individuals that may be a˚ected by decisions for the area\nTable 1.7.

SFM criteria and objectives \nA primary aspect of structured decision making is de˛ning what you are trying to achieve \nby actively managing a system. In other words, what are the management objectives?\nThis worksheet is critical to the vulnerability assessment, as \nthe objectives listed here are referenced throughout the rest \n\nof the guidebook (especially Worksheet 4.1 and beyond). The \ncentral focus of the CCFM vulnerability assessment approach \nis to determine what impacts climate change may have on \n\nyour ability to achieve your management objectives. Also, \n\nadaptation options de˚ned later in the assessment process \nshould be linked to these objectives.\nThis guidebook focuses on the national SFM criteria, as de˛ned by the CCFM (2003, 2006) \nand listed below (see Appendix 3 for a complete list of indicators for each CCFM criterion).  \n\nThe system of interest that you have de˛ned may use the same structure, or it may have \n\ndi˚erent categories of criteria. List the management goals or objectives in your area, using \n\nwhatever structure is relevant for your system.\nCriterion 1. \n Biological diversity: \nMaintaining biological diversity so that organisms and \necosystems can respond and adapt to environmental change.\nCriterion 2. \n Ecosystem condition and productivity: \nEnsuring that forest ecosystems \n\ncan cope with and recover from natural and human disturbances and \n\nmaintain their ecological functions and processes.\nCriterion 3. \n Soil and water: \nModifying management techniques to minimize disturbance, \nerosion, and compaction.\nCriterion 4. \n Role in global ecological cycles\n (speci˛cally forest carbon management): \nEnsuring that forests are able to depend on and contribute to self-regulating \n\nprocesses responsible for carbon, water, nitrogen, and other life-sustaining \n\nelements.\nCriterion 5. \n Economic and social bene˜ts: \nProviding a broad range of forest goods and \n\nservices over the long term, o˚ering signi˛cant economic and social bene˛ts.\nCriterion 6. \n Society™s responsibility: \nRe˜ecting social values in forest operations and \n\nrecognizing that many rural communities depend on the forest for their \n\neconomic, social, and cultural well-being.\nNote:\n It may also be useful to reference any documentation on forest management \n\nplanning, practices, procedures, and indicators that you use to achieve and track these \n\nmanagement objectives. The assessment team may also want to explore any assumptions \n\nmade in relation to the objectives (e.g., an objective that states ﬁmanagement practices \n\nwill maintain forest cover strata as it exists todayﬂ likely assumes that climate will remain \n\nconstant). Understanding these assumptions can aid during the vulnerability assessment \n\nsteps in section 7.4.\nClimate Change and Sustainable Forest Managment in Canada:  \n 80  Chapter 7\n A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making\n', 'Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Management in Canada:\n A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making\n Chapter 7  \n81Table 1.8.

Key nonclimatic factors currently a˚ecting your SFM system\nList any factors that are currently a˚ecting your ability to achieve your SFM objectives (e.g., \nmarkets, shortage of workers, changes in land use, lack of data). These factors may a˚ect \n\nyour SFM system into the future and will need to be considered, along with any climate \n\nchange impacts, during the vulnerability assessment. Identifying these factors now will \n\nhelp when developing future scenarios later in the process (section 7.3).\nTable 1.9.

Remember that the process is intended to be iterative and adaptive; you can \n\nalways get started and come back to certain steps once new information or knowledge is \n\ngained.\nIf most of the responses in Table 1.11 are ﬁno,ﬂ then you probably need to do some \nadditional preplanning to overcome some of the shortfalls. The following suggestions may \n\nhelp:   \nIf human, ˛nancial, and/or information resources are limited or unavailable, you might \nlook to other initiatives, programs, databases, research projects, etc., for support. \n\nPartnering with a local college or university to compile information or do analyses \n\nmay be e˚ective. \n   \nReview the worksheets for chapter 1 with colleagues and managers to boost their \n\nunderstanding of potential impacts, and identify a champion if one is needed.\n   \nIf interested groups or individuals are unlikely to support adaptation actions, consider \n\nhaving a respected champion speak to them, or review the worksheets for chapter 1 \n\nwith them.   \nConsider assessing a smaller geographic area or a selection of SFM activities for a \n\nbetter match with available expertise and resources.\n1.3-D.     Re˜ne the scope of the assessment \nGetting started with an assessment, even if it has not been perfectly de˛ned, is often more \n\nbene˛cial than waiting until all the required resources can be gathered and the timing is \n\nﬁperfect.ﬂ That said, starting a complex task such as vulnerability assessment without a clear \n\nscope and without knowing that the assessment is feasible and achievable can lead to \n\nfailure (see Moser and Ekstrom 2010).\nAt this stage, you should have a clear and de˛ned statement of purpose for the \nvulnerability assessment, along with its expected outcomes. You will also have de˛ned the \n\nscope in terms of both geography and participants. Now is a good time to examine the \n\ngoals and scope and ensure you have the ability to achieve them. If not, you may want to \n\nrede˛ne the statement of purpose, narrow the scope, or ˛nd additional resources before \n\nproceeding.\nClimate Change and Sustainable Forest Managment in Canada:  \n 86  Chapter 7\n A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making\n', 'Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Management in Canada:\n A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making\n Chapter 7  \n877.2 Worksheets for Chapter 2\nThe following worksheets provide guidance on describing and documenting how climate \nhas shaped current forest conditions and management practices in your SFM area.

More intricate \n\nanalysis of adaptive capacity can also be pursued but may require the participation of \n\nspecialists. Williamson and Isaac (2013) provided a detailed overview of approaches for \n\nassessing adaptive capacity. \nThe capacity to adapt is the ability of individuals, organizations, or management systems \nto adjust to change, to take actions to moderate potential damages, to take advantage \n\nof opportunities, or to cope with the consequences of change. The means to adapt are \n\na function of the assets and resources that contribute to adaptability (e.g., knowledge \n\ncapital, human capital, social capital) and the factors that a˚ect the ability to e˚ectively \n\nmobilize or utilize adaptive capacity resources (e.g., awareness and perceptions of \n\nrisk). Investment in adaptive capacity and the process of mobilizing adaptive capacity \n\nresources are also in˜uenced by institutions. Sometimes, existing institutions pose \n\nbarriers to adaptation (thereby reducing adaptive capacity). Thus, the ability to adapt \n\nmay also depend on the ability to adjust, modify, or transform institutions. The ease with \n\nwhich institutions can be modi˛ed or transformed is in turn a˚ected by the system of \n\ngovernance. The following are some of the key factors that contribute to the adaptive \n\ncapacity of SFM organizations or systems: awareness and risk perceptions, knowledge \n\ncapital, human capital, social capital (partnerships and networks), institutions, and resource \n\ngovernance. Questions related to each of these categories are presented in the Tables  \n\n4.2.1 Œ 4.2.6.It should be noted that the capacity to adapt to climate change is not the same as a \ngeneral capacity to adapt, although these concepts are related. SFM organizations and \n\nsystems with a certain general capacity to adapt may in fact have a lower capacity to \n\nadapt to climate change. For example, a particular SFM organization or system might have \n\nsigni˛cant human capital but lower human capital relevant to climate change impacts \n\nand adaptation. For the purposes of this assessment, both general adaptive capacity and \n\nadaptive capacity speci˛c to climate change are of interest.\nWhat is being assessed?\n The ˛rst step in assessing adaptive capacity is to identify \nand describe the organization or system that is being assessed. The adaptive capacity \n\nassessment should align as closely as possible with the organization or system de˛ned in \n\nsection 7.1, above. \n104  Chapter 7\n A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making\n', 'Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Management in Canada:\n A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making\n Chapter 7  \n105How should the assessment be completed?\n The goal of this step is to assess the \nadaptive capacity or adaptability of the SFM organization or system, not to evaluate \n\nspeci˛c adaptations. Nonetheless, it may be helpful to think of adaptive capacity in \n\nterms of what would be needed to implement potential adaptations. For example, \n\nimplementing a potential adaptation may require research, budget reallocation, increased \n\nfunding, knowledge exchange, education, more knowledgeable sta˚, stronger networks, \n\nor changes in rules and policies. The question of adaptability pertains to the degree to \n\nwhich the resources that enable adaptation are available, the degree to which institutions \n\nare designed to permit adaptation where it is justi˛ed, and the ˜exibility of governance to \n\nallow for changes in institutions where they are needed and justi˛ed.  \nTables 4.2.1 Œ 4.2.6 present a series of questions to guide you through an assessment of \nthe adaptive capacity of your SFM system of interest. Many of the questions ask you to \n\nrank your response (e.g., high, medium, or low) and signi˛cant space is provided to record \n\ndetails of why a certain rank was chosen. It is likely members of the assessment team may \n\nhave di˚ering opinions on certain questions. It would be useful to record any discussions \n\nhad on each question or di˚erence of opinions presented within the assessment team.     \n4.2.1      Awareness and understanding of climate change and \nperceptions of risk related to climate change\nAwareness and understanding of the potential e˚ects of climate change and perceptions \nof risk by political leaders, senior policy makers, forest management practitioners, SFM \n\nstakeholders, and the general public will signi˛cantly in˜uence preparedness and \n\nwillingness to implement adaptation measures at various levels.

Institutions can be formal (e.g., laws and policies) or \n\ninformal (e.g., norms and customs). \nSuccessful adaptation (i.e., adaptation that is rational, e˚ective, and justi˛ed) requires \nthat institutions allow for consideration of the current and potential future impacts of \n\nclimate change on forests and on human values associated with forests. That is to say, \n\ninstitutions that e˚ectively account for climate change provide the motivation, incentives, \n\nand authority for rational adaptation, along with disincentives or sanctions for failure to \n\nadapt (in cases where adaptation is warranted) or for maladaptation (i.e., inappropriate \n\nor unjusti˛ed adaptation). Institutions represent a key component of adaptive capacity, \n\nbecause those that fail to account for climate change will likely act as barriers to rational \n\nadaptation. One of the major challenges to forestry institutions is to account for the increased levels \nof complexity and uncertainty associated with forest management policy, planning, and \n\ndecision making under a changing climate. Institutional characteristics that are typically \n\nfavoured by decision makers and stakeholders are lack of ambiguity, predictability, fairness, \n\ne˝ciency, stability, and consistency. However, under a changing climate, the following \n\ncharacteristics of forestry institutions are desirable: they explicitly recognize the potential \n\nimpacts of climate change; they are forward-looking, while accounting for the signi˛cant \n\nuncertainties of future forest conditions and forest values under a changing climate; they \n\nare ˜exible; they are responsive; they accommodate or incorporate a diverse range of \n\nmanagement options and forest conditions; they enable or permit adaptation to local \n\nimpacts; they permit or enable, to some degree, an adaptive management approach; and \n\nthey provide appropriate incentives for building adaptability or adaptive capacity.      \nThe in˜uence of institutions on the adaptive capacity of SFM systems can be assessed \nin various ways. The table below presents a number of questions related to general \n\ncharacteristics of forest management institutions, followed by an assessment of speci˛c \n\nclimate change adaptability considerations related to SFM policy, assessment and \n\nmonitoring, forest management planning, and forest management practices (e.g., \n\nreforestation, harvesting).\nClimate Change and Sustainable Forest Managment in Canada:  \n 110   Chapter 7\n A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making\n', 'Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Management in Canada:\n A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making\n Chapter 7  \n111Table 4.2.5.

Given the preponderance of provincially owned forest land in Canada, \n\nforest resource governance is largely the responsibility of provincial forest management \n\nagencies. Resource governance regimes in Canada are continuously evolving and \n\nadapting to new ecological, economic, cultural and social conditions. Modifying \n\ninstitutions in response to change is not a novel concept. However, climate change \n\no˚ers a new and somewhat unprecedented driver of change. It is not something that \n\nresource governance regimes have necessarily experienced in the past or for which \n\nthey have precedents. The relative capacity of resource governance systems to make \n\nnecessary changes to institutions to properly adapt to climate change, and the ease with \n\nwhich they do so, will vary from situation to situation. Thus, this section of the adaptive \n\ncapacity assessment considers the ability of resource governance regimes to adapt their \n\ninstitutions in anticipation of climate change, considering both the mechanisms and the \n\nchallenges of adapting institutions. A self-assessment approach is proposed.  \nTable 4.2.5.

Glossary\nAdaptation\n ﬁAdjustment in natural or human systems in response to actual or expected climatic \nstimuli or their e˚ects, which moderates harm or exploits bene˛cial opportunitiesﬂ (Parry \n\net al. 2007).\nAdaptation options\nPotential actions or activities to address or reduce the vulnerabilities identi˛ed in a \n\nvulnerability assessment.\nAdaptation recommendations\nA subset of adaptation options, consisting of those options that will bene˛t sustainable \n\nforest management objectives and for which implementation is acceptable and feasible.\nAdaptive capacity\nﬁThe ability of a system to adjust to climate change (including climate variability and \n\nextremes) to moderate potential damages, to take advantage of opportunities, or to cope \n\nwith the consequencesﬂ (Parry et al. 2007). In this report, adaptive capacity refers to the \n\nhuman (as opposed to the biological) components of the sustainable forest management \n\nsystem.\nAdaptive capacity assessment\nAssessment of (1) the human and institutional resources and capacities (for example, \n\nhuman capital, social capital) available to identify adaptation requirements and to \n\nimplement adaptation actions; (2) the structural attributes, properties, and characteristics \n\nthat a˚ect the ability of a system to adapt (for example, ˜exibility, rigidity, diversity, \n\nliquidity, substitutability); and (3) the factors that impair optimal choices related to \n\nadaptation and adaptive capacity requirements (for example, ine˝cient institutions, \n\ncritical knowledge gaps, lack of awareness, biased perceptions of risk).\nAdaptive management\nﬁA systematic process for continually improving management policies and practices by \n\nlearning from the outcomes of previously employed policies and practicesﬂ (MEA 2005).  \nClimate\nﬁClimate in a narrow sense is usually de˛ned as the ‚average weather™, or more rigorously, \n\nas the statistical description in terms of the mean and variability of relevant quantities over \n\na period of time ranging from months to thousands or millions of years. These quantities \n\nare most often surface variables such as temperature, precipitation, and wind. Climate \nClimate Change and Sustainable Forest Managment in Canada:  \n 136  Appendixes\n A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making\n', 'Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Management in Canada:\n A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making\n Appendixes  \n137in a wider sense is the state, including a statistical description, of the climate system. The \nclassical period of time is 30 years, as de˛ned by the World Meteorological Organization \n\n(WMO)ﬂ (Parry et al. 2007).\nClimate change\nﬁClimate change refers to any change in climate over time, whether due to natural \n\nvariability or as a result of human activity. This usage di˚ers from that in the United Nations \n\nFramework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which de˛nes ‚climate change™ as: \n\n‚a change of climate which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters \n\nthe composition of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate \n\nvariability observed over comparable time periods™ﬂ (Parry et al. 2007).\nClimate change impacts\nﬁThe e˚ects of climate change on natural and human systems. Depending on the \n\nconsideration of adaptation, one can distinguish between potential impacts and residual \n\nimpacts.ﬂ Potential impacts are ﬁall impacts that may occur given a projected change in \n\nclimate, without considering adaptation.ﬂ Residual impacts are ﬁthe impacts of climate \n\nchange that would occur after adaptationﬂ (Parry et al. 2007). In vulnerability assessment, \n\nimpacts are the result of exposure to climate change and the sensitivity of the sustainable \n\nforest management system to a particular level of exposure.\nClimate variability\nﬁVariations in the mean state and other statistics (such as standard deviations, the \n\noccurrence of extremes, etc.) of the climate on all temporal and spatial scales beyond \n\nthat of individual weather events. The term is often used to denote deviations of climatic \n\nstatistics over a given period of time (e.g. a month, season or year) from the long-term \n\nstatistics relating to the corresponding calendar period. In this sense, climate variability is \n\nmeasured by those deviations, which are usually termed anomalies. Variability may be due \n\nto natural internal processes within the climate system (internal variability), or to variations \n\nin natural or anthropogenic external forcing (external variability)ﬂ (WMO n.d.).\nDriver\nAny natural or human-induced factor that directly or indirectly causes a change in a \n\nsystem, such as an ecosystem, managed forest, or human community (MEA 2005). \n\nExamples include changes in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases driving \n\nchanges in planetary mean temperature or changes in societal values driving changes in \n\nforest use.\nEcosystem\nﬁThe interactive system formed from all living organisms and their abiotic (physical and \n\nchemical) environment within a given area. Ecosystems cover a hierarchy of spatial \n\nscales and can comprise the entire globe, biomes at the continental scale or small, well-\n\ncircumscribed systems such as a small pondﬂ (Parry et al. 2007).\n', 'Ecosystem services\nﬁEcological services or functions having monetary or non-monetary value to individuals \nor society at large. There are (i) supporting services such as productivity or biodiversity \n\nmaintenance, (ii) provisioning services such as good, ˛bre, or ˛sh, (iii) regulating services \n\nsuch as climate regulation or carbon sequestration, and (iv) cultural services such as \n\ntourism or spiritual and aesthetic appreciationﬂ (Parry et al. 2007).\nEcozone\nﬁA broad, ecologically distinctive area delineated at a subcontinental level and de˛ned by \n\nits interaction of human, vegetative, wildlife, climatic, geologic, and physiographic factors. \n\nCanada™s ecological land classi˛cation framework comprises 15 terrestrial ecozones; these \n\nare subdivided into 53 ecoprovinces, the ecoprovinces into 194 ecoregions, and the \n\necoregions into 1020 ecodistrictsﬂ (CCFM 2006).\nExposure\nThe degree of climate change imposed upon a particular unit of analysis. Exposure may be \n\nrepresented as long-term changes in climate conditions, as well as by changes in climate \n\nvariability, including the magnitude and frequency of extreme events (McCarthy et al. \n\n2001). Forest impact scenarios\nA range of possible future forest conditions that could result under a given climate \n\nscenario. Forest impact scenarios include descriptions of changes in (1) processes such \n\nas physiological processes, phenological processes, and regeneration; (2) the frequency \n\nand intensity of biotic disturbances, such as insect outbreaks and diseases, and abiotic \n\ndisturbances, such as severe weather, drought, and wild˛re; (3) ecosystem health and \n\nproductivity; (4) forest inventory; and (5) forest composition and age-class over the \n\nlandscape.\nMainstreaming adaptation\nInclusion of climate change considerations in day-to-day decision making and \n\nmanagement on a continuous and ongoing basis.\nResilience\nﬁThe ability of a social or ecological system to absorb disturbances while retaining the \n\nsame basic structure and ways of functioning, the capacity for self-organisation, and the \n\ncapacity to adapt to stress and changeﬂ (Parry et al. 2007).\nScenarios\nﬁA plausible and often simpli˛ed description of how the future may develop, based \n\non a coherent and internally consistent set of assumptions about driving forces and \nClimate Change and Sustainable Forest Managment in Canada:  \n 138  Appendixes\n A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making\n', 'Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Management in Canada:\n A Guidebook for Assessing Vulnerability and Mainstreaming Adaptation into Decision Making\n Appendixes  \n139key relationships. Scenarios may be derived from projections, but are often based on \nadditional information from other sources, sometimes combined within a ‚narrative \n\nstoryline™ﬂ (Parry et al. 2007). Scenarios are not predictions, and they typically do not \n\ninclude prediction errors or likelihoods.\nSensitivity\nﬁThe degree to which a system is a˚ected, either adversely or bene˛cially, by climate \n\nvariability or change. The e˚ect may be direct (e.g., a change in crop yield in response to a \n\nchange in the mean, range or variability of temperature) or indirect (e.g., damages caused \n\nby an increase in the frequency of coastal ˜ooding due to sea-level rise)ﬂ (Parry et al. 2007).\nSensitivity assessment\nAssessment of the sensitivity or magnitude of a system™s potential response to a particular \n\nrate and magnitude of change in local climate (including change in mean values and \n\nchanges in variability and extremes). Sensitivity can be reduced or modi˛ed by adaptation.\nSustainable forest management (SFM)\n ﬁManagement that maintains and enhances the long-term health of forest ecosystems \n\nfor the bene˛t of all living things while providing environmental, economic, social, and \n\ncultural opportunities for present and future generationsﬂ (CCFM 2008). According to the \n\nCanadian Council of Forest Ministers, the criteria for de˛ning and monitoring sustainable \n\nforest management in Canada are biodiversity, ecosystem condition and productivity, soil \n\nand water, role of the forests in global ecological cycles, economic and social bene˛ts, and \n\nsociety™s responsibility.\nSustainable forest management system\nA coupled humanŒenvironmental system that obtains goods and services from forests \n\nand works toward the management of forests in a manner consistent with sustainable \n\nforest management (SFM) principles and objectives. SFM systems vary with spatial, \n\noperational, and organizational contexts. An SFM system can exist at any scale, including \n\nprovincial forests, community forests, protected areas, industrial lease areas, and small \n\nprivate woodlots.\nVulnerability\nﬁThe degree to which a system is susceptible to, and unable to cope with, adverse e˚ects \n\nof climate change, including climate variability and extremes. Vulnerability is a function of \n\nthe character, magnitude, and rate of climate change and variation to which a system is \n\nexposed, its sensitivity, and its adaptive capacityﬂ (Parry et al. 2007).\n', 'Literature Cited\n[CCFM] Canadian Council of Forest Ministers. 2006.
