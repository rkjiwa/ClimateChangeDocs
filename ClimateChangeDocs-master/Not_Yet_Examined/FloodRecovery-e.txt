At the federal, provincial and municipal levels, \n\nplanning is the key to emergency preparedness. A well established and tested \n\nemergency plan helps to ensure a prompt and co-ordinated response by \n\nresponsible agencies in a time of crisis. NB EMO also co-ordinates provincial \n\nresponse operations during emergencies and administers the disaster \n\n˜nancial assistance program.\nFlood Recovery Œ Everything you need to know\nYour property\nAs the owner of the a˚ected property it is your responsibility to ensure that it \n\nis a safe and healthy environment for you and those who occupy it. You must \n\ntherefore take appropriate steps to ensure that clean up and recovery begins \n\nas soon as possible and not to wait for Government Assistance.\nAbout your House Œ A Homeowner™s Checklist\nAfter a ˛ood, it is important to restore your home to good order as soon as \n\npossible to protect your health and prevent further damage to property and \n\nbelongings. Whether you do the work yourself or hire a contractor, this handy \n\nchecklist will help you organize the clean up. Immediate action is important. \n\nYour house and furnishings are less likely to grow mould if contents are dried \n\nwithin 48 hours.\nBefore you begin\nPut your own safety ˜rst. Avoid electrical shock. If you are \nexperiencing ˛ooding and need to be disconnected or reconnected, \ncall NB Power at 1-800-663-6272.\nRecord details of damage, with photos or video if possible.

Detailed information is available \n\nonline from the \nNB Department of Health\n www.gnb.ca/healt\nhBe prepared to make di˝cult decisions about what to keep and what \nto throw out. Make sure the building is structurally safe. Look for \nbuckled walls or ˛oors. Watch for holes in the ˛oor, broken glass and \n\nother potentially dangerous debris. If in doubt, contact a professional.\nProtect Yourself When Cleaning Your Home\nFor personal protection during clean-up, wear rubber gloves and other \nprotective clothing. Avoid direct skin contact with contaminated material. \n\nPractice good personal hygiene (i.e. wash hands before eating or smoking) \n\nand change outer clothing before entering a ﬁcleanﬂ residence.\nHeating\n\nDo not heat your home to more than four degrees Celsius (about 40 degrees \nFahrenheit) until all water is removed.\nIf you use pumps or heaters powered by gasoline, kerosene or propane, buy \nand install a carbon monoxide sensor. Combustion devices can produce \n\nlarge amounts of lethal carbon monoxide when they are not tuned-up or are \n\nimproperly ventilated.\nMould and Mildew\n\nTo avoid the health hazards of mildew and mould, water soaked walls and \ninsulation should be removed, and the space and studding allowed to dry \n\nthoroughly. Walls constructed of gyproc, plaster or wood will dry out in time \n\nbut insulation in these walls in no longer e˚ective. As insulation becomes \n\nwater soaked the weight causes it to settle and compact at the bottom, \n\nleaving a large portion of the wall no longer insulated. \nCaution:\n Obtain approval from assessors, insurance agents and other relevant \nagencies before discarding or destroying any furniture or equipment.\n', 'Flood recovery for your home or business\n3Food A˛ected by Flooding\nTo avoid the health hazards of food contamination, all perishable goods, \nvacuum-packed foods and any other foods a˚ected by ˛ooding should be \n\nthrown out. Undamaged commercially-canned food properly identi˜ed by \n\nlabels, containers which show no leaks, swelling or rusting at joints or edges \n\nshould be thoroughly washed and dried. Vacuum-packed foods pose a special \n\nhazard due to dried waste material inside crevices and covers. They should \n \nbe discarded.\nHome preserves, meats, ˜sh or dairy products should be discarded as unsafe \nif they have been a˚ected by ˛ood water. Frozen foods left in a freezer will \n\nstay frozen for a few days without electricity if the door is kept shut. These \n\nproducts can be refrozen if ice crystals are still present and the food has not \n\nbeen exposed to ˛ood waters. All perishable food left in a refrigerator more \n\nthan 24 hours without electricity should be discarded.\nCooking and eating utensils should be cleaned of all deposits, washed with \nhousehold detergent or soap and rinsed for at least two full minutes in a mixture \n\ncontaining 15 millilitres (one table spoon) of liquid bleach in 4.5 litres (one \n\ngallon) of water. Utensils used for infant feeding should be boiled before use.\nRefrigerators, Freezers, Stoves and Other Appliances\n\nAppliances (that have \nnot been partially and entirely immersed in ˛ood \nwater) and food contact surfaces should be cleaned as follows:\nEnsure electrical power is turned o˚.\nClean the unit thoroughly with a detergent solution, rinse with clean \nwater that has been previously boiled, and then wash with a solution \n\ncontaining one-half cup of bleach in nine litres (two gallons) of water.\n\nAllow to dry with door kept open.\nNote:\n Any appliance that has been partially or wholly immersed in water is no longer \n\ninsulated. It cannot be dried without removal. A quali˜ed service technician should be \ncontacted before the appliance is put into service\n or thrown out.\nHazardous Products\nHousehold hazardous products, such as pesticides, can also cause problems. \nContaminated items and surfaces should also be cleaned. Although small \n\namounts of household hazardous products or agricultural products can \n', 'Be prepared\n4be placed in plastic bags and discarded with domestic garbage, signi˜cant \nquantities should be handled di˚erently, under the advice of the Department \n\nof Environment.\nBasements and Rooms\n\nIt is important to use a good soap or detergent, ﬁelbow greaseﬂ, and lots of hot \nwater when cleaning.\nWalls, solid ˛oors, and ceilings should be thoroughly scrubbed with a good \ndetergent or soap and water. Avoid household bleach. Organic content \n\nand pH in ˛ood waters as well as contact time required for bleach to kill \n\nmicroorganisms may render bleach ine˚ective. For signi˜cant ˛ood or water \n\ndamage, you may consult with an air quality specialist or professional cleaner.\nWater and wastes can be removed by pumping, pails, shovels, etc. Wastes \nshould be buried at least 15 metres (50 feet) away from the source of any \n\nwater supply. Lime may be used to cover wastes before covering with soil. This \n\nadvice applies to all waste disposals in the following section. Oil or petroleum \n\nproducts are usually removed with Varsol or similar products.\nAfter cleaning, open doors and windows to air thoroughly and help the \ndrying process.\nOil Clean-up\n\nAn oil spill which occurs in a house could create a contamination problem \nthat can be di˝cult to correct. Peat moss can be used to remove ˛oating \n\noil. If only ˜nished basement walls have been a˚ected, the odour can be \n\neliminated by removing and discarding the wall covering, studding, insulation \n\nand any other permeable material. Caution should be taken in using electrical \n\nequipment during cleaning since the fumes could ignite and cause an explosion. \n\nDispersants should be avoided in cases where oil tanks have been ruptured.\nHousehold Furnishings\n\nSolid wood or metal furniture can be cleaned with a household detergent \nsolution, wiping clean and then wiping dry. Furniture should be left to dry \n\noutside before furniture polish may be applied where needed. Upholstered \n\nfurniture and mattresses a˚ected by ˛ooding should not be used.\n', 'Flood recovery for your home or business\n5Reminder:\n Anything that stays wet long enough will grow mould; mould can \nmake people sick. Dry everything quickly to avoid future health problems\n.Water Contamination\nPrivate water supplies a˚ected by ˛ooding should not be used until they have \nbeen disinfected and tested. Until tests indicate a safe water supply, \nwater for \n\ndrinking and personal use should be brought to a rolling boil for at least \n \n1 minute\n and then stored in clean covered containers. Communicate with \n\nyour local \nHealth Protection Branc\nh o˝ce for information on how to proceed \n\nto have your water tested. \nFor more information and useful links, visit the River Watch website:\n  www.gnb.ca/riverwatc\nhHow to chlorinate your well water\nIf you rely on a well for your water, you may have to chlorinate it from time to \n\ntime. Chlorination refers to the process of ˛ushing your well and water system \n\nwith a chlorine solution.\nThis process is usually applied in order to accomplish one of the following:\nDisinfecting to ﬁneutralizeﬂ coliform bacteria\nDisinfecting after making repairs to your well or following extended \nperiod of non-use\nTemporary elimination of hydrogen sulphide (or ﬁrotten eggﬂ) odours\nTemporary removal of iron and manganese build-up\nRemoval of bacteria that create slime\nRead all of the instructions before proceeding!\nBefore you begin the chlorination process, store enough water to \n1. meet your household needs for a minimum of 24 hours.\nNext, remove any ˜lter, water conditioners, or any type of water \n2. treatment system, or ˜nd a way to by-pass them during chlorination.\n\nUse the chart below to determine the amount of chlorine solution \n3. that is recommended for your water system. For dug wells use \napproximately 1 litre of chlorine solution for every 100 litres of water.\n', 'Be prepared\n6Note: \nThe chlorine solution is simply common unscented household bleach, \ncontaining 3-5% sodium hypochlorite.\nVolume of Chlorine Solution Chart\nVol. of Chlorine Solution (litres) per diameter of Well\nWell Depth (ft)\n4 inch5 inch6 inchless than 50123.550˜100\n247101˜150\n3.5710151˜200\n4.5913.5201˜250\n5.51117251˜300\n713.520.5301˜350\n81624351-40091827Pour the chlorine solution into your well. If your well head is buried, \n4. excavation is probably required. An alternative is to apply the \nchlorine solution through an air line, if there is one leading from the \n\nwell to your home.\nThere are two methods for using the air line: you can either insert the \nair line into the container of chlorine solution and pump your well \n\nuntil all the solution  is consumed, or simply pour the solution into \n\nthe air line (If you use either of these methods, ˛ush the air line out \n\nwith clean water after chlorinating your well).\nAttach a garden hose to an outside faucet and place the other end \n5. into the well. Turn on the outside faucet and allow the water to \ncirculate for approximately 1 hour.\nNote:\n If your well head is buried and you choose not to excavate, or \nthe garden hose \ncannot be connected to the air line, disregard this step.\n', 'Flood recovery for your home or business\n7Open each faucet in your water distribution system, (including \n6. inside and outside faucets, cold and hot water faucets, dishwashers, \ntoilets, baths and showers), one at a time, until the smell of chlorine is \n\napparent, then quickly shut them o˚. This will thoroughly chlorinate \n\nyour water distribution system. \nNote: \nDuring this procedure, chlorinated water that is permitted to enter your sewage \n\nsystem should be kept to a minimum, as an excess amount \nof chlorine may a˚ect the \nbiological activity of a septic tank system.\nDo not operate your water system for a minimum of 8 hours \n7. (overnight, for example) or longer if possible. A 24 hour period is \nrecommended, but may not always be practical.\nPlace the end of your garden hose in an outside location where the \n8. chlorinated water will not run into a natural waterway (such as a \nstream, brook, lake, etc.) or damage any desired vegetation (like your \n\nvegetable garden). Allow the water to ˛ow until a strong chlorine \n\nodour is no longer apparent (generally 2 to 3 hours). If you have a low \n\nyield well, be careful not to pump the well dry.\nNote: \nDuring this procedure, the water may have the colour of tea, but the colour will \n\nimprove after a short period of time. Aeration screens in faucets and the cold water \n\ninlet of washing machines may become plugged with sediment. For water systems \n\nequipped with jet pumps, there is also a possibility that the jet may become clogged \n\nwith sediment. It is important to keep this in mind, especially if the jet is located in the \n\nwell column, which may require excavation of the well head.\nTurn on each faucet in the house (one at a time), and run the water \n9. until the odour of chlorine is no longer present. It is recommended \n\nthat you do not drink the water during this ˛ushing period.\nOnce the ˛ushing process is complete you may resume normal use of \n10. your water, keeping in mind that it may be two to three days before \nthe chlorine odour and taste is completely gone.\n Note\n: If you chlorinated your well to address a coliform bacteria problem, you should \n\nhave your well water tested at an accredited lab before using it again. To do this, you \n\nwill need to collect a water sample about one week after you have chlorinated your \nsystem and have it analyzed immediately after collecting it (within 24 hours).\nIf the chlorination process results in a noticeable improvement in \n11. your water quality, but the problem redevelops after two to three \nweeks, repeat steps 1 to 9, using two to three times the amount of \n', 'Be prepared\n8chlorine solution recommended for your water system. In addition, \nyou should increase the period of time in which you do not operate \n\nyour water system (step 7) to a minimum of 24 hours.\nA ˝nal note\nDepending on the characteristics of your well water quality, it may be \nnecessary to chlorinate your well system more than once a year. Chlorination \n\nmay or may not improve your water quality, and in some cases, provides only \n\na temporary or short-term solution.\nThere are many household water treatment systems available that are \napproved by the National Sanitation Foundation (NSF). Look for a listing of \n\nretailers who carry these systems, in the yellow pages of the telephone book.\nQuestions?
