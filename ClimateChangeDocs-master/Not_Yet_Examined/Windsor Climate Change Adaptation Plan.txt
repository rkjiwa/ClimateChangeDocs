This can lead\n \nto more \nintense\n \nrainfall events, which \nWi\nndsor has already experienced directly\n \nincluding\n \nevents in \n2007 and \n2010 which caused severe flooding. In 2011, Windsor ex\nperienced the wettest year on record, \nmeasuring\n \n1,568\nmm of rain compa\nred to the average annual rainfall of 844mm. Increased temperature \nand intense rainfall events are two climate change impacts that have resulted in direct costs to Windsor \nresidents through basement flooding and heat related illness expenses.\n \nMunicipalitie\ns have a significant role to pla\ny in climate change adaptation as m\nany \nclimate change \ni\nmpacts will directly affect the services provided by the City of Windsor and our agencies\n. \nThis plan was \ndeveloped through \nconsultation with all City depa\nrtments and sel\nect City agencies.

Once these impacts were agreed upon, \na \nvulnerability\n \nand risk \nassessment was c\nompleted to further narrow down the potential impacts that pose the greatest risk\n \nto \nthe municipality as a whole\n.  \n \nThe focus of this adaptation plan is on the following five potential climate change impacts which \nwere \nrated as posing substantial risk and therefore may result in \nthe greatest impact on our municipal \noperations:\n \n1.\n \nIncrease in operating/maintenance demands to deal with climate extremes.\n \n2.\n \nIncreased chance of flooding to basements, roads and other infrastru\ncture\n \n3.\n \nIncrease in demand to all areas of Operations when responding to an increase in severe storms \n(during and after).\n \n4.\n \nIncrease in public health risks due to extreme heat.\n \n5.\n \nImplementation of d\nevelopment policies\n \nwhich were\n \ncreated in the absence of Climate\n \nChange \nconsiderations\n, which \nmay \nincrease our\n \nvulnerabilit\ny\n.\n \nThe list\n \nbelow summarizes the proposed short\n-\nterm adaptation actions\n \n\nresiliency to weather extremes.\n \nMany of these short\n-\nterm actions build on existing programs in \nrecognized areas of vulnerability.

of Windsor is already experiencing t\n\nmore intense summer storms than in previous years which have contributed to increased basement \nflooding.  The summer of 2010 was reported as the sec\n\nC degrees cooler \nthan the summer o\nf 2005, the hottest on record. Warming of the Great Lakes has contributed to major \necosystem impacts such as extensive algae growth, the invasion of non\n-\nnative species\n, pathogen and\n \nwater borne diseases and falling lake levels\ni\n. The West Nile virus and the\n \nincrease in Lyme disease in \nOntario are other consequences of climate change\nii\n.  \n \nThe climate will continue to change.  Although reducing greenhouse gas emissions is vital to limiting the \nrate and amount of change, it cannot prevent climate change from occ\nurring over at least \nt\nhe next \nseveral decades\niii\n.  \n \nAs a result, governments and communities must now consider how to adapt to the \nunavoidable effects of climate change.  \nTherefore, i\nn addition to\n \nthe City of Windsor\n\n \ninitiatives\n \nto \nmitigate climate change,\n \nit is becoming more evident that the City of Windsor needs to increase the \nadaptive capacity of the community.  \n \nICLEI Initiative\n \nICLEI \n\n \nLocal Governments for Sustainability\n \n(Management) Inc., referred to as ICLEI Canada\n \nis an \ninternational association o\nf local governments \nas well as\n \nnational and regional local government \norganizations that have made a commitment to sustainable development.  \nOn November 8\nth\n, 2010, \n\n(CR \n408/2010\n). \nThis program provided a straightforward methodology to adaptation planning which \nresulted in the creation of this Plan.

A well\n-\nadap\nted city is able to absorb the effects of climate change, such as extreme \nsummer heat or intense rain events, through the a\ndvancement of \nsustainable \npolicies, infrastructure \ninvestment, and public education.
