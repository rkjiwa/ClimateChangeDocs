Although all levels \n\nof government have important roles to play to advance \nadaptation, action at the local level is particularly important \nbecause that is where many of the impacts of climate \n\nchange will be felt most directly.\n1Local governments in Canada can manage the risks and \n\nopportunities presented by climate through a variety \n\nof practices, including adoption and enforcement of \nbylaws; collection of taxes and user fees; operation of \ntransportation, utilities and other public infrastructure; \n\nestablishment of subsidies, tax credits and other incentive \n\nprograms; administration of emergency management \n\nand response systems; and public outreach and \neducation˜initiatives.\nLand use planning is one of the most effective processes \nto facilitate local adaptation to climate change.\n3,4\n Historically, local governments have used land use planning \n\ntools Œ official plans, zoning, development permits and \nothers Œ to minimize risks to communities from floods, \nwildfires, landslides and other natural hazards.\n5 As the \nclimate changes, so will the frequency and magnitude of \n\nclimate-related hazards, posing a challenge for community \nplanners.

In addition, it provides information on \n\ndecision-support tools, tools that provide information and \nresources to help planners and local decision makers take \neffective adaptation action. \nA brief example of each tool and its use by a Canadian \ncommunity is given. Not every case discussed here was \nexplicitly motivated by a desire to adapt to climate change. \nHowever, the significance of the tool to adaptation \n\nplanning is clear in each case. An effort was made to select \n\nexamples from communities of varying sizes and from all \nregions of Canada. \n Although the examples are of broad utility, the design and \n\napplication of a particular planning tool can vary greatly \n\nfrom one jurisdiction to another, depending on provincial \nor territorial laws and other factors. We describe the \nprovincial and territorial roles in local adaptation planning \n\nin Appendix A. Readers interested in knowing how a \n\nparticular tool is applied in a specific community should \n\nconsult provincial, territorial and local laws.\nIt is important to keep in mind that land use planning is \nused to pursue many local policy objectives, including \n\nproviding affordable housing, stimulating job growth, \n\npreserving the character and heritage of a community, \nreducing greenhouse gas emissions, protecting biodiversity \nand enabling efficient transportation. A key challenge for \n\nplanners and local decision makers is how to incorporate \n\nand balance the need to prepare for climate change \nthrough adaptation with other local development \nobjectives. Another consideration is how to integrate \n\n(mainstream) consideration of changing climate into \n\nthe wide array of decisions made by local governments, \n\nfrom operating municipal services to capital spending, \nenforcement and inspection activities, collection of taxes, \nand administration of disaster response programs.\n', 'LAND USE PLANNING TOOLS \n| 3 LAND USE PLANNING TOOLS\nADAPTATION EXAMPLES\nPAGE\n2.1 Official plans\nIqaluit™s General Plan\n4Elkford™s Official Community Plan \n52.2 Local plans on special matters\nStratford™s Climate Change Adaptation Plan\n6Edmonton™s Urban Forest Management Plan\n7imagineCALGARY\n72.3 Zoning\nBeaubassin-est™s sea level rise protection zone\n8RosemontŒLa Petite-Patrie™s zoning bylaw to reduce the \n urban heat island effect \n92.4 \n Land subdivision and \n development controls\nToronto™s Green Standard\n10Halifax Regional Municipality development agreements\n112.5 Covenants and easements\nIsland Trust™s NAPTEP Covenant\n12Kamloops wildland-urban interface covenant\n132.6 Design guidelines\nRegina™s \nXeriscape Workbook\n14\nToronto™s Draft Design Guidelines for ﬁGreeningﬂ Surface Parking Lots\n152.7 \n Environmental review of \n development projects\nSaint John waterfront redevelopment\n16Town of Ajax environmental review of \n land development and infrastructure projects\n17PHOTO COURTESY OF NARADA THOMAS\nThis section describes seven of the most prominent land \nuse planning tools in use across Canada and explains how \n\ncommunities can use them to more effectively adapt to \nclimate change. \nLand use planning refers to the processes and instruments \nemployed to manage the use of land and the physical \n\ndevelopment of a community for the common interest. \nA variety of statutory and other measures Œ bylaws, \n\nincentives, information and guidance, spending programs˜Œ \n\nmay be applied to control how land is used.

Provincial approval may be \n\nrequired as well. \nAlso entitled general, community or master plans, these \ndocuments identify the major social, economic and \n\nenvironmental challenges facing the community and \n\narticulate strategies to address them. Official plans are \n\nin force for a relatively long period (10 years or longer) \nwith updates required periodically (every five years in \nsome provinces). They may designate some areas of the \n\ncommunity as appropriate locations for new growth \nIqaluit™s General Plan\n8Iqaluit (population 6200), the capital of Nunavut, is one of the first Canadian communities to integrate climate \n\nchange adaptation into its General Plan. One of the five priority vision statements identifies Iqaluit as ﬁa community \n\nthat adapts to climate change.ﬂ The plan sets out two high-level objectives to realize this vision: (1) to study the \nimpacts of climate change on the community and (2) to adopt policies that recognize the long-term impacts of \nclimate change. The plan includes more detail on the climate change issues of concern to the community (for \n\nexample, increases in temperature and precipitation, permafrost thaw, decreases in sea ice, and accelerated coastal \n\nerosion) and priority adaptation actions related to municipal infrastructure.\nPHOTO COURTESY OF MICHELE BERTOL\nwhile others are to be preserved or revitalised. Official \n\nplans serve as guiding documents for subsequent local \n\npolicies, programs and bylaws (such as zoning codes and \nsubdivision˜controls).\nClimate change adaptation can be incorporated directly \ninto a municipality™s official plan, either in a dedicated \n\nsection or embedded throughout the document. Such \ntexts normally detail local climate change risks and \nopportunities, an overarching adaptation vision and policy, \n\nas well as priority adaptation needs. Adaptation strategies \n\nand actions in official plans include mainstreaming \n\nadaptation into all or selected municipal operations, \nundertaking a comprehensive municipal risk assessment \nprocess to prioritize risks and opportunities, developing \n\na comprehensive municipal adaptation action plan, or \n\nobtaining critical information or technical data for making \neffective and appropriate adaptation decisions. \n', 'LAND USE PLANNING TOOLS \n| 5 Elkford™s Official Community Plan\n9,10\nThe District of Elkford is a small community (population 2500) in the Rocky Mountains of southeastern British \nColumbia. Historically, Elkford has dealt with several climate-related hazards, including flooding, drought and \n\nwildfires. A changing climate magnifies all these risks. In 2008, Elkford, with support of the Columbia Basin Trust, \na provincial crown corporation, developed a local adaptation strategy to assess the risks posed by climate change \nand identify corresponding adaptation actions. The Adaptation Strategy was developed concurrently with a revision \n\nto Elkford™s Official Community Plan (OCP), allowing the two to be fully integrated. Consideration of climate \n\nchange in all decision making is one of the OCP™s 11 guiding principles. Adaptation actions in the OCP include \n\na wildfire protection zone in which any development application must be accompanied by a fire hazard and risk \nassessment conducted by certified professionals before a permit is issued. The OCP also calls for the development \nof a community evacuation plan in the event of an extreme wildfire or flooding.\nPHOTO COURTESY OF DISTRICT OF ELKFORD\n', '6 | LAND USE PLANNING TOOLS\n2.2 LOCAL PLANS ON SPECIAL MATTERS \nIn addition to official plans, local governments adopt \nmany other kinds of plans. Those plans may focus on one \n\nfunction of local government (such as public transit or \nstorm water management), on a sector or issue of special \nsignificance to the community (such as the development \n\nof the arts or the needs of senior citizens) or on a \n\nneighbourhood with special planning needs.\n11 As with \nofficial plans, these local plans are often developed through \n\na formal planning process, including public consultation, \nand provide an assessment of conditions, a long-term vision \nand a set of goals and actions for the particular issue or \n\narea in question. \nA growing number of Canadian municipalities have \n\nadopted plans that specifically address the need to adapt to \n\nclimate change. Some communities have chosen to develop \n\nstand-alone adaptation plans. Those documents typically \noutline the climate change impacts of concern to the \ncommunity, the associated risks and opportunities, and the \n\ncommunity™s vision and proposed actions for dealing with \n\nthose changes. Many other communities have integrated \n\nconsideration of climate change adaptation into local plans \nthat address other issues. For example, a municipality may \nintegrate adaptation into its capital improvement plan for \n\nstorm water sewer systems.\nStratford™s Climate Change Adaptation Plan\n12The Town of Stratford (population 8046), a rapidly growing community in Prince Edward Island, is located on a \n\npeninsula just south of the provincial capital, Charlottetown. The main climate change issues of concern to the \n\ncommunity are coastal erosion, which already threatens several important heritage buildings and homes, sea level \nrise, storm surge and inland flooding. \nIn 2010, the Town, in partnership with the Canadian Institute of Planners and the Atlantic Planners Institute, \ncreated a long-term strategic plan to prepare Stratford for climate change. The process comprised four stages: \n(1) forming a core working group to establish overarching objectives, engage key stakeholders and conduct \n\nbackground research into local climate change impacts; (2) organizing public meetings to assess current and future \n\nvulnerabilities (following a presentation of the potential climate change impacts, a survey was distributed to all \n\nparticipants at the public meeting to gauge climate change-related opportunities and threats for the community); \n(3) conducting a risk assessment, building on results of the vulnerability assessment, to rank the most important \nclimate change impacts and identify priority areas for adaptation action; and (4) preparing a final adaptation plan \n\nthat included recommended adaptation actions by theme (for example, heritage properties, parks and recreation, \n\nprivate properties, emergency services, storm water infrastructure). Stratford has since integrated adaptation \nconsiderations into all new or updated community action plans, including its draft Official Plan, Strategic Plan and \nMaster Stormwater Management Plan.\nPHOTO COURTESY OF WINSTON MAUND\n', 'LAND USE PLANNING TOOLS \n| 7 Edmonton™s Urban Forest Management Plan\n13Edmonton (population 812 201), the capital \nof Alberta, is located along the North \n\nSaskatchewan River. The city™s urban tree \ncanopy is seriously threatened by drought, \ninsect infestations, disease, storms and climate \n\nchange. These threats spurred Edmonton to \n\ncreate the Urban Forest Management Plan \n\n(UFMP) to guide the management of the tree \ncanopy over a 10-year period. The UFMP \nincludes developing an inventory of the urban \n\nforest (completed 2009), a review of existing \n\nplanting strategies, a communication plan and \npotential tree planting partnerships. Many \nof these actions will increase resilience to \n\ndrought conditions, which may be exacerbated \n\nby climate change. For example, Edmonton™s \n\nForestry Unit is testing the use of different tree \nspecies, such as red maples, and alternative \ntree watering techniques. \nimagineCALGARY\n14\nCalgary (population 1 096 833) is situated in southern Alberta. The impact of climate change on water quality and \n\nquantity is of particular concern in the area. Local rivers are expected to experience decreased flow because of \n\ndecreased precipitation and reduced glacial coverage in the headwaters of the river basins.\n15 imagineCALGARY was \na community visioning and consultation process undertaken in 2005 to produce a 100-year roadmap for Calgary™s \n\ndevelopment. The process engaged more than 18 000 Calgarians representing businesses, community agencies, \nnon-profits and governments as well as the public. Calgary is one of the first communities in Canada to consider \nclimate change in its long-range planning. The City commissioned scoping reports to investigate how four major \n\ntrends might impact the city: demographic changes, resource scarcity, technology transformation and climate \n\nchange. Since publishing the imagineCALGARY plan in 2007, the City has implemented its vision and targets in \n\nsubsequent land use plans and strategies. Numerous local partner organizations in the private, non-profit and \npublic sectors have also committed to achieving the vision by changing their policies and practices.\nPHOTO COURTESY OF NICOLA JOHNSON\nPHOTO COURTESY OF THE CITY OF EDMONTON\n', '8 | LAND USE PLANNING TOOLS\n2.3 ZONING \nZoning is a regulatory tool widely used by municipalities \nto control land use within their borders.\n7,16,17,18\n It is a key \ntool for implementing the goals and objectives set out \n\nin a municipality™s official plan. Zoning bylaws divide \nthe entire community into zones. For each zone, only \ncertain land uses are permitted (for example, commercial, \n\nresidential, industrial). In addition to restrictions on the \n\nuse of the property, the zoning bylaws may impose \n\nrequirements on buildings, including maximum height, \nlot coverage and density, as well as building type and \nsetbacks. Those requirements are reflected in a zoning \n\nmap for the jurisdiction. Zoning restrictions usually apply \n\nonly˜prospectively.\n19Zoning codes can be used by municipalities to limit new \n\ndevelopment in hazard-prone areas (for instance in areas \n\nsubject to wildfires, landslides or coastal erosion) or to \nprescribe building standards that reduce vulnerability to \nenvironmental stress.\n20,21\n For example, in areas of high \nflood risk, all development may be prohibited, while in \n\nareas where the risk is lower, the ground floor of new \nbuildings and structures may be required to be built \nabove a minimum height to avoid flood damage.\n22 Given \nthat climate change often magnifies existing hazard risk, \n\nmunicipalities could respond by modifying existing zoning \nrestrictions to factor in the greater intensity, frequency or \nduration of certain hazards as climate changes.\nBeaubassin-est™s sea level rise protection zone\n23\nBeaubassin-est (population 6200), a small coastal community in southeast New Brunswick, is vulnerable to \n\nthe impacts of sea level rise and storm surge flooding. The Community is one of the first in New Brunswick \n\nto implement a minimum height standard for buildings to address climate change impacts. Council passed an \nupdated zoning bylaw in March 2011 to better protect new construction in the community™s coastal zone. \nThe bylaw identifies a sea level rise ﬁprotection zoneﬂ in which the minimum ground floor elevation of any new \nbuilding must be at least 1.43 metres above the current 1-in-100-year flood mark. The regulation is an overlay \nzone˜Œ all previous zoning conditions apply. Rather than restrict development outright, the zoning bylaw imposes \n\nstricter building requirements on developers. This new regulation provides an opportunity to educate developers \n\nas well as the community at large about the impacts of climate change and sea level rise. This update to the bylaw \n\nwas based on the best available scientific understanding of sea level rise for the area and a high resolution digital \nmap that the community commissioned to help identify potential flood levels. \nPHOTO COURTESY OF SÉBASTIEN DOIRON\n', 'LAND USE PLANNING TOOLS \n| 9 RosemontŒLa Petite-Patrie™s zoning bylaw to reduce the urban heat island effect\n24,25\nRosemontŒLa Petite-Patrie (population 131 000) is a central borough in Montréal, Quebec, that is very densely \nbuilt. The urban heat island effect is pronounced in many parts of the borough. Urban heat islands are areas in \n\ncities where ambient air temperatures tend to be hotter than in surrounding areas. They occur where there is little \nvegetation and a high percentage of dark surfaces, such as tar roofs, asphalt roads and parking lots. \nIn April 2011, the borough council revised its comprehensive zoning bylaw to include four regulatory measures \naimed at tackling urban heat islands: (1) when replacing an existing roof or constructing a new building, the owner \nmust install either a green roof or a highly reflective roof; (2) for all new parking lots of 10 or more spaces, at least \n\n15 percent of the area must be open ground landscaped with plants, bushes and trees; (3) all new paving materials \n\nmust meet a minimum specified surface reflectivity rating; and (4) when constructing a new building, at least \n\n20˜percent of the building site must remain open ground and be landscaped with plants, bushes and trees. \nThese four measures apply to all public and private property throughout the borough. More than 300 permits for \nreflective roofs were issued in the first year after the bylaw was passed. \nPHOTO COURTESY OF ROSEMONT Œ LA PETITE-PATRIE\n', '10 | LAND USE PLANNING TOOLS\n2.4 LAND SUBDIVISION AND DEVELOPMENT CONTROLS\nCommunities across Canada employ many different tools \nto control the layout and design of proposed developments \n\nand to reduce adverse impacts on the community. The \ncontrols, which may apply to subdivisions of land, new \nconstruction or alterations to existing buildings, allow local \n\nofficials to evaluate projects case by case.\n7 Among them are\nsubdivision controls Œ\n which apply when a developer \nwants to divide a parcel of land, often for residential \n\ndevelopment. Generally, subdivision plans must \n\ndemonstrate good access and efficient utility service \n\nfor all the proposed lots and also address concerns \n\nabout financial, environmental and other˜impacts.\nsite plan controls, development permits, \n\ndevelopment agreements and similar tools Œ\n which require developers to submit detailed designs \n\nto be assessed against specified criteria. For example, \na proposal may be reviewed for the quality of the \ndesign of public areas, the fit with the historic \n\ncharacter of the neighbourhood, or the extent of \n\ndisturbance to ecologically sensitive land.\ncomprehensive development zones, planned \n\nunit developments and similar instruments Œ\n that apply to large sites in which non-standard or \n\ninnovative designs and techniques are to be used, \n\nand a customised approach to zoning and site design \nis appropriate.\nAs part of the evaluation of proposals under these types \nof regulations, local officials may seek changes to projects \n\nprior to approval. Further, the developer may be required to \npay development charges, dedicate a portion of the site for \npublic use or provide some other concession or amenity.\nThese project-based, discretionary development controls \ncan be very useful for adapting to climate change at the \nneighbourhood scale. For example, as part of the review \nof a subdivision proposal, the developer may be asked to \n\nassess the increased risk of erosion due to climate change \n\nand to determine how it may affect the development. \n\nThe municipality may require that appropriate adaptation \nmeasures be taken by the developer, such as shoreline \nrestoration or increased development setbacks. The lots \n\nin a proposed subdivision may be clustered in the least \n\nhazardous part of the property. In other cases, a site plan \n\ncontrol ordinance may be used to require that green design \nfeatures that address the impacts of climate change be \nincorporated (for instance, providing shade and rooftop \n\ngardens to decrease the public health risk from urban \n\nheat˜islands). \nToronto™s Green Standard\nToronto, Ontario (population 2.6 million), is situated at the centre \n\nof a conurbation of more than 5 million people. Climate change \n\nimpacts of concern for the city include increased health risks due \nto extreme heat, higher incidence of pests and diseases (such as \nWest Nile virus) and more extreme rainfall with consequences for \n\nstorm-water systems and other infrastructure.\n26The Toronto Green Standard (TGS) is a set of performance \n\nmeasures for site and building design, covering energy and water \n\nefficiency, air and water quality, ecological services and solid waste \nmanagement. The standards work with the regular development \napproval and inspection process, and apply to all new development subject to subdivision or site plan controls or \n\nfor which a zoning amendment is required.\n27 Although adaptation is not explicitly mentioned, the TGS addresses \nseveral climate change impacts of concern to the city. For example, one provision, applicable to non-residential \n\ndevelopment of three stories or less, requires the use of light-coloured materials, open-grid pavement or shading \non at least 50 percent of the site to reduce urban heat. Another provision requires that new developments retain at \nleast the first 5 millimetres (mm) from each rainfall through rainwater reuse, plantings and other practices, thereby \n\nreducing storm water runoff. A more stringent set of voluntary standards has been adopted. Developments that \n\nmeet those stricter standards are eligible for reductions in development fees.\nPHOTO COURTESY OF \nTHE CITY OF TORONTO\n', 'LAND USE PLANNING TOOLS \n| 11 Halifax Regional Municipality development agreements\nHalifax Regional Municipality (HRM) (population 390 000) is the most populous urban community in Atlantic \nCanada and the capital of Nova Scotia. Climate change, which is expected to bring more frequent storms to the \n\narea, will likely increase the vulnerability of coastal development and infrastructure.\n28 \nVarious community plans, \nincluding the 2006 HRM Regional Plan, already call for new developments to be constructed a minimum height \n\nabove the ordinary high-water mark.\n29 \nOne flexible mechanism that planners in Halifax use to address coastal threats is development agreements. Certain \n\nareas of the community are designated as zones where review and approval of development projects proceed \n\nthrough negotiation. Local bylaws specify in general terms the matters to be considered in such negotiations, \ngiving planners latitude to address a broad range of issues regarding environmental protection, natural hazards \nand other concerns.\n30\n The developer may be asked to produce relevant information (such as the impacts of \nwave-run up on a particular property) and to consider and adopt appropriate hazard mitigation strategies. In a \n\nrecent development in downtown Dartmouth (an HRM municipality), local officials and the developer agreed to \nestablish minimum elevations for a new marina and other seaside structures that were several metres higher than \nprovided in area plans. This was consistent both with the developer™s interest in protecting the property and the \n\ncommunity™s interest in minimizing risk. The development agreement process enabled planners and developers to \n\nexchange information on storm surge and wave run up on this site, and to produce a more resilient project design. \nPHOTO COURTESY OF HALIFAX REGIONAL MUNICIPALITY\n', '12 | LAND USE PLANNING TOOLS\n2.5 COVENANTS AND EASEMENTS\nCovenants and easements (known as real servitudes in \nQuebec) are formal agreements that place restrictions on \n\nthe use of land or grant a person (or the public) the right \nto use land owned by another.\n31,32\n For example, a covenant \nmay prohibit building a structure that casts a shadow on \na neighbouring property. An easement may allow the \npublic to pass through private land to reach a beach. Both \ncovenants and easements are said to ﬁrun with the land,ﬂ \n\nwhich means they bind current as well as future owners. \n\nThere are strict and complex legal requirements that apply \n\nwhen creating easements or covenants. \nCovenants may serve local planning goals in different ways: \nas a development control tool Œ\n Municipalities \nmay use covenants when entering development \nagreements, applying controls on subdivisions and \nother development projects or imposing conditions \n\non issuing a development permit. In such cases, \n\nthese instruments ensure that community interests \n\nare protected and that the developer™s promises \nabout the operation and maintenance of the \nproperty are enforceable long after construction. \n\nCovenants may be used in ﬁgreen developmentsﬂ \n\nthat use innovative energy, waste water treatment \nand other systems that require public access and the \ncollaboration of future owners for proper operation \n\nand maintenance.\n33as a conservation tool Œ \nA special form of \ncovenant, known as a conservation covenant or \n\neasement has been established by law in many \nprovinces. It places restrictions on the use of land to \nprotect its natural values.

The tool helps TPH \nand community partners identify and prioritize \n\ngeographic hot spots for delivering resources during \n\na heat alert. The City also plans to use the tool for \n\nlong-term climate adaptation planning. \nMaps and other landscape visualizations can illustrate, in \n\na simple and effective manner,\n78\n the nature and extent of \nthe changes expected in the local climate, the severity of \n\npossible impacts, and what proposed adaptation responses \nmight look like. Such visualizations support decision making \nby translating scientific concepts into maps or images \n\nthat have clear and practical meaning to non-scientists \n\nand the public. They can facilitate dialogue during the \n\nplanning˜process.\nMAPS\nMaps are one of the most common adaptation decision-\n\nsupport tools used by planners. They can range from \n\nsimple hand-drawn maps to those developed by using \nsophisticated computer software. Maps have been used \nto identify geographic areas of the municipality at risk \n\nfrom climate-related impacts, the location of vulnerable \n\ninfrastructure and populations, or to demarcate places \n\nwhere certain adaptation-related policies apply. For \nexample, the potential extent of shoreline erosion or storm \nsurge flooding under various climate change scenarios \ncan be mapped. Maps can also be readily referenced or \n\nincorporated into land use planning tools, such as zoning \n\nbylaws, official plans and policy documents. \nVISUALIZATIONS\nIncreasingly, municipalities employ computer animation \n\nsoftware to create three-dimensional visualizations at the \n\nstreet and neighbourhood scales. The software combines \nimages of the existing features of the community (for \nexample, roads, buildings and trees near the shore) with \n\nclimate-related impacts projected for the area (for example, \n\nhigher sea level). The animations help people visualize \n\nthe losses that may be incurred under such conditions \nand illustrate the consequences of a particular adaptation \nmeasure. For example, planners may want to create an \n\nimage showing how raising a dike or levee would affect \n\nviews of the ocean from various waterfront properties. The \nresulting images may be useful in engaging the affected \nland owners and the public when evaluating the merits of a \n\nproposed adaptation measure, such as raising a sea dike.\nMAP COURTESY OF TORONTO PUBLIC HEALTH\n', 'LAND USE PLANNING TOOLS \n| 27 Delta™s visualization of climate change impacts\n80,81\nDelta, British Columbia (population 99 863), is 17 kilometres south of Vancouver, at the mouth of the Fraser River. \nThe low-lying community is at risk of flooding from sea level rise and increased intensity and frequency of storm \n\nsurges.\n82 Since 2005, Delta has partnered with the Collaborative for Advanced Landscape Planning (CALP) at \nthe University of British Columbia (UBC) to develop visualizations of the flooding risk to Delta. CALP and UBC™s \n\nOkanagan campus developed a 3D virtual environment where Delta residents could see what adaptation actions \nwould look like. For example, the following image shows a typical residential street inundated by flood waters \nfollowing a major storm surge event. Delta officials found the visualization process useful in engaging local \n\nresidents. Since the public consultations in 2007, Delta has integrated adaptation into various infrastructure and \n\noperational decisions. \n', '28 | LAND USE PLANNING TOOLS\n3.5 ADAPTATION PLANNING GUIDEBOOKS\nWindsor™s Climate Change Adaptation Plan\nWindsor (population 216 000) is located in southwestern Ontario on the south shore of the Detroit River and Lake \nSt. Clair. Climate change impacts of concern include an expected increase in the frequency and intensity of heavy \n\nrain storms and heat waves (a doubling of the number of 30°C days has been projected by 2050).\n83\n These changes \ncould pose serious problems for the city. In 2010, for example, a significant rainstorm that delivered 90 mm of rain \n\nin a 24-hour period led to widespread basement flooding throughout the city.\n84Windsor began developing its adaptation plan in 2010. The City is working through the five-step adaptation \n\nplanning process outlined in \nChanging Climate, Changing Communities\n, a guidebook published by ICLEI Canada.\n85 The steps are initiate, research, plan, implement and monitor. The City is midway through that planning process. \n\nThe development of Windsor™s adaptation plan builds on existing initiatives, including a heat alert and emergency \nresponse system, the expansion of a waste water treatment facility, various initiatives aimed at reducing basement \nflooding, and the construction of a new retention treatment basin to reduce combined sewer overflows. City officials \n\nintend to integrate the actions identified in the adaptation plan into existing policies, programs and operations.\nPHOTO COURTESY OF TOURISM WINDSOR ESSEX PELEE ISLAND\nSeveral Canadian guidebooks have been produced that \n\ndescribe the steps a community can take to formulate \n\nan adaptation strategy and action plan (see Appendix B). \nSeveral of these guidebooks outline a standard planning \nprocess that is then tailored with information that is \n\nrelevant to preparing for the impacts of climate change. \nThe guidebooks are typically based on the experience and \n\ninsights of pilot communities and may include case studies \n\nand prepared worksheets, as well as tips and practical \ninformation. The other decision-support tools described in \nthis document Œ visualizations, vulnerability and risk assess\n-ments, and scenario planning Œ may be included within the \nadaptation planning process described in the guidebooks. \n', 'LAND USE PLANNING TOOLS \n| 29 Nova Scotia™s \nMunicipal Climate Change Action Plan Guidebook\n: Yarmouth \npilot˜project \nThe Town of Yarmouth (population 6761) is on the \nGulf of Maine in southwestern Nova Scotia. The town \n\nis vulnerable to sea level rise and storm surge flooding. \nIn 2010, the Government of Nova Scotia required \nmunicipalities to prepare and submit a climate change \n\naction plan by 2013 as a condition for receiving federal \n\ngas-tax funds. In November 2011, the Province published \n\nthe \nMunicipal Climate Change Action Plan Guidebook\n to help municipalities prepare their action plans.\n86 Yarmouth was one of three pilot communities to work \n\nthrough the Guidebook. The lessons learned were used \nto assist other municipalities in undertaking similar \ninitiatives.\nYarmouth is developing a long-term strategic approach \nfor managing climate change hazards. Between October \n\n2011 and February 2012, with assistance from the \n\nDalhousie School of Planning, Yarmouth worked through the six steps in the Guidebook. Before submitting its \n\nPlan to the Province in 2013, the Town intends to host a public consultation session and continue to refine its \nAction Plan. Despite some challenges, town staff found it to be a useful process. In particular, the formation of \nthe steering committee, composed of staff from different departments, has allowed colleagues to work together \n\nacross functional areas.\n Steps to develop an action plan\n1. Build an adaptation team/committee. \n2. Assess impacts and hazards.\n3. Identify affected locations.\n4.\n Identify and evaluate the impacts to \naffected facilities, infrastructure and \n\nservices. \n5.\n Identify local social, economic and \n\nenvironment considerations. \n6.\n Determine priorities for adaptive actions.\nPHOTO COURTESY OF MICHAEL BLASER\n', '30 | LAND USE PLANNING TOOLS\nAppendix A\n Provincial and territorial role in local adaptation planning\nPROVINCES\nUnder the Canadian constitution, provinces have jurisdiction \nover many matters of local concern including land use \n\nplanning.\n87,88\n Accordingly, Provinces play a role in land use \nplanning for local adaptation to climate change through \nenabling legislation\n Œ Provinces enact and revise \nlaws that guide planning by local and regional \n\nauthorities. Those laws establish the regulatory and \n\npolicy tools that control land use at the local level \n\nand define how and when they may be used. For \nexample, provincial planning acts prescribe the kinds \nof zoning bylaws a municipality may adopt. The \n\nprovinces define the suite of tools available to local \n\ngovernment to design and implement adaptation \n\nplans and measures.\nprovincial planning policies\n Œ Provinces adopt \nregulations and policies, to which local and regional \n\nplans generally must conform, on planning issues \n\nof concern across the province. Those policies may \naddress topics relevant to local adaptation efforts. For \ninstance, a province may prescribe planning standards \n\ndesigned to protect agricultural land and contain \n\nurbanization at the fringes of a metropolitan area. \nThose standards may facilitate enhanced regional \nfood security and the design of more resilient urban \n\ncommunities.\nprovincial adaptation plans and programs\n Œ Many provinces have their own formal plans for \n\nadapting to climate change. Typically, such plans \n\nspecify provincial goals and objectives; identify the \n\nimpacts of climate change on government programs, \n\noperations and infrastructure; and suggest specific \nactions. For example, a plan may call for more high-\ndefinition aerial mapping or enhanced monitoring of \n\nwater quality. Provinces also disseminate guidelines \n\nand technical information and can act as facilitators \n\nand conveners to assist local governments, the private \nsector and civic organizations in adapting to climate \nchange. Finally, provinces fund programs that can \n\nsupport local adaptation (for example, subsidies for \n\nan urban tree planting program to reduce the urban \n\nheat island effect). \ndirect involvement in development decisions\n˜Œ In most local planning matters, the provincial \n\ngovernment plays an indirect, oversight role (for \n\ninstance, as appellate bodies on a zoning dispute \n\nor as the final approving authority on local official \nplans). In some circumstances, provincial officials \nare directly involved in local development decisions. \n\nThis may be the case for sites and issues that fall \n\nunder direct provincial jurisdiction, such as highway \n\nconstruction, unincorporated communities, local \nprojects on crown land, projects affecting heritage \nproperties, and environmental assessments of large \n\ninfrastructure projects. In such cases, provincial \n\nofficials may contribute directly to decisions on the \n\ndesign and implementation of local adaptation \nmeasures.\nintergovernmental relations\n Œ Provinces negotiate \nagreements, collaborate on programs and projects, \nand manage their relations with other provinces \nand the federal government. In that capacity, a \nprovince can help set the conditions for participation \n\nby local governments in programs that support or \n\ncomplement adaptation. An example is the set of \n\nagreements between the Government of Canada and \nvarious provinces governing the allocation of federal \ngas-tax funds. \nThe nature and extent of provincial involvement in local \n\nadaptation planning varies between provinces, depending \non legal and institutional frameworks, the planning culture \nand practice of each location, and many other factors.\nTERRITORIES\nLike provincial governments, the governments of the \n\nterritories of Nunavut, the Northwest Territories and \n\nYukon have jurisdiction over land use planning and many \nother local matters. However, these legislative powers do \nnot spring directly from the Constitution but instead are \n\ndelegated to the territories by the Government of Canada \n\nunder various laws.\n89,90,91\n Territorial governments in turn \nenact legislation and adopt policies to guide planning by \n\nlocal and regional authorities within their borders.\n92,93\n', 'LAND USE PLANNING TOOLS \n| 31 While the legal framework for land use planning in the \nterritories differs from that in the provinces, the roles \n\nthat territorial governments play in adaptation to climate \nchange roughly correspond to those described in the \nProvinces section of this appendix. For example, territorial \ngovernments also adopt climate change strategies and \n\nactions plans.\n94,95,96\n Territorial land-use planning practices \nand territorial government involvement in local adaptation \n\nplanning vary by territory, depending on the enabling \nfederal legislation and other factors.\nBritish Columbia™s Climate Action Plan\n97British Columbia released its Climate Action Plan in June 2008. Chapter 5 describes the Province™s vision, strategies \nand activities as it prepares for climate change. In responding to the increased likelihood of severe weather events, \n\nthe provincial government is taking action to (1) ensure that new development on flood plains will be flood-proofed \nto provincial standards, (2) consider the impacts of climate change when awarding provincial infrastructure grants, \n(3) develop a comprehensive plan for green community development and (4) ensure that community development \n\nstrategies recognize the importance of streams and rivers. The Province is currently updating its planning policy \n\nstatements and guidelines, including the Guidelines for Management of Coastal Flood Hazard Land Use. The \n\nGuidelines describe new land use tools that local governments may adopt, including sea level rise planning areas and \nrisk-based zoning.\n98 Prince Edward Island™s Climate Change Strategy\n99Prince Edward Island™s Climate Change Strategy outlines measures to both reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to \ndeal with the impacts of climate change. The strategy adopts a risk-based approach to adaptation as it ﬁis the most \n\npractical way to ensure that adaptation responses are socially acceptable, cost-effective and consistent with the \ncommunity™s wider social, environmental and economic goals.ﬂ The impacts of climate change on coasts Œ such as sea \nlevel rise, increased storm surge flooding and erosion Œ are highlighted as issues of concern. The strategy identifies \n\nfive overarching adaptation objectives and actions, all of which have direct implications at the municipal level. For \n\nexample, the Province committed to reviewing all provincial land use and development policies to encourage more \n\nsustainable options for future land development and to better adapt to changing climate conditions.\nManitoba™s \nProvincial Planning Regulation\n Manitoba™s \nProvincial Planning Regulation\n100\n (the Regulation) identifies both climate change mitigation and adaptation \nas strategic priorities, along with other key concerns such as clean water and public safety. Community resilience is \n\nrecognized as a key principle of sound land use planning. \nThe Regulation identifies issues of provincial interest to be addressed in local development plans and goals to be \npursued in various policy areas. For instance, with respect to general development policy, the provincial interest \nincludes directing development toward areas where risk can be minimized and taking into account climate change \nvulnerabilities. With regard to water, provincial interest includes the development of strategies to prioritize allocation \n\nand implementation of conservation measures to build community resilience. The Regulation prohibits certain kinds of \n\ndevelopment in or near water bodies and prescribes minimum setbacks for new development. The policy on planning \n\nfor agriculture recognizes the potential increased demand for food production in response to climate change and \nencourages local authorities to promote food security. At a strategic level, the Regulation requires that each local \nplanning authority assess local vulnerabilities to climate change and consider existing climate change action plans \n\nwhen preparing, amending or replacing the local development plan. \n', '32 | LAND USE PLANNING TOOLS\nAppendix B\n Additional resources on select decision-support tools\nVISUALIZING CLIMATE \nCHANGE˜IMPACTS\nLocal Climate Change Visioning and Landscape \nVisualizations: Guidance Manual \n(2010). \nThis manual, published by the Centre for Advanced \n\nLandscape Planning at the University of British Columbia, \n\nassists communities in developing climate change visioning \nprocesses. \nhttp://www.calp.forestry.ubc.ca/news/viz-guidance-manual/\nADAPTATION PLANNING GUIDANCE\nClimate Change Adaptation Planning: A Handbook \nfor Small Canadian Communities \n(Canadian Institute \nof Planners, 2011)\nThe handbook helps small Canadian communities prepare \nand implement a climate change adaptation plan.
