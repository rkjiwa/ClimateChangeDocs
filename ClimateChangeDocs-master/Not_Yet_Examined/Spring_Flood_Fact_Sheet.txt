['1 !    While spring brings the promise of warm weather and \nlonger days, it also brings a variety of \nconditions \nthat can \ninclud\ne heavy rains\n, severe weather\n, and rapid snowmelt that can increase your flood risk.\n DonÕt be caught off guard\n.  Get the facts.\n  Know the risks. \n Take action to protect yourself, your family\n, your business, \nand your finances\nÑbefore a weather event occurs and itÕs too late.\n SPRING\n FLOOD\n RISKS\n Spring Thaw\n.  Warmer temperatures and resulting snow melt can produce large amounts of \nrun\noff in a \nshort period of time\n, as \neach cubic foot of compacted snow contains gallons of water.  \nDuring the \nearly \nspring, \nfrozen land prevents melting snow or rainfall from seeping into the ground\n.  The water then runs \noff the surface and flows into lakes, \nstreams\n, and rivers, causing excess water to spill over their banks.\n  Add s\neasonal\n storms\n to the mix\n, and the result\n is often severe spring flooding.\n Spring Rains.  \nSpring storms can bring several inches of precipitation in just hours or can stall out over\n an area for days. \n These heavy rains \ncan lead to \nsevere \nflooding by oversaturat\ning\n the \nground, \noverfill\ning\n storm drains\n, or \ncausing \nrivers \nto \nspill over their banks or levees.\n    Flash Flooding.\n  A flash flood is a rapid flooding of low\n-lying areas in les\ns than six hours, which is \ncaused by intense rainfall from a thunderstorm or several thunderstorms.\n  Flash floods can also occur \nwhen there are drought\n-like conditions.\n  Levees and Dams.\n  The U.S. has thousands of miles of\n levees and dams that are designed\n to protect \nagainst a certain level\n of flooding. \n These structures can\n erode and weaken over time, and\n they can \nalso be overtopped\nÑor even fail\nÑduring large\nr flood events.\n KNOW YOUR RISK\n Everyone is at risk for spring flooding, yet many remain unprotected.\n  Just a few inches of water can \ncause tens of thousands of dollars in damage.  \nBetween 2006 and 2010, the average flood claim was \nnearly $34,000.\n  ThatÕs more than many survivors can afford to pay out of pocket for damages due to \nflooding\n, and without flo\nod insurance, many must cover the costs to repair or rebuild on their own.  \nConsider your risk and the consequences of a flood event, and make the choice to protect yourself.\n BE FLOODSMART \nÐ REDUCE YOUR RISK\n A flood does not have to be a catastrophic event\n to bring high out\n-of-pocket costs, and you do\nnÕt\n have \nto live in a high\n-risk flood area to suffer flood damage.  Around twenty percent of flood insurance claims \noccur in moderate\n-to-low\n-risk zones.  Property owners should remember:\n ! The time to prepare is \nnow.  Visit \nready.gov\n/floods\n for more on family preparedness for \nflood \nand other \nemergencies.  There are a number of steps individuals and families can take to better \nprepare themselves for flooding and reduce t\nheir risks.  Remember to have a family evacuation \nplan, put an emergency kit together, and keep important papers and valuables in a safe, dry place.\n Gather supplies in case of a storm, strengthen your home against damage, and review your \ninsurance coverage\ns.  \n ! Only flood insurance covers flood damage.  \nMost standard homeowners policies do not cover \nflood damage. \nRemember: i\nt typically takes 30 days for a new flood insurance policy to go into \neffect, so get your policy now.\n  Flood insurance is \nalso \naffordabl\ne.  An average flood policy costs \naround $600 a year, and rates start at just $129 a year for homes in moderate\n-to-low\n-risk areas.\n    !"#$%&\'()**+$%&,\'-$./.\'0\n%+\'1#*2342$*%\n\'!"#$%&\'(\n%)"\'(*+%,-\'!\n% ', ' 2  !"#"$%&\'()"$*"+,-\'.%+%*")"+/\'0*"+,-\n\'Visit \nfloodsmart.gov\n (or call \n1-800-427-2419) to learn\n more about individual flo\nod ris\nk, explore \ncoverage options\n, and to find an agent in your area.\n Before A Flood\n !
