Taking action on your own\nSeal cracks in foundation walls and basement !oorsSealing cracks is a simple way to help reduce basement \n"ooding inyour home. In many cases, cracks can be effectively sealed from inside.\nMost of the time, you should not have to dig anywhere beside the\nfoundation to repair them. \nDisconnect your downspouts, add extensions and splash padsDownspouts are designed to\nconvey water from eavestroughs\nand down the side of thehouse. Downspouts often direct\nwater to the surface of the lot,but in many cases they may beconnected to the weeping tileor the sanitary sewer lateral. ¥  Downspout extensions shouldbe directed at least\n1.8 metres (6 ft) away from\nthe home, and the "owsshould be directed over\npermeable surfaces, such as lawns or gardens, and not paved\nsurfaces including driveways or walkways.¥  Talk to your municipal government \nbeforeyou do this.When connected to the municipal sanitary sewer system, eavestrough\ndownspouts can contribute asubstantial amount of water tothese systems.

Questions for a plumberIn many cases, it is the more substantive measures that are the most\neffective way to reduce basement \n"ooding. Many of these require the\nassistance of a licensed plumber. Municipal governments often require\npermits for the plumbing and drainage improvements described in this\ndocument. Talk to your municipal government to make sure you or\nthe person you have hired have the proper permits.\nIs poor grading causing my !ooding? The slope of your yard is very important to keep water away from your\nhome and foundation. This helps keep the basement dry. You should:\n¥ Check your lot to see if your yard slopes away from your home. Look\neverywhere\n, including under stairs and decks.The soil directly beside your foundation wall\nshould be approximately 10 cm to 15 cm\nhigher than the soil 1.5 metres away from the\nfoundation.¥ If you notice that the ground close to the\nfoundation of your house has settled besideyour foundation wall, !ll it in with a solid,compactable soil Ð like clay Ð so that there is \na constant slope away from the foundation.\n¥ Talk to the department in your municipal government that is\nresponsible for building inspections and stormwater drainage about\nswales (the grassy depressions that help direct water away from\nhomes) and lot grading. Ask them where swales should be on your\nproperty, and where water from your lot should be directed.\nDo I have a weeping tile?A weeping tile or foundation drain is an underground perforated pipe\nthat runs along the bottom of a homeÕs foundation. Older Canadian\nhomes, for example those built before the1940s or1950s, may not\nhave foundation drains. If you !nd that your home does not have afoundation drain and you experience serious in!ltration "ooding, youshould consider having a foundation drain installed.Typical backyard swale with a drain.\nICLR-SL BaseFlood-D10 Jun18-12 E-FINAL_x  12-06-18  12:40 PM  Page 4', '5If you do have a foundation drain, it can become clogged with debrisor collapse in some sections. A plumber will need to decide if it can be!xed or it needs to be replaced.\nIf a plumber does !x or replace\nthe weeping tile, ICLRrecommends including a clean-\nout port with access from the\nsurface to allow easiermaintenance in the future.\nWhat is my weeping tileconnected to?A weeping tile that is directly connected to your homeÕs\nsanitary sewer lateral increases the amount of water that\nenters the municipal sewer system during a heavy rainfall.Disconnecting your weeping tile from the sanitary or storm\nsewer can help reduce the chances that you and your\nneighbours will experience basement "ooding. It can also reduce the\nrisk of structural damage to your home.Do I have a sump-pump?When weeping tiles are disconnected from sewer laterals, a sump-pit\nand sump-pump must be installed. The sump-pump is used to pumpwater from the weeping tiles to the lotÕs surface. In some unique cases,\nmunicipalities may recommend a sump-pump to pump weeping tile\nwater to the storm sewer system.Is my sump-pump working correctly?Sump-pumps get blocked and can fail if they are not routinely\ninspected and maintained. On-going maintenance helps toensure the sump-pump keeps working long term. You can\ninspect the sump-pump by pouring water into the sump pit,and seeing whether or not the pump starts automatically. \nSump-pumps need electricity. They \nstop workingduring a powerfailure. You should use a back-up system to make sure the pump works\nwhen you need it.

The device allows sewage to "ow inonly one direction Ð out of your house. When sewage begins to move\ntoward your basement, the valve closes. Some municipalities offer\nsubsidies to offset the cost of installing a backwater valve.

If the weeping tiles are still connected to the sanitary sewer lateral\ndownstream of the valve, sewage could be forced back into the\nweeping tiles and lead to structural damage to the foundation, thiscan also lead to in!ltration "ooding.Like other parts of your home, backwater valves require periodic\nmaintenance to ensure proper performance. An improperly maintained\nvalve may fail during a "ood. Most mainline backwater valves comewith a see-through top so you can check to see if it is clogged with\ndebris. The valve should be checked regularly to ensure that it will\nfunction properly when it is needed. You will likely need the help of a\nquali!ed plumber to carry out maintenance of the valve. After a backwater valve has been installed do not use plumbing, forexample, "ushing toilets, running dishwashers, washing machines, orrunning taps, etc. during intense rainfall events. If the home plumbingis used when the backwater valve is closed, water will have no way to exit your home until the valve has reopened. If youÕre not sure if the\nvalve is closed, check it Ð you should be able to see it through the\nclear, plastic top.\nFOOTINGBACKWATER FLOW VALVE\nBASEMENT WALL\nBACKFILLZONE SUMPPITSUMP-PUMP       PSUMP PUMPDISCHARGE LINETO SURFACE\nWEEPING TILECONNECTEDTO SUMP PIT        CLEANOUTSEALED CAP    SANITARY\nSERVICE\nLATERAL\n      Backwater valve and sump-pumpICLR-SL BaseFlood-D10 Jun18-12 E-FINAL_x  12-06-18  12:40 PM  Page 8', '9Are my sewer laterals working properly? Sewer laterals, the pipes that connect a homeÕs plumbing system to\nthe municipal underground sewer system, should be regularly\nmaintained. Over time, the sanitary sewer lateral can get clogged withfats, oils and grease (FOGS) or other debris, which can restrict \n"owsand cause sewer backup. This may especially be a problem in older\nhomes when the lateral has not been routinely maintained. Sewer\nlaterals are accessed through the cleanout port, which may be located\neither inside of the basement or outside of the home, close to where\nthe lateral enters the home. To \n!nd out how well your sanitary sewer lateral has been maintained,you should talk to a licensed plumber who can carry out a camerainspection of your lateral. A plumbing inspection will identify if it iscontributing to your "ood risk. Some communities recommend that\nhomeowners replace their sewer lateral every 30 years or so.\nBasement windowsIf your basement windows are\nclose to the surface of theground, window wells and\nwindow well covers can reduce\nthe crevasses that allow water\nto enter.
