For example, warmer annual \ntemperatures associated with \nclimate change have accelerated t\nhe \nretreat of the Kaskawulsh glacier, \nwhich led to a sudden diversion of \nwater from the Slims River to the \nAlsek River in 2016. This resulted in \na substantial drop in water levels in \nthe Slims River and in \nKluane Lake, \nwhich impacts\n \nthe communities of \nBurw\nash Landing and Destruction \nBay. \n \n \nVariability Wi\nthin Long\n-\nTerm Trends\n \nLong\n-\nterm climate trends are important, but these \nbroader changes are driven in part by short\n-\nterm \nweather variability. Extreme swings in temperature and \nprecipitation can have serious impacts on everything \nfrom infrastructure to wild\nlife breeding cycles, but \nincreases in the severity, frequency or duration of \nextreme events are not easily captured in long\n-\nterm \ntrends. For example, a one degree increase in average \nannual temperature can mean 25 days where \ntemperatures are 15 degrees ab\nove the seasonal \nnormal if climate remains at normal levels the rest of \nthe year. This example shows how averaging change in \ntemperature throughout the year can hide the extent of \nextreme temperature variability.\n \n', 'Y\nukon \n\nState of Play\n\n \nAnalysis of Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation\n \nNovember 14\n, 2017\n \n \n \n \nRESEARCH NORTHWEST &\n \nMORRISON HERSHFIELD\n \n5\n \n \nand \nin \nculturally and ecologically important places\n.\n \nThese and other related changes present a \nwide range of challenges and opportunities\n \nfor future adaptation efforts in Yukon. \n \n2.1\n \nH\nISTORICAL\n \nC\nHANGES IN\n \nT\nEMPERATURE\n \nAND \nP\nRECIPITATION\n \nT\nhe strongest measure of climate change in Yukon \nis\n \nrelative\n \nchange in annual temperature. The \na\nnnual average temperature has increased 2\n°\nC over the past 50\n \nyears, while winter \ntemperatures have increased 4\n°\nC\n. These temperature\ns\n \nare understood to be increasing at\n \ntwice \nthe rate of s\nouthe\nrn Canada and the global average\n.\n \nThis rise in temperature means that winters \nare getting shorter and spring and fall are ge\ntting relati\nvely longer. There are \nsignificantly \nf\newe\nr \nvery cold days in the winter but no significant change in the number of very hot days\n \n(above \n30\no\nC) in the summer. \n(\nFurgal and Prowse, 2008\n; \nLarsen et\n \nal., \n2015\n). \n \nWarmer average temperatures \nare \nassociated with a wide variety of impacts on Yukon \ncommunities\n \nand landscapes. For example, more rapid \npermafrost \nthaw \nis resulting in an \nincrease in \nimpacts \non \ncommunity\n \ninfrastructure\n \nbuilt\n \non permafrost areas. W\narmer \ntemperatures have \nalso \nresulted in w\nidespread me\nlting of glaciers and the rate of melt \ncontinues to increase\n. \nYukon \nhas lost 22% of its glacial cover over the last 50 years\n \n(\nDerksen et \nal. 2012). \n \nAnnual precipitation\n \n(rain and snowfall)\n, another \nimportant indicator of climate change, has increased \nby 6% \nin the Yukon \nover the past 50 years, with the \ngreatest increase seen during the summer months\n \n(Streicker, 2016). \nChanges\n \nin precipitation \ncause \nchanges in surface and ground water\n, permaf\nrost, \nvegetation and wildlife. Yukoners have experienced \nhigher summer precipitation and more extreme rain \nevents\n,\n \nassociat\ned flood events, permafrost thaw\n \n(more snow cover traps heat in the ground)\n, and \nriver bank erosion. T\nhe trend points towards a \nfurth\ner\n \nincrease in annual precipitation and possibly \nmore extreme variability in precipitation as well.\n \nYukoners have observed an increase in short\n-\nterm \nextremes in temperature and precipitation and data \nsuggests that variability is increasing in Yukon\n. \nProjec\nted future changes in temperature and \nprecipitation s\nuggest that short\n-\nterm \nextremes will \nhappen more often (Streicker, 2016). \n \nFigure \n1\n \nshows how win\nter temperatures in \n2015/2016 departed from the 1961\n-\n1990 average across Canada.

In \n2015\n-\n16 El Nino contributed to \nYukon winter temperatures that \nwere almost 7\n0\nC above seasonal \naverages (Environment Canada, \n2017). Typically, El Nino years have \nbeen observed 5 out of every 100 \nyears, but n\new research suggests \nthat global climate warming is likely \nto increase the number of El Nino \nevents to 10 in every 100 years \nunder current emission scenarios\n \n(Guojian, et al., 2017).  \n \n', 'Y\nukon \n\nState of Play\n\n \nAnalysis of Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation\n \nNovember 14\n, 2017\n \n \n \n \nRESEARCH NORTHWEST &\n \nMORRISON HERSHFIELD\n \n6\n \n \nFigure \n1\n: Temperature Departures from the 1960\n-\n91 Average \n\n \nWinter 2015/2016 \n \n \n(Env\nironment and Climate Change Canada, 2017)\n \n2.2\n \nE\nXPECTED \nF\nUTURE \nC\nHANGE\nS\n \nIN\n \nT\nEMPERATURE\n \nAND \nP\nRECIPITATION \n \nThe \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\n \nhas developed three scenarios for future \ntemperature changes for \nPolar Regions\n.\n \nAll scenarios show \nboth \nan \nincrease in t\nemperature and \nits variability. \nTemperature is projected to increase by more than 2°C over the next 50 years\n \nin \nYukon (Streicker, 2016)\n.
